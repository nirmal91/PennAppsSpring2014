A security guard has been charged with stealing a painting by Georgia O'Keeffe and $14,000 from the O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. The police would not say whether the guard, William Crumpton, who telephoned the police to report a burglary in progress, is a suspect in the disappearance of a second O'Keeffe painting from another Santa Fe museum last month. The money was recovered, as was the painting, ''Red Canna 1919.'' The missing painting is ''Special 21 (Palo Duro Canyon).''
