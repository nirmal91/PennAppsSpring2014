A.F.C. DIVISIONAL PLAYOFF
8:15 p.m., CBS  Tennessee Titans (13-4) at New England Patriots (14-2)
The forecast is for frigid temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees at kickoff and a wind chill around -15.
Quarterback Steve McNair, the league's co-most valuable player, brings the Titans back to Gillette Stadium, where they lost, 38-30, on Oct. 5. The Titans scored 30 points on a team that allowed an average of only 6.8 points per game at home this season (a record low since the N.F.L. put in a 16-game schedule in 1978).
In fact, the New England defense did not allow a point in three of its last four home games and the Patriots have won 12 straight home games. The Patriots are eerily good at home. Quarterback Tom Brady did not throw an interception in 240 pass attempts at home this season.
The Patriots have a plus-17 turnover differential. Jeff Fisher, Tennessee's coach, firmly believes in running the ball and stopping the run in the playoffs. He will ride his running game and Eddie George and hope that McNair, with a little help, can do the rest.
Watch the sack leaders for both teams -- end Jevon Kearse for Tennessee and linebacker Mike Vrabel for New England -- who each have 9.5 sacks. Vrabel, especially, always has his nose in the middle of big plays.
