To the Editor:
''A Top Khmer Rouge Leader, Going Public, Pleads Ignorance'' (news article, Jan. 3):
It disheartens my Cambodian-American family to think that a top Khmer Rouge official can still think that the world is ignorant enough to believe his claims of nonparticipation in the genocidal war.
My parents came to the United States as refugees in 1980, where I learned about the killing fields as a child growing up far from Cambodia. How can Khieu Samphan claim to be unaware of the atrocities, especially since he lived inside of Cambodia, as an official Khmer Rouge leader? His mind is more boggled about realizing his historical mistakes, rather than accepting the modern consequences of them.
It is this mask of ''contrition'' that throws a final blow to the Khmer victims and their ancestors around the world.
