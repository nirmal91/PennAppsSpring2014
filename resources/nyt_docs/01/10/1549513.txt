Pete Rose has the most hits in baseball history, but he is no match for a former president when it comes to book signings.
''Jimmy Carter was the largest,'' said Daryl Mattson, the area marketing manager for Borders.
Fans and the curious showed up by the hundreds yesterday at the Borders on Broadway near Wall Street for the latest stop on Rose's book and confession tour. They kept Rose's pen flowing for two hours, until more than 1,000 copies of ''My Prison Without Bars'' were sold, said Jeremy Katz, the executive editor for Rodale Press, which published the book. In the book, Rose admits he bet on baseball games while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds.
Thomas Kutch, a uniformed officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, rushed in with a baseball for Rose to autograph. When told by Rose's handlers that he would sign only books, Kutch replied, ''Not even for a federal officer?'' Rose obliged, and Kutch beamed.
Many of the people at the store agreed that Rose, 62, should be admitted into the Hall of Fame. He has been barred from baseball since 1989 for wagering on games.
Laura Stockmyer of Queens said she bought the book because she was trying to think ahead.
''I do believe once he's no longer here, they'll then put him in the Hall of Fame,'' she said, ''and then I'll have a book signed by someone in the Hall of Fame.''
