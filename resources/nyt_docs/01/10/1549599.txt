The State Court of Appeals ruled that a lower court order barring a gay man in a custody dispute ''from taking the child around or otherwise exposing the child to his gay lover(s) and/or his gay lifestyle'' was not overly broad and was properly issued. But it reversed the contempt citation that put the man, Joseph R. Hogue Jr., in jail for two days for telling his son he is gay, saying the statement did not violate the order.
