As he worked to fend off a perceived surge by Gen. Wesley K. Clark in New Hampshire, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman released his third new advertisement there this week, this one focused on his plan for a middle-class tax cut. ''It's a bold idea to cut taxes for 98 percent of America's taxpayers,'' an announcer says in the 30-second television commercial. The spot is intended to help ''carve out the constituency here to come in as the alternative'' to Howard Dean, said Mark Penn, a senior campaign adviser. But, without mentioning Mr. Clark by name, the advertisement uses the line of attack Mr. Lieberman uses when comparing himself with the general, whose tax-cut proposal affects far fewer taxpayers, the senator said.
