The food retailer Royal Ahold said that its fourth-quarter sales fell 10.8 percent, to 12.7 billion euros ($16.2 billion). The annual sales showed a similar decline, but the company's share price rallied as a result of better-than-expected sales at Albert Hein, its flagship store in the Netherlands. Ahold blamed the weakness of the dollar for the slide in sales. Same-store sales in the United States, where Ahold owns the Stop &amp; Shop chain, were flat.
