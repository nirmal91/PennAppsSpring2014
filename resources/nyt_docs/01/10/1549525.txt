A private delegation of American experts arrived here Saturday morning after a five-day visit to North Korea in which they said they had interviewed a range of top officials and visited the nuclear plant at Yongbyon.
''We did go to Yongbyon,'' John W. Lewis, a Stamford University professor who led the delegation, said at an impromptu news conference at the Beijing airport. ''We are a private delegation. We were not there to negotiate. We were not there to be inspectors.''
American intelligence experts say they believe that some spent nuclear fuel at Yongbyon may have been reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium.
Professor Lewis declined to provide details about the visit because he said members of the delegation wanted first to brief the United States government.
But he said he and others in the group were likely to speak publicly about their trip in the coming days.
Professor Lewis is the director of the center for International Security and Cooperation, a group that promotes discussions on security issues. He said his delegation had been invited by the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
He was joined at the news conference by Dr. Siegfried Hecker, an expert on nuclear weapons and a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Professor Lewis said two senior staff aides to members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee had also accompanied the delegation to Yongbyon.
He said the North Korean government had allowed the delegation to interview a range of scientific, military and economic officials and had granted all requests it made for the trip.
