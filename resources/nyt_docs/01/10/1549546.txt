To the Editor:
I live on the border between downtown Brooklyn and Boerum Hill, directly across the street from the area of proposed development described in ''Plugging a Hole in Brooklyn's Heart'' (news article, Jan. 7). I've never thought of the view from my front door as ''eight square blocks of urban blight.''
Instead, I've enjoyed looking at sky, open space and, until it was recently razed to accommodate the proposed development, the beautiful community garden known as the Little Botanic Garden.
You quote Jo Ann Simon, a past president of the Boerum Hill Association, as asking, ''What are you going to do to create open space, realistically, that people can use?''
There is a great need in this neighborhood for a park that is open to the public. We already have lots of shops, offices and residents, and will soon have many more, but the one thing we don't have is a place for all these people to come together.
With all this development, surely some little parcel of land could be set aside as green space for the use of the community.
