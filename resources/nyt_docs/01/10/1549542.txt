To the Editor:
Re ''9 Soldiers Dead in Crash in Iraq'' (front page, Jan. 9):
With deadly attacks against United States troops continuing in the Sunni Triangle in Iraq, the American command should impose martial law there until the hostilities come to an end.
It appears that the Shiite population is in no hurry to help. To the contrary, the Shiites appear also to prefer that United States forces leave the country.
What better way to have this occur than to have their Sunni counterparts pull the trigger and incur the blame for American casualties?
Since time has shown that the United States has no real friends or allies among the Iraqis, and American casualties continue to mount, imposition of martial law would be appropriate, and the Iraqis, Sunni and Shiite, could determine when martial law is lifted -- when the attacks against United States troops cease.
This should become the first step of self-determination and cooperation among Iraqis.
