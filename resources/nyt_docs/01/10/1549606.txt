Because of an editing error, a report in the Boldface Names column yesterday about the release of Barbara Corcoran's book ''If You Don't Have Big Breasts, Put Ribbons in Your Pigtails'' misstated her involvement with the Corcoran Group, which she founded and later sold. She remains chairwoman; she has not left the business.
