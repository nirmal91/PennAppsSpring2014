India's second-largest exporter of software services, Infosys Technologies, said it earned 3.28 billion rupees ($72 million) in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, an increase of 28 percent over the year-earlier period. Infosys, a bellwether for software services companies in the country, has gained from outsourcing by companies in the United States and Europe that are trying to reduce expenses. More than 70 percent of the company's revenue comes from corporations based in the United States. The company added 30 clients and hired 3,666 people during the quarter.
