Indonesia's benchmark stock index rose 3.13 percent yesterday to a record amid growing optimism about the country's economic outlook this year. Analysts said the absence of new terrorist attacks over the year-end holidays, higher oil prices, low inflation and falling interest rates had buoyed hopes that Indonesia's economic growth would accelerate this year. Fears that parliamentary and presidential elections this year might lead to fresh instability have abated, and foreign investors were net buyers of about $50 million in Indonesian stocks in the first week, according to statistics compiled by Nomura International in Hong Kong.
