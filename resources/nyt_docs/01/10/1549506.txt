Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg decided yesterday to postpone a visit to Haiti planned for tomorrow, after reports of increasing political and civil unrest there, the mayor's aides said.
Mr. Bloomberg had planned to fly in his private jet to Port-au-Prince and to spend the morning commemorating Haiti's bicentennial with a round of public events. He was scheduled to speak at a church, visit patients at an AIDS clinic, and have lunch with business and community leaders before proceeding to Kingston, Jamaica, in the afternoon.
Mr. Bloomberg will now travel directly to Jamaica tomorrow and return to New York City in the evening, his aides said.
Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, cited concerns about the unrest in Haiti following President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's failure to reach agreement with his political rivals. In recent weeks, mass demonstrations against President Aristide have paralyzed the government.
''In light of recent conflict in Haiti as well as the recommendations from the State Department, specifically the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the mayor has decided to postpone his trip to the country,'' Mr. Skyler said yesterday.
But Mr. Skyler added that the mayor still planned to visit Haiti this year and would hold a reception at Gracie Mansion next week in honor of Haiti's bicentennial. Mr. Bloomberg, who is seeking re-election in 2005, is widely seen to be courting support among immigrants.
In Jamaica, the mayor plans to visit a children's hospital, meet with local political officials and attend a dinner with small-business leaders, his aides said.
