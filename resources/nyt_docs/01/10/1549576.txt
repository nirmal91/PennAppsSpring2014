A Staten Island man was beaten to death in a bar in the Bronx early yesterday, the police said.
The man, Charles Mannino, 46, died from what the police said was ''blunt trauma'' at the bar, J-Lana's Lounge at 156 West 231st Street in Kingsbridge. Officers said that the beating occurred at 7 a.m. The attacker fled.
A manager of another bar in the neighborhood said he believed that Mr. Mannino had been beaten to death with a pool stick. The manager, Robert Sutliff, said that Mr. Mannino had worked for years at J-Lana's, cleaning it after closing time.
''It's upsetting,'' said Mr. Sutliff, who said he has been a manager at at the Piper's Kilt Tavern, half a block west of J-Lana's, for nine years. Still, he said ''it can happen anywhere.''
The police did not say whether Mr. Mannino had been working at J-Lana's or was there as a customer. They said only that he lived at 85 Boyd Street in the Stapleton section of Staten Island.
J-Lana's shares a modest one-story building with a law firm and a company that trains security guards.
Mr. Sutliff said that the two other bars in the area have had their share of fights, but never murders.
The killing shocked other neighbors on the block. Mary Muldoon, 62, who has lived in area her entire life, said she could not recall any crime so violent having taken place in the area.
''This is terrible,'' she said. The bar ''used to be on the rowdy side, but in the last few years it's been a very nice sociable place.''
J-Lana's Lounge remained closed yesterday evening. Chairs had been placed on top of tables and its widows were dark.
