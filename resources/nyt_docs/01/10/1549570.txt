The police have arrested a Ukrainian man suspected of selling weapons to the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the authorities reported. The man was arrested in Berlin last month on an international warrant. He allegedly provided 10,000 Kalashnikov rifles to the rebel group, Colombia's largest.
