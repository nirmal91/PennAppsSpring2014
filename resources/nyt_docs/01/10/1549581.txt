The United States government put South Korea on its priority watch list, saying it had failed to stanch the growth of online piracy of music and motion pictures, according to the office of the United States trade representative. Officials said sanctions would be imposed if South Korea did not provide better protection of intellectual property rights. The United States industry estimates that it lost $572 million in 2002 as a result of piracy in South Korea.
