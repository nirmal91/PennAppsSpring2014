To the Editor:
''Indonesia's Secret War'' (editorial, Jan. 3) is right about the need to persuade the Acehnese to negotiate an agreement to remain as part of Indonesia. But what you call a secret war is not covert. The government publicly announced this policy on May 19, 2003, with the overwhelming support of Parliament, after exhausting peaceful means. What is occurring in Aceh is not a war but an operation against an armed insurgency, the Free Aceh Movement, that uses terror and intimidation.
Indonesia has every right under international law to preserve its territorial integrity. Like any sensible government, it will never succumb to terrorist pressure, for once that happens, the peaceful avenue for a lasting solution is lost.
It must be noted that Indonesia has allowed groups like Unicef and Unesco to resume operations in Aceh. Representatives of America's embassy have also been allowed in.
