To the Editor:
Re ''Powell Admits No Hard Proof in Linking Iraq to Al Qaeda'' (news article, Jan. 9):
It is sad watching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell scrambling to justify the Bush administration's attack on Iraq in what has turned out to be an erroneous premise.
It is even sadder that so large a part of the American public still believes what isn't true, or just doesn't care, and that the Bush administration does nothing to disabuse it of its belief.
Among the many casualties of our misguided policy on Iraq is the credibility of our government.
That hurts us throughout the world and is anathema to our democratic process.
