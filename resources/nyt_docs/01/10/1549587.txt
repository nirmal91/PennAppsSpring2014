Gen. Wesley K. Clark asserted that the federal government had not done all it could to thwart either the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or future such attacks, and that terrorism in this country was not inevitable. ''I think that it's clear that more could have been done to prevent 9/11 than was done,'' General Clark said Friday, speaking to reporters in Lebanon, N.H. He was quoted in Friday's Concord Monitor as saying that ''the two greatest lies'' of the last two years were that the Sept. 11 attacks could not have been prevented and that more attacks were inevitable. He said the fact that the nation's terrorist threat status had been put at ''high'' over the Christmas holidays indicated that President Bush had erred in invading Iraq before Osama bin Laden was captured and his terror network dismantled.
