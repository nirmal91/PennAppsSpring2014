To the Editor:
Following on the heels of your report about scientific findings of the potential relationship between global warming and the extinction of countless species within the next 50 years (news article, Jan. 8), we read about the president's proposed new initiative to send humans to Mars (front page, Jan. 9). The need for a major research and development effort to address the devastating impact of climate change surely must take precedence over adventures in outer space.
