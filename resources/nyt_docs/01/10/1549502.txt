The police arrested eight foreign nationals suspected of involvement in suicide bomb attacks in May in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that killed 35 people, including a Swiss citizen, Swiss authorities said Friday.
The suspects were arrested Thursday in the cantons of Geneva, Zurich, Bern, Aarau and Vaud, the federal prosecutor's office in Bern said. Officials there said the arrests were the result of an investigation begun shortly after the attacks, and that the suspects were thought to have provided ''logistical support to a criminal organization.''
Federal and local police officers took part in the sweep.
