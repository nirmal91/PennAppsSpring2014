The Jets hired Denny Marcin yesterday to be their defensive line coach, a position he previously held for seven seasons with the Giants, but the search for a defensive coordinator will go into a third week.
The Jets will again seek permission from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to speak to their defensive line coach, Rod Marinelli.
The Jets have received permission to speak with the Eagles assistant Ron Rivera and the Chiefs assistant Gunther Cunningham, but if their teams win playoff games this weekend, they will remain unavailable for interviews next week.
The Jets have also interviewed the former Giants defensive coordinator Johnnie Lynn, who could also be a candidate to be the secondary coach.
Under Marcin, the Giants averaged 44.6 sacks per season and allowed an average of 102.3 rushing yards a game.
