N.F.C. DIVISIONAL PLAYOFF
4:30 p.m., Fox  Carolina Panthers (12-5) at St. Louis Rams (12-4)
The book on defeating the Rams at the Edward Jones Dome is easy to write but difficult to execute. Hit them in the mouth, one chapter will say. Stop Marshall Faulk, another will offer. Since 2002, the Rams have welcomed 14 visitors to their turf and sent each one home with a defeat.
What makes the Panthers an intriguing opponent is their combination of youth, power and speed along their front four. The line of scrimmage will determine who wins this game.
Then there is this. John Fox, the Panthers' coach, faced the Rams for three consecutive seasons between 1999 and 2001 as the Giants' defensive coordinator. Though the Giants went 0-3 in that stretch, the games were closer with each meeting, including the Rams' 15-14 victory in St. Louis in 2001, a brutally physical game in which the Giants held the Rams to one touchdown and knocked quarterback Kurt Warner out of the game.
If the Panthers are able to knock around quarterback Marc Bulger, who is making his first start in the postseason, the exquisite timing of the Rams' offense may become herky-jerky.
But Carolina will have to choose its moments to blitz. Faulk, who has unmatched quickness and vision, can make a defense look foolish if it is too aggressive. The last time the Rams and Panthers met, on Dec. 23, 2001, in Charlotte, Faulk rushed for 202 yards and added 50 more receiving -- the kind of numbers that keep winning streaks alive.
