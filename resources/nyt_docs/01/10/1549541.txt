To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Withdraws a Team of Weapons Hunters From Iraq, Saying That Its Work Is Done'' (news article, Jan. 8):
With Saddam Hussein in American custody, weapons inspectors should have full access to Iraqi scientists and Iraqi weapons sites.
If there are banned weapons in Iraq, now is the time to search for them. Right? Then why is the Bush administration pulling out a 400-member team?
After all, it was only 11 months ago that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the United Nations that ''there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons'' and ''our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical-weapons agent.''
When will the Bush administration concede that the justification for the Iraq war was based on false information -- either faulty intelligence or, worse, fabricated intelligence?
