Gov. Donald L. Carcieri is creating an independent panel to investigate corruption in state government. The announcement comes as the state attorney general and state police are investigating legislators' business dealings and work they have done as consultants. Mr. Carcieri, a Republican, said the panel would have subpoena power and conduct public hearings. Some Republican leaders of the Legislature, meanwhile, are asking that Attorney General Patrick Lynch recuse himself from the investigation because he lobbied for one of the companies being investigated while in private practice. Mr. Lynch said he had no intention of stepping aside.
