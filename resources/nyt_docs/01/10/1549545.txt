To the Editor:
According to ''Blue Blood at the Gas Pumps: Queens Families Still Have Their Legacy, if Not Their Land'' (news article, Jan. 3), ''some New Yorkers'' view the borough as ''a sprawl of highways and airports, where legions of newly arrived immigrants live in cramped high-rise apartments alongside ugly suburban tract houses.''
This may ring true for some who are passing through on their way from here to there. But you need to get off the highway to discover the beauty.
The borough is, of course, one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the country, a place where immigrants' dreams become reality even while they are crammed into those ugly buildings, but there is more. There are parks with forests and tree-lined streets. There are beaches, and harbors, and views of Manhattan that can take your breath away.
Be careful, though. If you get off the highway, you may put down roots and start another line of aristocrats whose lineage may be marveled at in The New York Times 200 years from now.
