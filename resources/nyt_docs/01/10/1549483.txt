Four Pakistani soldiers were killed and seven wounded when an army camp in a semiautonomous tribal region came under rocket attack Thursday night, military officials said Friday.
American and Pakistani officials believe that members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban are using the mountainous areas to mount attacks on American forces in Afghanistan. Pakistan has sent 70,000 troops -- the army's first deployment in the tribal areas -- in an effort to apprehend them.
The rocket attack on Thursday on a base at Wana, in South Waziristan, occurred after the Pakistan Army and paramilitary troops ended a search operation in Kalusha, a village eight miles west of Wana. The operation was aimed at the capture of two tribesmen believed to be sheltering and aiding Taliban and Al Qaeda members, officials said, but added that the tribesmen had left the area several days before.
Eight Pakistani soldiers were killed in the area in October in an encounter that left 18 Al Qaeda suspects dead; 10 soldiers were killed there in June 2002.
Wana is 25 miles from the border and near Paktika Province in Afghanistan, where an American military base at Shikin has frequently come under attack. American military officials say the attackers retreat into the neighboring Pakistani tribal area.
