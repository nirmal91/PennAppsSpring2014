Germany's largest department store operator, KarstadtQuelle, said that sales for the fourth quarter of 2003 fell 6.8 percent, to 4.5 billion euros ($5.75 billion), because of weak holiday season sales and the general reluctance of German consumers to spend. According to provisional figures for the 2003 financial year, the group had sales of 15.3 billion euros ($19.5 billion), a decline of 3.5 percent from the previous year. Still, the company reported continued growth in its online business and said that it was able to expand its market position in Germany. Online revenue increased 28 percent, to 1.59 billion euros ($2.03 billion).
