Howard Dean criticized President Bush on Friday for saying Christianity had influenced his opposition to stem-cell research.
''I think we ought to make scientific decisions, not theological and theoretical decisions,'' Dr. Dean said at a town-hall-style meeting in Rochester, N.H.
Dr. Dean made the statement three days after saying that his own religion had guided him in supporting civil unions for gays while governor of Vermont.
He said the difference between his action and Mr. Bush's was in their effects on people.
''I would differentiate it from my support of civil unions.'' he told reporters in the afternoon, ''because I didn't deprive anybody of anything by supporting civil unions. That was really a choice that had to do with, many people would say, morality or ethics. That's a different thing, I think, than applying your religious beliefs, with the result of depriving people really, literally, in some cases, a very long disease-free life as opposed to one that has significant complications.''
While Dr. Dean has previously said religion had no role in public policy, he has lately been trying to incorporate God into his presidential campaign, particularly in the South. He also told reporters this week that religion helped sway his view of civil unions because he believed that ''the hallmark of a Christian is to reach out to people who have been left behind.''
At a student convention here on Friday, a student challenged Dr. Dean on his promise to talk more about religion while campaigning in the South but not in his native North. Dr. Dean replied, ''I decided to talk about God every place, if they want me to.''
Another student said he had two questions and wanted straight answers. Was Dr. Dean a Christian, he asked, and the candidate replied, ''Yup.''
The student then asked whether Dr. Dean believed that ''the heavenly father created homosexual people.'' And Dr. Dean repeated, ''Yup.''
