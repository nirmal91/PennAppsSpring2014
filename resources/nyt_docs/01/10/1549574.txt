In a rare victory for a citizens group in Asia, Hong Kong's highest court ruled that the government had failed to meet legal criteria for filling in part of the territory's famed Victoria Harbor and must show an ''overriding public need'' for the project. The ruling by the Court of Final Appeal blocked the government -- at least temporarily -- from further land reclamation work to fill in a swath of the harbor for a covered highway. The government said it would review its plans and believed it could yet meet requirements imposed by the court.
