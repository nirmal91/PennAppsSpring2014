To the Editor:
Re ''9 Soldiers Dead in Crash in Iraq'' (front page, Jan. 9):
With all the daily reports of United States casualties in Iraq, are Americans no longer complaining, or have we become uncaring? Have we given up and simply accepted the fact that the administration has America in a trance?
The numbers of American dead mount and climb to more than 300; our allies are convinced that we are insane; and the war on terrorism is not only a failure, but it has also stripped Americans of some of their freedom.
A rise in the stock market does not indicate a vibrant economy.
Have Americans lost their voices? Are we resigned to accept the unacceptable?
Who are we now?
