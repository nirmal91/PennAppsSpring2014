Libya agreed Friday to pay $170 million to the families of victims killed in the terrorist bombing of a French airliner over Africa in 1989, clearing one of the last hurdles in its campaign to rehabilitate its image in the West.
In addition to the agreement on Friday, Libya declared last month that it would dismantle its nuclear weapons program, which it had pursued clandestinely, and invite international weapons inspectors to verify the process.
The deal, which will provide $1 million for each of the 170 people killed in the attack, brings to a close two years of contentious negotiations that at one point threatened to derail a British-led effort to lift United Nations economic sanctions against the North African country.
''Libya must be reintegrated into the international community,'' said the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, at a news conference with his Libyan counterpart, Abdel Rahman Shalgam, that was attended by representatives of the victims' families. ''All our relations will benefit from a new dynamism after today,'' he added.
Under the agreement, Libya's Qaddafi Foundation, run by a son of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, will pay the $170 million in four installments. It handed over a check for the equivalent of $42.5 million at Friday's signing.
Libya had already paid France $34 million in 1999 as compensation for the terrorist attack, which killed people from 17 countries, including 54 from France, when a bomb destroyed a DC-10 over the Ténéré desert on its way to Paris from Brazzaville, Congo.
The airplane was operated by the French carrier U.T.A., which has since been bought by the country's national carrier, Air France. The payment was made after a Paris court convicted six Libyans in absentia for the attack.
