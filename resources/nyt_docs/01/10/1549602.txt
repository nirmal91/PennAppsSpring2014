A federal appeals court panel denied a request from Susan H. McDougal to have the government pay her legal bills related to a special counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton. The panel, three judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, said the government did not have to pay the more than $300,000 in fees. Mrs. McDougal was acquitted of obstructing justice after she refused to testify before a grand jury about the Arkansas financial dealings of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
