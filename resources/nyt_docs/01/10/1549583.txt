Employment in Canada rose in December for the fourth consecutive month, pushing the jobless rate down to 7.4 percent from 7.5 percent in November, Statistics Canada reported. The jobs data, which was stronger than analysts had expected, helped lift the Canadian dollar to slightly more than 78 United States cents, its highest level in more than a decade. Analysts are divided on whether the Bank of Canada will seek to keep the currency in check by lowering interest rates at its next review of monetary policy on Jan. 20.
