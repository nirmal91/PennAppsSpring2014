Two veterans of former Vice President Al Gore's political team have joined the campaign of Howard Dean, a month after their former boss endorsed him. Leon Fuerth, Mr. Gore's national security adviser for eight years and now a member of the faculty at George Washington University, will head Dr. Dean's group of foreign policy advisers. Roy Neel, who spent 17 years working for Mr. Gore in the Senate and then the vice president's office before becoming a deputy chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, has been named a senior adviser to Dr. Dean without a particular portfolio.
