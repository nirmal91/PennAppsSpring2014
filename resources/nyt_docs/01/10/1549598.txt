Texas A&amp;M University will immediately end its legacy program, under which the children of alumni got preference in admissions. The university president, Robert M. Gates, who said he had consulted the A&amp;M trustees, declared the program inconsistent with the university's policy of merit-based enrollment. Black and Hispanic political organizations had threatened to sue unless A&amp;M ended the program.
