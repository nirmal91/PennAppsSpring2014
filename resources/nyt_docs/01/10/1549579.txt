Interest rates on savings deposits are approaching zero as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pumps money into banks in an effort to prevent the Hong Kong dollar from appreciating against the American dollar. HSBC, the Chinese territory's dominant bank, said that it was lowering the interest rate it would pay on savings deposits of at least $1,300 to one-thousandth of 1 percent from the previous rate of one-hundredth of 1 percent. The bank left its main lending rate at 5 percent.
