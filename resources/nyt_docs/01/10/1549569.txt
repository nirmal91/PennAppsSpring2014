The government announced that parliamentary elections would be held March 28, replacing the Parliament whose flawed election in November touched off the protests that ousted Eduard A. Shevardnadze from the presidency. The new president, Mikhail Saakashvilli, elected Sunday, will be inaugurated Jan. 25. In the meantime, the current Parliament continues to meet, but often without a quorum and with questionable legitimacy to enact any laws proposed by Mr. Saakashvili.
