The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it was being formally investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accusations levied against the company last year in a wrongful termination lawsuit.
The investigation stems from a $44.4 million lawsuit filed in May by Matthew Whitley, a former finance director in Coke's fountain unit who accused Coke of committing $2 billion in accounting fraud, discriminating against minorities and women and manipulating inventories.
Mr. Whitley also accused the company of participating in a marketing scheme in which Coke paid $10,000 to order value meals for hundreds of children in Richmond, Va. In doing so, the lawsuit asserted, the company hoped to make Frozen Cokes -- slushy drinks that came with meals at Burger King restaurants -- seem more popular than they actually were and force a national rolloutt.
In June, executives at Coke acknowledged that the company had rigged the marketing test for Frozen Coke. At that time, the company disclosed that the S.E.C. had issued an informal request for documents regarding Mr. Whitley's assertions.
Executives at Coke said that they were informed of the commission's latest move yesterday. ''The company will continue to cooperate fully with the S.E.C.'s investigation,'' the company said. The S.E.C. did not return repeated calls for comment.
Mr. Whitley, whom executives at Coke described as a ''disgruntled employee,'' contended in the lawsuit that he was fired after he raised accusations of impropriety at the company.
Coke executives said he was terminated in March as part of a reorganization. The parties reached a $540,000 settlement in October.
