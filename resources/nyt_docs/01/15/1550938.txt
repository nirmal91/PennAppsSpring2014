After more than 20 years on the run, Rita Algranati, 46, convicted in absentia in Italy for taking part in the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades guerrilla group, is under arrest in Rome, the police said. The Italian and Egyptian police seized Ms. Algranati and a fellow fugitive, Maurizio Falessi, at Cairo Airport on Tuesday. An Italian court sentenced Ms. Algranati to life imprisonment in 1993. Mr. Falessi, 50, was convicted in absentia in 1989 and sentenced to 11 years for the attempted murder of a politician. The far-left Brigades terrorized Italy in the 1970's and early 80's.
