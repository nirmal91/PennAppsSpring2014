Japan's current account surplus grew 34 percent in November from the month a year ago, the fifth straight increase. The surplus hit 1.5 trillion yen ($14.1 billion) as imports slowed 5.4 percent. Exports also fell, but only by 1.8 percent, partly because of the rising value of the yen. Japan's deficit in services also shrank as fewer Japanese tourists traveled overseas. The current account is the broadest measure of goods, services, tourism and investment going in and out of the country.
