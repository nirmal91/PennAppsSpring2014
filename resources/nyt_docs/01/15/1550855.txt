The top health official in the Pentagon said there were at least 21 suicides last year among troops serving in Iraq.
The official, Dr. William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said 18 of the deaths were Army soldiers. He said the rate was a slight increase over past years.
Dr. Winkenwerder said the figures reflected a suicide rate for soldiers in Iraq of about 13.5 per 100,000. In 2001, the overall suicide rate in the United States was about 11 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
