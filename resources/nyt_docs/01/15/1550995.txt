Pete Rose's autobiography, in which he admitted to gambling on baseball, will be the No. 1 book on The New York Times's nonfiction best-seller list on Jan. 25, topping Michael Moore's ''Dude, Where's My Country.''
The book, ''My Prison Without Bars'' (Rodale Press), went on sale last Thursday and about 21,000 were sold through Saturday, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks industry sales. An estimated 6,000 have been sold by Barnes &amp; Noble, an industry executive said.
A fundamental test for a newsmaking book published amid a wave of exposure from the news media is how resilient its sales are when the publicity dies down.
Walter Boyer, owner of Bookends, in Ridgewood, N.J., said he sold about 1,400 copies during a signing by Rose last Thursday. But since then, he said, sales have been ''pretty slow, maybe a couple of dozen.''
At Barnes &amp; Noble, Rose's book ranked No. 5 on its nonfiction best-seller list last week and this week ranks in the top 10. ''It's doing well, but it's leveling off,'' said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for the chain.
