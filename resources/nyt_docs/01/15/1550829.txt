Clock radios offer plenty of early morning news, weather and traffic reports, but they dole them out on their own schedules and interrupt them with commercials. The Web, of course, supplies an abundance of information on demand. Most people do not have bedside computers, however, or the inclination to use them when they first wake up.
But the iClock from Personica Intelligence will allow users to summon information to their bedrooms from the Internet by using voice commands. ''We offer a hands-free experience when you probably want it the most,'' said Brian Mahony, a Personica marketing executive.
The iClock resembles a high-end clock radio with the addition of a liquid crystal display about the size of a palmtop computer. To work, it must be connected to a computer network -- wired or wireless -- with a computer switched on.
When a user requests, say, the local weather, the iClock will consult the computer and download the information from a Web site -- probably Yahoo, Mr. Mahony said -- and utter it aloud in synthesized speech while displaying it on the screen. Users will also be able to summon music stored on a computer.
Many details about the iClock, which was introduced last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, are not yet final. But Mr. Mahony said he expected it to appear on store shelves by the end of the year and to sell for $150 to $200, depending on the features.
While Mr. Mahony said Personica was happy with the iClock name, even that may have to change. An unrelated company already uses it for a software-based clock interface for computer operating systems.
