President Bush's peace envoy for Sudan, former Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, met with Sudanese government officials and rebel leaders to pressure the two sides to sign a peace deal before Mr. Bush's State of the Union address next week. The talks, intended to end Africa's longest-running civil war, are taking place at Lake Naivasha in Kenya. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had urged the parties last month to reach a deal by the end of 2003, but a variety of sticking points have delayed a resolution.
