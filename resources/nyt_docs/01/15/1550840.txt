Most people will not get the chance to control Spirit, the robotic rover on the surface of Mars. But a new Web venture offers armchair astronomers a consolation prize: the opportunity to control an earthbound telescope to view Mars and other heavenly objects.
There are other interactive robotic telescope sites on the Web, but the new site, Slooh.com, is described by its founder, Michael Paolucci, as an attempt to ''consumerize the experience'' of astronomy.
For a $49 yearly fee, users get unlimited viewing during what the company calls ''group missions'' and one 15-minute private session to point the telescope at a favorite object. A $99 membership increases the solo time to 90 minutes, and members at either level can purchase additional 15-minute segments for $19.95.
Slooh.com's telescopes, which Mr. Paolucci described as ''top-of-the-line consumer equipment,'' are in the Canary Islands, off the coast of North Africa. Viewing hours (weather permitting, of course) are from 2 p.m. to midnight Eastern time. That may be Slooh.com's best feature -- the chance to view the night sky when it's still light outside.
