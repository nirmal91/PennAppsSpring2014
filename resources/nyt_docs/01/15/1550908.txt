Re ''Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Marriage'' (front page, Jan. 14):
The money would be better spent on a universal health care plan for all Americans.
You can't save a marriage without help for the heart, body and mind first. I find it appalling that many American families can't afford to take their children for a regular checkup, but with this proposal they will be able to get training in marriage skills, all to please the religious right and its agenda.
Let's get our priorities straight.
