To the Editor:
The Bush administration should be applauded for its consideration of a program intended to strengthen marriage (''Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Marriage,'' front page, Jan. 14).
Having been married to the same woman for nearly 40 years, I appreciate the benefits that an enduring relationship can provide.
While the effectiveness of the suggested program cannot be assured, it makes infinitely more sense than complaints that the beleaguered institution of marriage would somehow be undermined by permitting same-sex unions.
Indeed, such a program would serve a useful purpose if it merely gave the administration the political courage to avoid the unwise proposal of a constitutional amendment to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.
Such an amendment would have little chance of passage and would be seen as a transparently cynical sop to the religious right.
