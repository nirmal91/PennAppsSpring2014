The police said yesterday that a mate on the Staten Island ferry had told his bosses he saw a man who resembled the theatrical monologist Spalding Gray aboard a ferry boat on Friday, one day before Mr. Gray was last seen in Manhattan and two days before his wife reported him missing.
A police spokesman, Lt. Brian Burke, said detectives had not yet interviewed the ferry mate, Billy Doyle. For that reason, Lieutenant Burke said, ''We have no confirmed sighting'' of Mr. Gray.
He also said that there had been no reports that anyone had jumped from a ferry over the weekend.
The police said they were pursuing possible leads about Mr. Gray from calls they had received as word spread that he was missing. Mr. Gray, 62, was last seen on Saturday night after seeing the movie ''Big Fish'' and telling his family that he was going to see friends.
He left his wallet and credit cards in his SoHo apartment, along with his suitcase, which was packed for a ski trip to Colorado that was to begin the next morning. But he never checked in for the flight at LaGuardia Airport.
A family friend, Sara Vass, said yesterday that Mr. Gray's wife had given him the trip to a ski clinic in Aspen, Colo., as a present -- he had been a passionate skier before an automobile accident in Ireland in 2001 left him with serious hip and head injuries. He has undergone a number of operations since then and battled depression, Ms. Vass said.
