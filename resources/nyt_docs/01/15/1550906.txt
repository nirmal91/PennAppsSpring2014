To the Editor:
According to a Jan. 14 front-page article, the Bush administration plans to spend $1.5 billion on a ''healthy marriage'' program for low-income people. It will be voluntary and will teach conflict management and marriage skills, publicize the value of marriage, and use married couples as role models.
I wonder: if program participants marry and after a while divorce, will taxpayers get their money back?
