Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg questioned this week why the City Council would spend $15,000 to hire a private company to investigate sexual harassment charges against a councilman, saying the city has a Department of Investigation for that.
Now, shoe planted on other foot, some council members are questioning why the Department of Investigation wants to spend $196,560 to hire a private consultant to help investigate the city's Buildings Department for two years.
The Department of Investigation wants to hire Dennis Curran, who stepped down as the Building Department's inspector general in 2002, as a private consultant to evaluate all pending cases and suggest ways to strengthen them.
The proposed hiring raised eyebrows among some council members who were stung by the mayor's remarks about their decision to hire an outside company to assist in the investigation of sexual harassment charges against Councilman Allan W. Jennings Jr. of Queens.
''Whether it's hypocrisy, shameless politics or an honest mistake, I don't know, but the mayor should explain,'' said Councilman Eric Gioia of Queens, chairman of the oversight and investigations committee.
Emily Gest, a Department of Investigation spokeswoman, said that the city was working to root out corruption at the Buildings Department, and that it turned to Mr. Curran after soliciting bids from 45 contractors.
An aide to Mr. Bloomberg said he thought that there was no analogy between the Council's decision to hire an outside company to perform a function that the city does, and the department's decision to hire a contractor to help it handle its primary function. ''It's apples and oranges,'' the aide said.
