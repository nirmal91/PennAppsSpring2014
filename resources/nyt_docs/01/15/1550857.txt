An article last Thursday about Paul Heinegg, a genealogist who researches mixed-race American families, referred incompletely to Alexander Hamilton and his mother, who were cited as historical examples. While there have been suggestions that the mother, Rachel Faucett or Fawcett -- and therefore Hamilton himself -- was of mixed ancestry, it is not an established fact. (She was born in the British West Indies, the daughter of a French Huguenot father; her mother's ancestry is open to speculation.)
