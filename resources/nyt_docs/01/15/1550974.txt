A Pennsylvania company said it had recalled nearly 400,000 toy bumblebees that attach to high chairs because antennae on them have broken off, federal officials said. The manufacturer, Graco Children's Products of Exton, Pa., said it had reports of 26 cases of the antennae breaking off; five involved children who began to choke on the fragments. The recall includes all toy bumblebees with a blue antenna. The company said that the toys should be discarded and that it would provide refunds. Consumers may call Graco at (800) 258-3213.
