KB Toys, the nation's fourth-largest toy retailer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday, citing holiday-season price wars for its continuing losses. The company, which is privately held and is based in Pittsfield, Mass., said it had secured $350 million worth of financing from the Fleet Retail Group for its Chapter 11 reorganization. KB Toys has more than 1,200 retail stores nationwide. It plans to close roughly 400 to 500 stores. The company said it would continue to pay its 13,000 employees salaries and benefits and its vendors and suppliers while it reorganizes. According to a filing made in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, the toy maker Hasbro was listed as KB Toys' biggest unsecured creditor. KB Toys said that it hoped to emerge from bankruptcy protection before the holiday season at the end of this year.
