Floris Schoonderbeek, a Dutch designer, says his plastic outdoor hot tub, right, looks like a cannibal's kettle. Called the Dutchtub, it requires no electricity, plumbing or hot water. Just fill it with a garden hose or a pail, put firewood in the bin, light it up, wait a while and enjoy a 100-degree soak with natural eddies.
Mr. Schoonderbeek says the Dutchtub, which weighs 165 pounds, is a ''new way of outdoor bathing.'' It will fit in the back of an S.U.V. and can be used at a campsite or even on a sturdy roof. The designer plans to take one to the Alps this winter and fill it with snow. Made of plastic and steel, the tub is available in a range of colors. It is $4,800 plus shipping ($750 to $1,000 to the United States); www.dutchtub.nl, or 011-31-620-708-532.
