Re ''Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Marriage'' (front page, Jan. 14):
President Bush plans to spend $1.5 billion to promote marriage by providing low-income couples with training in interpersonal relations. But this money might be better spent by reducing the key cause of domestic strife: the limited economic opportunities for working families.
Increasing numbers of the working poor do not earn a living wage. More families are strained by the pressures of having two wage earners working at least full time.
And more workers need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
Strong marriages require that workers have livable incomes, economic security and sufficient leisure time to build the strong interpersonal relationships that families require.
