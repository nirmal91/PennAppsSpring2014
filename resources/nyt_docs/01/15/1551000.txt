The Huntington Free Library and Reading Room, a fixture on Westchester Square for more than a century, has won a court fight that it says should allow it to remain open and become a community center. The library has been in a 15-year battle over its rare books and manuscripts about American Indians, which began when the Smithsonian Institution laid claim to the collection. In recent years, the library has said it cannot afford to care for the items. The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled last week that the library could receive $2.5 million for turning the collection over to Cornell University or the New York State Historical Association.
