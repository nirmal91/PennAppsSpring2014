Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, said it was contesting a claim for back taxes and fines of 98 billion rubles, or $3.4 billion, made last month by the Russian government. Yukos said that the tax bill, the equivalent of 98 billion rubles, was unconstitutional, and that the company had formally demanded Russia's Tax Ministry withdraw its claim. Yukos called the tax bill ''blackmail on the part of tax authorities trying to create a false threat of bankruptcy around the company and to openly pressure its shareholders, creditors, employees and partners.'' The Tax Ministry said last month that Yukos owed more than 98 billion rubles in taxes and fines, contending that the oil producer unlawfully avoided the taxes by setting up illegal tax shelters.
