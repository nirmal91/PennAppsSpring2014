Guy V. Molinari, the former Staten Island borough president, yesterday threatened to support a challenger to Representative Vito J. Fossella, left, this year if Mr. Fossella did not stop flirting with the idea of running against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2005. Mr. Fossella, a Republican who represents Staten Island in the House, has said he has no political plans other than to run for re-election. But he has acknowledged that party officials have approached him about running in a primary against Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Molinari, also a Republican, said Mr. Fossella was harming Mr. Bloomberg's re-election prospects. But contrary to a report in The Staten Island Advance, Mr. Molinari said he was not considering a run against Mr. Fossella himself. Craig Donner, a spokesman for Mr. Fossella, said, ''I find his statements truly bizarre, and we don't have a clue where it's coming from.''
