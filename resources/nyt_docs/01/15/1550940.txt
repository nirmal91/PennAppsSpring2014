Pride of America, which is to be the first new oceangoing ship in 50 years to fly the United States flag, took on water and tilted in a storm in Bremerhaven on the North Sea, where it is under final construction. It was listing by about 15 degrees to starboard. Three workers were injured. The authorities were investigating the accident, and the shipbuilder said it was too soon to assess the damage.
