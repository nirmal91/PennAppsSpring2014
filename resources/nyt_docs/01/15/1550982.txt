An article yesterday about tensions between the Bush administration and leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico, gave an incomplete name for the Jamaican leader and misstated his title. He is Percival James Patterson, not James. (He commonly uses the name P. J. Patterson.) He is prime minister, not president.
