To the Editor:
Re ''To Avoid Fuel Limits, Subaru Is Turning a Sedan Into a Truck'' (front page, Jan. 13):
Subaru understands that to compete in the American marketplace, it must make a less efficient model of its sedan.
Perhaps it is time that we, as Americans, rethink what our policies are leading to. Let's eliminate the distinction between cars and light trucks and require all passenger vehicles to adhere to the same standard.
Our regulations today give the rich, who can afford S.U.V.'s, the opportunity to flaunt their wealth with dangerous tinted windows and environmentally hazardous exhausts. Let's hold them to the same standard that we hold everyone else.
