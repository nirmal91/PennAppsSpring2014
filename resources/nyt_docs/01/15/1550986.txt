A front-page article on Friday about the investigation of an abuse complaint against a counselor at the academy of the Boys Choir of Harlem referred imprecisely to the routing of a letter about the case by Lisa M. Friel, chief sex crimes investigator for the Manhattan district attorney's office. It was addressed to Richard Condon, special commissioner of investigations for the New York City School District, who forwarded it to the choir's board with his memorandum about the case. Ms. Friel did not send it directly to the board.
