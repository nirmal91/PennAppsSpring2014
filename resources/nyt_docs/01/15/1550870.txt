To the Editor:
Re ''Megadollar Homes, Megapainful Headaches'' (Jan. 8). It made me grateful to have bought a simple 1920's home with four bedrooms with front and back yards on a tree-lined street in Stapleton, Staten Island, four years ago. The price: $135,000.
Sure, it needs work, but it is a roomy, sunny, cozy, warm place. And I have a view of the bay and the passing boats and money left each month to spend on enjoying the city.
Coming from my native Belgium, I'm glad there's life, creativity, energy and opportunity outside Manhattan.
