An article yesterday about the closing of the Broadway musical ''Taboo'' next month referred incorrectly to countersuits by Rosie O'Donnell, ''Taboo's'' producer, and Gruner &amp; Jahr USA, which published Rosie magazine. While Justice Ira Gammerman of New York State Supreme Court has suggested that neither side will be awarded significant damages, he has not dismissed the suits.
