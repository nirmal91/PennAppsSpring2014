Canada's foreign trade surplus shrank in November for the second consecutive month, increasing the likelihood, analysts said, that the Bank of Canada would lower interest rates at its next review of monetary policy on January 20. Statistics Canada reported that the surplus fell to 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.4 billion) from 5.1 billion Canadian dollars in October. The agency ascribed a 1.1 percent drop in exports chiefly to the strengthening Canadian dollar and unsettled demand from the United States, by far Canada's biggest foreign market.
