MANHATTAN real estate brokerage firms are in a buying mood. Terra Holdings, the owner of the white-shoe real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens, is to announce today that it is taking a 55 percent stake in Dunemere Associates Real Estate, a leading brokerage firm on the East End of Long Island. The expanded firm will be called Brown Harris Stevens, dropping the Dunemere name.
Brown Harris, which already has two offices in Palm Beach, Fla., believes many clients will use the firm to buy a Park Avenue junior six, find the perfect Southampton home, with pool, and sell that ocean-to-lake estate in Palm Beach.
Arthur W. Zeckendorf, a chairman of Terra Holdings, said the company first approached Dunemere about five years ago, but the timing was not right. Talks resumed last fall.
Terra Holdings may be playing catch-up with its biggest rivals in Manhattan. Last fall, NRT Inc., the parent of the Manhattan brokerage firm Corcoran Group, acquired Cook Pony Farm Real Estate in East Hampton and Paulette Koch Real Estate in Palm Beach. (NRT is a subsidiary of the Cendant Corporation, the New York-based travel and real estate giant.) And last March, Prudential Long Island Realty bought Douglas Elliman, one of Manhattan's largest real estate firms.
Certainly, the once-clubby Manhattan real estate industry is going more corporate. Last August, Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, another New York firm, acquired Charles Greenthal, an independent firm. Six years ago, Brown Harris Stevens began accumulating companies, buying Feathered Nest, a rental agency. In April 2001, it bought Halstead Property, another Manhattan real estate firm, which sells in a broader market than Brown Harris. (In October 2001, the holding company for all three brokerage firms renamed itself Terra Holdings.)
Peter Turino, one of three partners in Dunemere, said that they were willing to part with their name because ''it's a name that we invented'' only 12 years ago, and ''Brown Harris Stevens is 125 years old.''
