Keeping personal data close at hand has become easier with the wide range of tiny portable U.S.B. flash-memory drives available. The Iomega Micro Mini U.S.B. Drive keeps files and documents close at hand and close to your heart as well: the pendant-size drive comes with a dog-tag-style chain. It has snap-on shells in three colors so your data doesn't have to clash with your duds.
The Micro Mini drive is one of the smallest U.S.B. drives available, at about one and one-half inches in length. The drive is currently available with a U.S.B. 1.1 connection and a capacity of 128 megabytes. Later this month Iomega plans to release a Micro Mini drive with the faster U.S.B. 2.0 connection, which will take far less time to copy big files when connected to a U.S.B. 2.0 port on the computer, in capacities of 64 and 128 megabytes. Like most of Iomega's U.S.B. drives, the Micro Mini comes with the company's Active Disk technology, which allows you to run certain programs, games and utilities directly from the portable drive without having to install the program on a PC. More information is at www.iomega.com/mini/micro.html.
The 128-megabyte, U.S.B. 1.1 version of the Micro Mini drive sells for $70 and works with most versions of the Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. The package includes a U.S.B. cable that lights up, and for those occasions when flash-drive jewelry might be inappropriate, a sturdy key chain for more discreet data toting.
