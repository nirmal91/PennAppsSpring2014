To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Disputes Ex-Official's Claim That War With Iraq Was Early Administration Goal'' (news article, Jan. 13):
How long can the American public tolerate the Bush administration's evasion of criticism of the war in Iraq?
When Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary, says that focus from the start of the administration was to find a way to remove Saddam Hussein, the administration replies that it was normal contingency planning. When the criticism is about the hyping of the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction before the invasion, the administration replies that the Clinton administration thought the same way.
When American soldiers are still dying in Iraq, the administration replies that they are fighting for democracy. When the costs of rebuilding Iraq continue to grow, the administration replies that it is the cost of the war on terror.
The administration has no shame in these replies. The responsibility for the war in Iraq rests with President Bush, and he must be held accountable for the results.
