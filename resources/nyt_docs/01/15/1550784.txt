GLASS fireplace screens and doors come in many styles, from Victorian to modern. Some are purely decorative, while others form tight enclosures aimed at safe, efficient heating. Those made with tempered glass remain cool to the touch, even when a fire is raging, and afford an unobstructed view of the flames.
1. A stained-glass screen inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright is for looks only. It is 34 inches high and 40 inches wide; $399.99 from (866) 253-6560 or www.fireplace-screens-etc.com. Functional screens, in three- or four-panel models, are also available at the Web site; $246 to $383.
2. A sleek modern screen made of tempered glass, by a German designer, Peter Maly, is 28 inches wide by 20 1/2 inches high. Its stainless-steel base is six inches deep. The screen is $800 from Ameico, (888) 350-8765 or www.ameico.com.
3. Tempered-glass doors, unlike screens, provide a snug safety wall between fire and children and pets. When properly made and installed, the doors reduce heat loss through the chimney and paradoxically convey more heat than mesh screens do. When the fireplace is not in use, the closed doors prevent drafts. The doors here, from Thermo-Rite, can be installed by following the directions and using the hardware that come in the box. Most dealers can also send an installer. The company has stock doors and frames ($285 to $660) and custom-made ones ($800 to $1,700). Thermo-Rite doors have clear or bronze-colored glass-and-iron frames, which come in finishes like black, chrome, gray or bronze. The locations of stores are available from (800) 321-0313 or www.thermo-rite.com.
4. A decorative Victorian-style screen with three panels and beveled glass is 32 inches high and 48 inches wide. It is $672.52 (which includes shipping) from Old Fashioned Lamps, (877) 635-2677 or www.oldfashionedlamps.com.
5. Like a fire's looks but don't own a functioning chimney? This frosted glass and black iron decorative screen is lined with votive candleholders. It is 32 inches high and 40 inches wide; $350 from Horchow, www.horchow.com or (877) 944-9888.
