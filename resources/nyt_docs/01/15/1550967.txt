The Mohegan Sun casino and entertainment center, owned by the Mohegan Gaming Tribal Authority, said yesterday that it had begun a review for about $20 million in creative duties, which have been handled since 2001 by Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners in New York.
''We have indeed grown dramatically with the assistance of C.F.&amp;P., so the decision to move forward with a review wasn't easy,'' said George Galinsky, vice president for advertising and public relations at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Conn. Freeman has been invited to take part in the review, Mr. Galinsky said.
The review, being managed by Select Resources International in Santa Monica, Calif., is the most recent in a series for Freeman.
