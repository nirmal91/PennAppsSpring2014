To the Editor:
I used to be a registered Republican because I believed that the Republican Party stood for limiting government to its proper constitutional functions.
The explosion of the federal budget under George W. Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress has shown that the Republican Party no longer stands for spending restraint and limited government, if it ever did.
President Bush's latest proposal (''Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Marriage,'' front page, Jan. 14) for the federal government to help couples sustain ''healthy marriages'' is just the latest example of the Republican Party's abandonment of its principles.
