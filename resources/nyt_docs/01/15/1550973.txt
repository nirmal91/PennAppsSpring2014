A decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, to allow an execution was tainted by illegal voting, a judge on the court said. The judge, Eric L. Clay, wrote that a majority of active judges on the court had voted to stay the execution of the prisoner, Lewis Williams, 45, who was executed yesterday for the 1983 murder of Leoma Chmielewski, 76. But two semiretired judges, who are usually not allowed to participate in the full court, voted, changing the outcome, Judge Clay wrote.
