Sharon Dang, a graphic designer for Calvin Klein T-shirts, uses the Pantone Color Cue device at work to scan colors she wants to duplicate. So when she painted her apartment, she used her Pantone gadget to try to match Prada's minty walls (No. 579 among the Pantone hues). Although she tried three times to find the right swatch, her living room ended up Pantone 566. Frustrated, she concluded that ''my walls are not completely accurate because I was too lazy to use primer.''
Lisa Herbert, a Pantone spokeswoman, said that future versions of the technology will be programmed to display color numbers from various paint manufacturers. The souped-up Pantone Color Cue TX ($395) already recognizes almost twice as many colors as Ms. Dang's standard Color Cue, now $299. Both are sold at www.pantone.com.
