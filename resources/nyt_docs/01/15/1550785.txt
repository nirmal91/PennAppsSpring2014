First the beanbag chair and Beanie Babies, now Mogu. Newly opened in NoLIta, the bright, neon-lighted Mogu boutique, right, sells 25 styles of cuddly cushions filled with polystyrene beads the size of coarse sea salt.
The store, which has red, pink and yellow tubes dangling from cloud-shaped ceiling fixtures, is as lighthearted as the cushions. ''The idea was to make a Moguland that would make people smile,'' said Stephen Burks, founder of Readymade Projects, a Manhattan firm that designed the store.
Mogu cushions, some of which are shown on the rack at far right, range in size from the pear-shaped Pocket, 9 by 6 inches ($24.95), to an egg-shaped pouf called Ground Comfort, 47 by 25 inches ($695). They are covered in nylon and polyurethane, cotton and fake fur, and come in 12 colors.
In 2000, Yoshinobu Ishida, the president of Ebisu Kasei, a company in Osaka, Japan, that makes the polystyrene beads, swept some from a floor into a shirt, and the idea for Mogu was born.
The line was introduced in Japan in 2001 and in the United States last year. Mogu is at 258 Elizabeth Street (Houston Street); (212) 625-2444.
