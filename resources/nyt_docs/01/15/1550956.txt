The battle over how to fix New York City's public schools took a strange twist on Wednesday, when the speaker of the Assembly questioned the Pataki administration's decision to hire Standard &amp; Poor's to decide how much a good education should cost.
The speaker, Sheldon Silver, asserted that the company should not be given a $1.2 million consulting contract to determine the real cost of education because it already is being paid millions by the state to rate its bonds. Mr. Silver, a Democrat, said the company should not be playing the dual role of education consultant and auditor of the state's finances.
''How can this process be objective when the rating agency may be influenced by a valuable consulting contract with the entity it is rating?'' Mr. Silver said in a news release.
Beyond the question of a conflict of interest, the attack is part of a larger battle over how to satisfy a court order to provide New York City students a ''sound, basic education.''
