To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Sought to Oust Hussein From Start, Ex-Official Says'' (news article, Jan. 12):
Why should Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary, or anyone else be surprised that President Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein long before 9/11? Regime change in Iraq was the desire of the American government before Mr. Bush took office. He simply followed through where Bill Clinton and the United Nations did not.
As for Mr. O'Neill's (and others') distaste for our ''really huge leap'' to pre-emption, someone should tell him that we didn't attack an innocent country. We removed a brutal dictator who had it coming. We freed 25 million people and are installing representative government. If that's pre-emption, let's have more of it around the world.
