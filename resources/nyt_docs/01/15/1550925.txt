Lawrence Ingrassia, an assistant managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, has been appointed business editor of The New York Times.
The appointment was announced yesterday by Bill Keller, executive editor. Mr. Ingrassia, 51, succeeds Glenn Kramon, who was named an associate managing editor in October.
Mr. Ingrassia joined The Journal in 1978 as a reporter in its Chicago bureau, and moved to the Minneapolis bureau the next year. He served as Boston bureau chief from 1986 until 1993, when he became London bureau chief. In 1999, he was named editor of the newspaper's Money &amp; Investing section. Last month, The Journal named him an assistant managing editor, overseeing global coverage of financial markets.
Mr. Ingrassia directed coverage that was part of the paper's reporting on corporate scandals, which was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism last year, and its reporting on the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which won the Pulitzer for breaking news reporting in 2002.
Before joining The Journal, Mr. Ingrassia was a reporter for The Chicago Sun-Times from 1974 until 1978. He graduated with honors from the University of Illinois in 1974, with a degree in journalism.
