It takes a village to create a line of fabrics. Bernhardt Textiles is introducing the Winkraft brand in collaboration with Tyler Brûlé, right, a former editor in chief of Wallpaper magazine. For the project, Mr. Brûlé's design agency, Winkreative, based in Switzerland, teamed up with Jerry Helling, creative director of the parent company, Bernhardt Design, and Caroline Flueler, a Swiss textiles designer. The first offering will be Alp Maritim textiles, which Mr. Brûlé says evoke, for him, a sense of what might result ''if Switzerland happened to border an ocean.'' The collection offers the public durable high-design fabrics like those normally available only to designers and architects. (For technical types, that means they can, for example, pass the ''50,000 double rubs'' test.)
Six patterns are available. Lugano is shown on the bench above. The others are, left to right, Zurich (in a shade called ''lebkuchen''), St. Moritz, Interlaken, Luzern, Lugano and Zurich (this time in caramel). The fabrics, mostly cotton, with synthetics for strength, are 52 or 54 inches wide and cost $32 a yard; www.bernhardttextiles.com, or (877) 639 0728.
