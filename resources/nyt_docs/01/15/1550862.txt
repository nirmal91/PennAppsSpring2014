A calendar listing on Jan. 1 about a horticultural lecture series at the New York School of Interior Design misstated the surname of the speaker at a talk on Jan. 28. She is Deborah Nevins, not Devins.
The listing also misstated the time of her lecture and the telephone number for reservations. The lecture begins at 6:30 p.m., and the number is (718) 549-3200, extension 216. A complete listing for the series appears in the calendar today, on Page 7.
