Because of an editing error, a picture caption yesterday about a Swiss woman who helped rescue Jewish children from the Nazis misidentified the present residence of Uriel Luft, one of those she saved. It is outside of Montreal, not in Toronto. A credit for the picture of the rescuer, Aim√©e Stauffer-Stitelmann, misspelled the photographer's surname. He is Peter Dammann, not Dammen.
