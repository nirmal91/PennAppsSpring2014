Indonesia's benchmark interest rate fell to a record low amid slowing inflation and rising demand for the country's currency and stocks. The rate on the central bank's debt certificates that mature in one month fell to 8.06 percent in the weekly auction, down from 8.24 percent a week ago. Falling interest rates are buoying optimism about the economic prospects of Indonesia this year, despite the potential for unrest around parliamentary elections in April and the presidential elections that are scheduled for July.
