To the Editor:
Re ''To Avoid Fuel Limits, Subaru Is Turning a Sedan Into a Truck'' (front page, Jan. 13):
Environmentalists are right to point out that federal regulations allow car companies to subvert fuel economy standards in order to produce less efficient ''light trucks'' that are simply remade sedans. But they are wrong to blame Subaru: the automaker is just responding to the incentives the government provides it.
Besides, there's nothing inherently bad about producing or buying a fuel-inefficient car. The damage to the environment comes with fuel consumption.
If there is any place for more government intervention, it is in fuel consumption, not production of cars and trucks.
