Marks &amp; Spencer, the largest general retailer in Britain, reported a 3.3 percent decline in Christmas season clothing sales and said the executive in charge of its clothing division, David Norgrove, left, would leave the company. The decline in clothing sales, which was expected by market analysts, was partly offset by stronger food sales; the company's overall sales fell 0.3 percent in the 15 week period, which ended Jan. 10. The company, which is based in London, said Mr. Norgrove would leave the company when a replacement was found.
