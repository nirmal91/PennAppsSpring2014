A news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about early signs of trouble at Parmalat, the Italian food giant, referred incorrectly to the timing of its dealings with Merrill Lynch, which underwrote some bond issues. Merrill's last transaction with Parmalat was in 1999; it was not taking part in financial dealings with Parmalat when it issued a critical report on the company in December 2002.
