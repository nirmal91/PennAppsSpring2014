George Steinbrenner sent Roger Clemens a friendly letter wishing him well after Clemens surprised the Yankees by abandoning his brief retirement and signing with the Houston Astros on Monday, Clemens told ESPN Radio yesterday.
Through Howard Rubenstein, his spokesman, Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, acknowledged that he had sent the letter. Steinbrenner added that Clemens's decision to pitch for another team after telling the Yankees he was retired had not damaged their relationship.
''Roger Clemens was a great performer,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement. ''I only have the best things to say about him. I'm not at all bitter about what happened.''
