The number of complaints of excessive force, abuse of authority and discourteousness filed against city police officers rose to a five-year high last year, up 21 percent from 2002, according to the Civilian Complaint Review Board. There was also an increase in the number of substantiated complaints, up to 14.4 percent from 10.1 percent in 2002. The reasons for the increases were unclear yesterday. ''That complaints have gone up is not necessarily indicative of more police misconduct,'' said the agency's executive director, Florence L. Finkle, adding that outreach efforts and the ease of filing complaints via the Internet or 311 could explain the rise. A police spokesman, Paul K. Brown, criticized as unfair the agency's method of counting separately complaints that are thrown out because the complainant does not cooperate.
