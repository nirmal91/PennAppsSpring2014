The Panamanian authorities extradited one of Colombia's most-wanted suspected cocaine lords to the United States, where he is accused of smuggling large amounts of cocaine in recent years. The suspect, Arcangel de Jesus Henao, who was arrested last week in a joint Panamanian-American operation in a remote and lawless region of Panama, was flown to New York, where he was to be arraigned. The authorities said that Mr. Henao was a leader of the Norte del Valle cocaine cartel and that he had contracted right-wing paramilitary gunmen to protect drug routes through which cocaine was transported to the United States.
