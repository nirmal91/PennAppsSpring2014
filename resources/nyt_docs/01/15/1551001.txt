The number of uninvestigated fires last year was more than seven times higher than the number the year before, and is so large that the union that represents fire marshals says it cannot determine the city's true arson rate. Ed Burke, the fire marshal representative for the Uniformed Firefighters Association, said on Tuesday that because of budget cuts last year, 1,861 fires were not investigated. In 2002, only 253 fires were not investigated, Mr. Burke said. While the Fire Department last year stopped routinely investigating fires under three alarms, David Billig, a department spokesman, said suspicious fires and those that cause injury or death were still being investigated.
