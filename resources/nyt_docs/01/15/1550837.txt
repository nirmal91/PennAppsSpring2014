Although the iPod was originally marketed as a way to listen to digital music on the go, enthusiasts soon adapted the players for use with home and car stereos. For iPodlings who really like to drive, Digital Lifestyle Outfitters has released the latest version of the TransPod FM, a combination digital FM transmitter and iPod-battery charger designed to work with the slim redesigned iPods that appeared last spring.
The TransPod FM plugs into the 12-volt power outlet on the dashboard to provide juice for the iPod while holding the player upright in a matching white cradle. To play the iPod's music through the car stereo, you just find an unoccupied FM frequency and use buttons on the TransPod to tune its FM transmitter to the same frequency. The TransPod can work anywhere on the FM spectrum, which is helpful in urban areas where the dial is already jammed with radio stations.
If you prefer, you can connect the iPod with the TransPod's cassette adapter (a $20 accessory) or cables that plug into an audio jack. The TransPod FM sells for $100 at www.everythingipod.com. Using the car to power the iPod means the music can keep rolling long beyond the player's eight-hour battery life -- all the way cross-country if need be.
