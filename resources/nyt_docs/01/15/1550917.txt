To the Editor:
Of all car companies, Subaru, the favorite of outdoor enthusiasts and yuppified hippies, has sent a terrible environmental message. It has taken advantage of a loophole that lets it make less fuel-efficient cars (front page, Jan. 13).
Does Subaru really want to be setting this sort of example? Has it not thought about the bad reputation that this will give it among its loyal customers?
