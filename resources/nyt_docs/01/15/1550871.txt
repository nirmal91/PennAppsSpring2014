To the Editor:
Re ''Surprises in the Family Tree'' (Jan. 8). It was with both appreciation for how far our society has come and sadness for my own family's travails that I read this story. The revelation of a mixed-race background can turn one's life upside down, as I recount in my memoir, ''Life on the Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black.''
I grew up a white boy in the South; when I went to live with my black family, my white relatives simply withdrew. Not easy for a 10-year-old.
