S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, a big maker of home cleaning products, has begun a review for the broadcast and print media buying duties on large parts of its worldwide account, which are divided among several agencies. Billings were estimated at $350 million.
Kelly Semrau, a spokeswoman at Johnson in Racine, Wis., confirmed a report of the review that appeared on Adweek.com. ''As part of a routine business practice, S.C.J. is currently evaluating its media buying in some countries,'' Ms. Semrau said yesterday. A decision is expected in March.
Three agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies handle a large share of the media buying for Johnson, which sells household brands like Glade, Pledge, Raid and Windex. They are: Initiative Media, for the United States and Canada; Foote Cone &amp; Belding, for parts of Asia and Latin America; and Universal McCann, in Australia and China. Other agencies that handle the media buying include Dentsu, in Japan, and Optimedia, part of the ZenithOptimedia Group division of the Publicis Groupe, in much of Europe. The review does not involve the media duties in countries including Canada and China.
Johnson joins a long list of large marketers reviewing media accounts, including the America Online division of Time Warner, with billings estimated at $300 million; the North American division of the Coca-Cola Company, with billings estimated at $300 million to $400 million; and the Masterfoods USA division of Mars, with billings estimated at $350 million.
