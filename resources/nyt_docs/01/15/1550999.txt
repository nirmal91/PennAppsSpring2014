A Long Island contractor was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison yesterday for second-degree manslaughter in connection with the deaths of five construction workers who were killed when a scaffold collapsed in Gramercy Park in October 2001. In pleading guilty on Sept. 30, the contractor, Philip V. Minucci, 32, of Commack, admitted that he had designed the 130-foot-high, 90,000-pound scaffold without following city building codes. In her sentencing remarks, Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court in Manhattan called Mr. Minucci's crime ''the very definition of manslaughter.''
