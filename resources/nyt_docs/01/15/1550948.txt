Sony announced yesterday that worldwide sales of its PlayStation 2 game console had surpassed 70 million, despite a year-to-year drop in holiday sales. The company sold 7.83 million units worldwide in November and December, according to a Sony statement, below the 8.5 million sold during the same period last year. The drop was most pronounced in North America, where holiday sales totaled three million, down from four million a year ago. The results still put the company ahead of estimates from analysts, who have predicted a steep sales decline for the PlayStation 2 and other game consoles as consumers wait for new models. Analysts at WR Hambrecht, UBS Investment Research and others increased their ratings on a number of game-related stocks yesterday, based on presumptions of better-than-expected holiday sales reports. The 70 million total further widens PlayStation 2's lead over Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox, both of which are edging past the 10 million mark. Nevertheless, Nintendo reported strong holiday sales for the GameCube, on which it recently offered a discount. Nintendo plans to reveal specific sales figures when it reports earnings at the end of the month, but a spokesman said that holiday sales were up 70 percent from a year ago and that it was on track to meet internal targets.
