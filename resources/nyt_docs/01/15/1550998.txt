After a two-year investigation resulting in 33 indictments, the police have arrested 20 people over a scheme to defraud no-fault auto insurance companies, law enforcement officials said yesterday. They said the operation used several businesses, including two medical centers, a law firm and an ambulette transportation company, to stage accidents, file false claims, provide unneeded medical treatment and obtain fake police reports in Queens and Brooklyn to support the claims. Two lawyers, Alan Blumen and George Vishnevetsky, are among those charged. The group is accused of filing false claims to procure more than $236,000 from companies including Allstate and Geico.
