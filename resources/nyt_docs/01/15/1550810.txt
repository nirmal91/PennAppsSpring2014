To the Editor:
AARP is ''chiding marketers for ignoring older Americans'' (Advertising column, Jan. 12). That's the same AARP that based its support for Medicare prescription drug legislation on the interests of people not yet eligible for Medicare but attractive to AARP for its own marketing programs.
