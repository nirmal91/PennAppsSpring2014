To the Editor:
The State of the Union address (front page, Jan. 21) consisted, in roughly equal measure, of triumphalism, Pollyannaism, false messianism and sanctimonious smugness.
Reduced to its essentials, this disingenuous exercise in self-congratulation offered the country a continuing diet of repression, reaction, religion and inequality at home, and imperialism, militarism, arrogance and high-handed adventurism abroad.
Both domestically and internationally, the present administration confuses leadership with issuing self-righteous decrees and bullying dissenting voices into submission. It takes misguided pride in the fact that it has thoroughly militarized our society and placed the country on a permanent war footing.
The chief losers in this process, unfortunately, are the American people.
