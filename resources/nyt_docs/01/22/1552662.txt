To the Editor:
Clyde Haberman rightly bemoans the absence of eloquence among our leaders (NYC column, Jan. 16). He mistakes the cause as being a general public unwillingness to believe in emotions expressed eloquently.
When I wrote speeches for Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, he spoke at many stirring occasions, from Holocaust remembrances to commencements. At such events, a great speaker uses language to evoke and honor the listeners' own grief or joy, a task close to poetry, which demands empathy.
Many who write or give speeches today are neither poetic nor empathic; they are political power brokers, victors in staff wars, or policy wonks. Speeches are reported by a press much more skeptical than the average person. When an empathic speaker makes the effort to honor an occasion with poetry and eloquence, an audience of regular people believes and responds. And sometimes, the speech goes down in history.
