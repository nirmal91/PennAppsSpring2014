A Brooklyn doctor pleaded guilty in Federal District Court to receiving kickbacks for his referrals of Medicare patients, federal authorities in Manhattan said yesterday. The doctor, Andre B. Celestin, who was charged with the scheme in a one-count indictment in May, entered his plea on Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said that for about six years, Dr. Celestin, a general surgeon, received cash payments for referrals. He is to be sentenced in April and faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
