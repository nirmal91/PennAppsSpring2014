Whether you went through the blackout in the Northeast, live where winter storms frequently knock out the power, or just need to find your way to the baby's room, the Guardian lantern may be helpful. It recharges while hanging from a glowing blue plug that acts as a night light. When the Guardian is removed it turns on automatically and stays on for five hours on a full charge. It also turns on if the power fails. The Guardian is six inches high and gives as much light as a candle; $39 from Vessel, (877) 805-1801 or www.vesselinc.com for store locations.
