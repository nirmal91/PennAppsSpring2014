Michael J. Campbell is leaving his post as executive vice president and chief creative officer at the flagship New York office of J. Walter Thompson, where he led the creative department for three years, ''to pursue other opportunities,'' the agency said yesterday.
Mr. Campbell, 48, said he ''wanted to go try other things,'' declining to elaborate.
The agency, part of the WPP Group, promoted two executives to assume Mr. Campbell's duties. Eric Steinhauser, 46, executive vice president and an executive creative director since 2000, was named the executive creative director of the office. Nat Whitten, 43, a consultant on creative assignments since 1998, was named deputy executive creative director; he had previously held posts at New York agencies including Weiss Whitten Stagliano.
Mr. Campbell joined Thompson New York in 2001 from BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, as executive vice president and executive creative director. He became chief creative officer in 2002.
