To the Editor:
Re ''Bush, Somber and Determined, Stresses War Against Terror'' (front page, Jan. 21):
It's interesting to note that in George W. Bush's State of the Union address there was no mention of ''Osama bin Laden''; ''Mullah Omar'' of the Taliban, who is still at large; ''Israel''; ''Palestine''; ''fiscal responsibility''; ''balanced'' or ''balanced budget''; ''debt''; ''environment'' or ''environmental''; ''Democrat'' or ''Democrats'' (although he did use ''bipartisan'' once).
But he did use the words ''America'' or ''American(s)'' more than 60 times.
I will leave it to your readers to draw their own conclusions.
