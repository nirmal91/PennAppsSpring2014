Americans have taken to the DVD audiovisual format like ducks to water. And with prices of DVD players dropping below $50, the boxes and the discs are increasingly finding their way into the rooms of even very young children.
One problem is that many young children find navigating the opening menus of choices on DVD's -- Play Movie, Selected Scenes, Deleted Scenes, Special Features, Languages and Audio, to name just a few -- overwhelming. The result is often a cry for help to a parent.
No more, says Lions Gate's Family Home Entertainment division. Beginning Feb. 17, Lions Gate will release a series of DVD's that feature ''pop-n-play'' technology. What this means, a Lions Gate spokesman explained, is that once the DVD is placed into the DVD player it automatically begins. Remote controls and menus are optional.
The first wave of Lions Gate's pop-n-play DVD's will include tales from the PBS animated series ''Clifford the Big Red Dog'' and the animated adventures of the Care Bears. Each of the discs, which have been digitally remastered, will cost $15 and run 88 minutes.
No doubt Clifford would approve of a technology that makes the DVD player more child-friendly.
