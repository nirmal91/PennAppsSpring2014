The family of a man killed in August when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by Bill Janklow, the former representative and governor of South Dakota, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against him. Mr. Janklow, 64, whose resignation from the House took effect on Tuesday, was convicted last month of second-degree murder in the death of the cyclist, Randolph E. Scott, 55, of Hardwick, Minn., and is scheduled to be sentenced today.
