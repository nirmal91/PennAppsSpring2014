Ten tons of beer trapped under a frozen Siberian river were finally recovered after a weeklong operation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. A truck carrying the beer sank as it drove over the Irtysh River in the Omsk region. The driver escaped. Divers from the Ministry of Emergency Situations and workmen armed with saws struggled to free the bottles and kegs in temperatures of minus-16 degrees Fahrenheit. A modified T-72 tank was brought in, and the beer was rescued. The truck was left in the river. Itar-Tass reported that the brewery said the beer could still be sold, since it had been kept cold.
