If there was one company that had a very merry Christmas, it was eBay. The company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter sales and profit were better than expected, largely because of the success of its efforts to position its site, a vast online market known originally for used knickknacks, as a source of holiday gifts.
The company posted a profit of $142.5 million, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter, up 64 percent from $87 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The company had been expecting 19 cents a share, and analysts had forecast 20 cents.
EBay's revenue, which comes mainly from listing and transaction fees, was $648.4 million, up 57 percent. That was also well ahead of expectations.
''We were bullish going into the quarter, and we clearly outperformed our expectations,'' said Rajiv Dutta, the company's chief financial officer.
For all of 2003, the company earned $441.8 million, up 77 percent, and its sales rose 78 percent, to $2.17 billion. One reason for that high growth rate was the acquisition of PayPal, the online payment system, in October 2002.
''It took us eight years to hit $1 billion in revenue,'' Meg Whitman, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call with investors. ''Now we hit $2 billion a year later.''
For 2004, the company said it expected its revenue could be as much as $3 billion, which would be an increase of 38 percent.
Goods worth a total of $24 billion were traded on eBay in 2003, up 60 percent from those traded in 2002. The company said 41.2 million people bid on, bought or listed an item in 2003, up from 27.7 million in 2002.
Auto sales continued to be eBay's highest-volume department. In the fourth quarter, $1.9 billion worth of mainly used cars sold. The consumer electronics category was a distant second with $650 million.
EBay's market in the United States was its biggest but also its slowest-growing business, posting revenue of $291.6 million, up 38 percent. International operations had revenue of $210.5 million, up 96 percent. And its payment business, mainly the PayPal system, had revenue of $130.6 million, up 68 percent.
The company announced its results after the end of the normal trading day. In after-hours trading, shares of eBay rose $2.62, to $67, after closing down $1.32, at $64.38, during the regular session. Safa Rashtchy, a analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Company, said that investor fears that eBay would face growing competition, especially from search engines like Google, proved unfounded.
''Their momentum is so strong,'' he said, ''this is not the time to worry about competition.''
