To the Editor:
In ''Fixing Democracy'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Jan. 18), you remind us that in the 2000 election, only 51 percent of eligible voters went to the polls. About half of them voted for Al Gore and half for George W. Bush, which means that Mr. Bush was put into office by about 25 percent of the eligible voters.
You are right to caution us about 2004. That our votes, four years after the trauma of 2000, could conceivably not be recorded and counted in the coming election is a sobering thought indeed, especially since so much is at stake here and in the rest of the world.
