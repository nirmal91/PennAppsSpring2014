A student in Minneapolis who the authorities said attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, was charged in a federal indictment with providing material support to Al Qaeda. The student, Mohammed Abdullah Warsame, 30, a Canadian of Somali descent, is scheduled to be returned to Minnesota from New York to face a charge of terrorism that could result in up to 15 years in prison. Mr. Warsame was arrested last month as a material witness. News reports in Minneapolis indicated that he might have known Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks. Law enforcement officials would not comment on any link between the two.
