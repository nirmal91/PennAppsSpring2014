Earl Silas Tupper knew how to mold polyethylene into food containers that closed with a reassuring burp. But he did not understand how to market his containers until he hired Brownie Wise, a glamorous saleswoman, in 1951.
As head of the Tupperware Home Parties division, Ms. Wise gave rousing pep talks and rewarded successful hostesses with cars, furs, appliances and trips to Europe. Mr. Tupper was reclusive and jealous, and in 1958 he fired Ms. Wise and largely banned her name from corporate literature. ''Nobody knows about her,'' said Laurie Kahn-Leavitt, a documentary filmmaker. ''She's been sort of erased from history.'' ''Tupperware!,'' Ms. Kahn-Leavitt's movie about the company and Ms. Wise, will be shown on PBS on Feb. 9; schedules are at www.pbs.org.
Interspersed with vintage footage of themed parties for Tupperware salespeople, former distributors reminisce about how Ms. Wise taught them to dress elegantly and to exaggerate the virtues of Tupperware only a little.
