To the Editor:
Re your Jan. 18 editorial about electoral system flaws:
Any purge of voting rolls should be done well before an election and require notification of purged voters. There should also be a quick and easy appeal process for voters who are purged.
These actions would preclude another travesty like the one in Florida in 2000, when thousands of eligible voters were disenfranchised.
