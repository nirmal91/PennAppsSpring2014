Support for Gov. John G. Rowland continues to erode among Connecticut voters and even among the governor's fellow Republicans in the wake of his admission last month that he lied about receiving free work on his cottage from state workers, according to a poll released yesterday. The poll, by Quinnipiac University, found that 56 percent of voters believe the General Assembly should impeach and remove Mr. Rowland from office, an increase from 42 percent on Jan. 7
