Verizon Communications is in talks to sell its 23.1 percent stake in a major Indonesian cellular operator, Excelcomindo Pratama, according to an Excelcomindo executive. Confirming local news reports that talks were under way, the executive said that negotiations with China Telecom and Telekom Malaysia had been delayed last week during Excelcomindo's sale of $350 million in bonds to international investors. The executive said, though, that talks were likely to resume and that Telstra of Australia had also emerged as a potential bidder.
