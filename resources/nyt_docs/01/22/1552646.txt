A HOT shower on a cold winter day may not be as rejuvenating as a swim in the Caribbean, but it may be as good as it gets. And to make showering even better, there are accouterments to convert an old tub into a tropical rainfall, and curtain rods that add elbow room to a narrow tub. One product claims to convert a shower into a whole-house humidifier.
1. The Tasan shower curtain, from Marimekko, is made with bright red terry cloth; $49.95 at Crate &amp; Barrel, (800) 323-5461 or www.crateandbarrel.com.
2. A shower ring with a 32-inch diameter comes with installation hardware. In polished brass, chrome or brushed nickel; $245 from Clawfoot Supply, (877) 682-4192 or www.clawfootsupply.com.
3. A curved shower rod creates six inches of extra space in a standard 60-inch-long tub; $39.99 from www.stacksandstacks.com or (866) 376-6856.
4. This kit converts a tub to a shower. Included is a 28-by-54-inch rectangular chrome curtain rod, a diverter, porcelain handle taps, a riser pipe, a shower head and mounting supports; $390 from Clawfoot Supply.
5. A set of 12 rolling curtain hooks with hot and cold tap buttons is $23 at Restoration Hardware, www.restorationhardware.com or (800) 762-1005.
6. Chrome-plated hot and cold shower curtain hooks, shaped like faucets, are $12 for a set of 12. From Garnet Hill, (800) 870-3513 or www.garnethill.com.
7. Most humidifiers involve filling and carrying bulky tanks, and cleaning to prevent bacterial growth. Mr. Misty screws onto the shower pipe above the shower head. Turn on the water, push a button and it mists the room. The mist does not fog up the bathroom, and the manufacturer says humidity will go to other rooms, moisturizing up to 2,260 square feet. Mr. Misty is $39.95. A hygrometer, which measures temperature and humidity, is $24.95. My casual test indicated that after about 12 hours of use, the humidity in a 70-degree bathroom rose to 34 percent from 29 percent. While the unit was running, the humidity 15 feet from the bathroom door was 30 percent. Store addresses: www.mrmisty.com or (888) 710-7206.
8. The view through this vinyl shower curtain, with photographic images of kingyo fish, is as close to a Caribbean snorkel as you can get at home; $28 from Waterware, www.waterware.com or (845) 265-3758.
PERSONAL SHOPPER  Correction:  January 24, 2004, Saturday  The Personal Shopper column in House &amp; Home on Thursday, about bathroom accessories, misstated the Web address of Waterware, a company that makes shower curtains. It is www.waterwareinc.com.
