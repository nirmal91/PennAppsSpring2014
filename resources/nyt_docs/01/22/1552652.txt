A humidifier as small as a mug that plugs into a car cigarette lighter? In winter, nothing is more welcome than a little moisture. The Desktop Cool Mist Personal Humidifier can be used almost anywhere. It holds five ounces of water, but it will last a few hours, long enough, perhaps, to get you to the ski slopes. The unit comes with four disposable filters (they still must be cleaned). It is five inches high; $24.95, at www.hammacherschlemmer.com or (800) 321-1484.
