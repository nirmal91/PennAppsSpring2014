The Nintendo Company will release a new portable video game that comes with two screens and a gigabyte of memory. The company, which is based in Kyoto and makes the Game Boy machines, said it would start selling the console, to be called Nintendo DS, by the end of the year. The split screen will allow users to view the entire playing field and close-ups at the same time. The company did not disclose the game's price.
