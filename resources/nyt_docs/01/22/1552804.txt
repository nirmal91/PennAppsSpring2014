A South African telecommunications and multimedia company, Allied Technologies, and Econet Wireless, a cellular provider in Johannesburg, said they had created a $140 million joint venture. Under the deal, which is subject to government approval, Allied, known as Altech and controlled by the Allied Electronics Corporation, also of Johannesburg, will contribute $70 million in cash and Econet $70 million in assets, including cellular and satellite interests in Botswana, Britain, Kenya, Lesotho, New Zealand and Nigeria. Econet's company listed in Zimbabwe and its international assets will not initially be part of the deal. The venture will expand Allied's cellular telephone reach and will be based in Johannesburg.
