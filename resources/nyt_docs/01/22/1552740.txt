To the Editor:
Re ''Bush, Somber and Determined, Stresses War Against Terror'' (front page, Jan. 21):
I cannot believe that President Bush did not mention the more than 500 American service members who have been killed since the invasion of Iraq.
The least he could have done was to pause for a moment of silence in their memory.
