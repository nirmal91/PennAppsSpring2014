''I wanted to create a maze so kids will walk in, and come in with a smile,'' said Dr. Michel Cohen, a pediatrician who designed and built his own brightly colored twisting office in TriBeCa, above, complete with six fish tanks. Happy children, he said, make the job that much easier.
Dr. Cohen, inset right, and his wife, Jeannie Weissglass, an artist, designed the 1,000-square-foot curving space together. ''I wanted a marine feeling to it,'' he said. ''A waves motif.'' The office streetfront is a pale blue-gray with a purple flower box and an orange entryway.
Dr. Cohen, who grew up in Nice, France, made the wavy black sofas, above, from bent plywood, foam and upholstery. A 1950's lamp on the curved reception desk looks like a group of red, yellow and green lollipops. The fish tanks, above left with Am√©lie Sultan, who is almost 11 months old, are framed with portholes and placed close to the floor, so small children can watch the koi, tiger fish and spear fish.
Because Dr. Cohen wanted a nonthreatening environment, he hid the needles in portholes in the examining room, seen through the doorway above right. The office, at 22 Harrison Street, opened last fall. Dr. Cohen, the author of ''The New Basics: A-to-Z Baby and Child Care for the Modern Parent'' (ReganBooks, 2004) built the fixtures in his old digs across the street, then moved them over. His office number is (212) 226-7666; sorry, he builds only for himself.
