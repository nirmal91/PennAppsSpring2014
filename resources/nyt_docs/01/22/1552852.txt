A Manhattan grand jury declined to indict a homeless man on murder charges yesterday after he told the jury that he had stabbed a Bronx man in a subway station in self-defense, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office. The homeless man, Lloyd Koulen, fatally stabbed John A. Wilson at the station on 14th Street and Avenue of the Americas on Jan. 7. Mr. Koulen, who did not have a previous arrest record, was charged with second-degree murder. He told the grand jury yesterday that Mr. Wilson had demanded money and threatened him. Mr. Koulen said he tried to get away and stabbed Mr. Wilson to protect himself, Ms. Thompson said.
