Crown Princess Mette-Marit gave birth to a girl who in all likelihood will be the country's first reigning queen in more than 600 years. Her father is Crown Prince Haakon, 30, son of King Harald V and next in line to the throne. The baby, whose name was not disclosed, is second in line. The line of succession makes no distinction between boys and girls.
