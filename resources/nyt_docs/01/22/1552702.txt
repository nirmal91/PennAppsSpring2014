Most iPod owners use the device mainly for entertainment. With an accessory from Griffin Technology called iTalk, however, the music player can also be put to work as a voice recorder.
The iTalk plugs into any iPod except the new Mini. It contains a microphone, an outlet for an external microphone and a tiny speaker.
To make recordings, the iTalk relies largely on voice memo software that is supplied with the iPod. However, the unit contains its own system for automatically adjusting the microphone's sensitivity. Andrew Green, the vice president for marketing and design at Griffin, said the automatic gain control feature enables the microphone to record voices up to 100 feet away.
When making voice recordings, the iPod must operate its hard drive every 30 seconds, so its battery must be recharged more frequently than when it is playing music.
Griffin plans to ship iTalk by April. It can be ordered now from www.griffintechnology.com for $35; the price is to rise to $40 after the product is released.
Voice recordings made with an iPod are downloaded automatically when the device is connected to a computer, and the recordings are stored as WAV files.

NEWS WATCH: ACCESSORIES  Correction:  February 5, 2004, Thursday  A brief report in Circuits on Jan. 22 about the iTalk, an accessory for the Apple iPod that can be used to make voice recordings, overstated its compatibility with iPod models. It can be used only with full-size iPods sold since May 2003, which have the dual ports -- a remote port and a headphone jack -- to which the iTalk connects.
