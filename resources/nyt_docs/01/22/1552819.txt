Gov. Brad Henry introduced a $244 million, five-year proposal to raise teacher salaries to the regional average, starting with the state assuming teachers' share of health insurance premiums. Mr. Henry, a Democrat, said he would also ask the Legislature to increase salaries in each of the next four years until they met or exceeded the regional average, now $38,500. The average teacher salary in Oklahoma is $34,900.
