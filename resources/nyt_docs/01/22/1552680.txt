Israeli forces operating in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, shot and killed a Palestinian woman on Wednesday and wounded two of her family members, including a 13-year-old boy who was hit in the head and critically wounded, Palestinian residents and officials said.
The Israeli military said it was searching for a weapons smuggling tunnel in the town, which is on the border with Egypt. Troops came under fire from Palestinian gunmen and shot back, hitting one gunman, the Army said, adding that it was not aware of any civilian casualties.
