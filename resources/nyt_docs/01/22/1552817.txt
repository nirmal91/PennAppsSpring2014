When the trial of Scott Peterson moves next week from Modesto to Redwood City in San Mateo County, it will be presided over by a retired judge who is known for handling big cases. The judge, Richard E. Arnason, left, 82, served in Contra Costa County Superior Court for 31 years before retiring in 1995. Mr. Peterson is accused of murdering his pregnant wife, Laci, on Dec. 24, 2002, and dumping her body in the San Francisco Bay.
