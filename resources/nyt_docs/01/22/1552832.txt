Trahan, Burden &amp; Charles in Baltimore has resigned the creative account of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn., owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, by withdrawing from a review for the assignment. Billings on the account, which had been handled by Trahan, Burden since 1999, were estimated at $25 million.
The withdrawal of Trahan, Burden leaves four finalists taking part in the review: Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas; the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty; the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe; and the New York office of Wieden &amp; Kennedy. A decision is expected by March. Media planning and buying for Foxwoods continue to be handled by Horizon Media in New York.
