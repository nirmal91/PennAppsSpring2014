Gov. James E. McGreevey signed into law on Tuesday a bill requiring that drivers talking on cellphones use a hands-free device. The law, which is to go into effect July 1, makes an exception for drivers who are reporting an emergency or who fear for their own safety. The maximum fine is $250, and summonses can be issued only when drivers are stopped for other offenses.
