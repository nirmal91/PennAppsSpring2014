Think you have had enough snow this winter? A sheer fabric called Snow brings the blizzard indoors. ''First, I photographed a beautiful snowstorm at night,'' said Ola Rune of the Swedish architecture firm Claesson Koivisto Rune. He and his partners translated the photo into an impressionistic dot pattern for fabric. Snow is 56 inches wide; about $30 a yard from the manufacturer, Almedahls, in Dalsjofors, Sweden; 011-46-33-48-0100. To reach Mr. Rune, 011-46-86-44-5863.
