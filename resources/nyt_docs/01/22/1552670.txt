To the Editor:
The city's homeless shelters are safer than ever, thanks to new regulations imposed by the Department of Homeless Services that allow for the eviction of clients who are violent and disruptive (''Officers Reaching Out on the Coldest Nights,'' news article, Jan. 16).
Life on the streets is no life at all and almost never involves a ''choice'' in the true sense of the word. Many who choose the streets over shelters do so because disabilities cloud their decision-making process.
The reality is that the city's shelters are multiservice centers that offer homeless people treatment for mental illness and drug abuse, crisis counseling, job skills training and other services that can eventually lead to permanent housing and employment. Giving individuals the tools and services they need to leave homelessness behind for good will prevent them from living their lives in the cold.
