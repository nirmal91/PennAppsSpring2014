A new line of flat-panel televisions coming this spring from Philips produces images that are not only superior to those of conventional sets but also more restful. These seven plasma and liquid-crystal sets, priced at $4,500 to $10,000, incorporate a feature called Ambilight, a series of cold-cathode fluorescent lights that project various colors onto the wall just behind the television.
The viewer can change the color of the light projected to red, green, blue, or any combination of the three, and adjust its brightness, to generate a hue and intensity that complement the tonal balance of the scene on the screen.
During the animated movie ''Finding Nemo,'' for example, a deep-blue frame of light around the set ''gives you a sense that you're watching the movie while you're underwater,'' said Jim Ninesling, vice president for digital television marketing at Philips Consumer Electronics. Alternatively, neutral colors can be chosen that simply reduce the contrast between the bright screen and the darker walls around it.
Television makers have tried a similar approach before; in the 1950's, Sylvania introduced the Halolight, which created a border of fluorescent light around the screen as a ''frame of light that's kinder to your eyes.'' If Ambilight catches on, there may come a day when parents can no longer exhort children to turn off the television lest they strain their eyes.
