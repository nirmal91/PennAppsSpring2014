A Brooklyn man was arrested yesterday in connection with an early-morning shooting and burglary in a diner last weekend that left nine people wounded, the police said.
The man, Mark Blount, was taken into custody at 5:30 a.m., a police spokesman said. Mr. Blount, 27, lives on Miller Avenue in East New York, not far from the Galaxy Diner, where two men burst in Saturday morning and began shooting as patrons dined.
The police did not say what they thought Mr. Blount's role in the shooting had been. The spokesman said charges were pending. He was being questioned last night.
''He's under arrest, but they're not sure what they're charging him with yet,'' the spokesman said.
According to state prison records, Mr. Blount had been on parole for second-degree robbery.
The police were still searching for other suspects in the robbery and shooting. None of the eight people who were shot nor one who was pistol whipped had life-threatening injuries, the police said.
One victim, Jaytee Spurgeon, who was talking with a security guard when the shooting began, said he thought the police were making progress.
''I'm definitely happy,'' Mr. Spurgeon said. ''I hope the system doesn't let us down.''
Mr. Spurgeon, 37, grew up in East New York and moved to Harrisburg, Pa., six months ago. He was in New York last weekend for a visit, he said.
''That was a first time I'd been in New York for a whole five or six months, and this happens,'' he said.
The pace in Pennsylvania ''is a lot slower,'' he said, ''but I sleep better at night.''
