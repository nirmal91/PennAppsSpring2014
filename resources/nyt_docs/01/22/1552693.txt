Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III has secured pledges from four Persian Gulf nations to reduce their holdings of Iraq's debt, a senior State Department official said Wednesday.
The official said negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar had been far more difficult than earlier discussions with Russia, France, Germany, Japan and other large creditor nations in Europe and Asia.
One reason, the official said, is that Kuwait has continued to argue that Iraq owes reparations from its invasion in 1990. Another is that all the gulf nations had insisted that they would not discuss debt reduction for Iraq until its sovereignty was restored. Under the Bush administration's plans, Iraq is not scheduled to achieve self-rule until June 30.
Administration officials and experts say that the debts owed by Iraq to a number of Middle Eastern nations is estimated at $45 billion, slightly more than the estimated $40 billion owed to the group of leading industrial countries known as the Paris Club. Much of the Persian Gulf debt comes from large sums lent to Iraq by Saudi Arabia and other countries during Iraq's war with Iran in the 1980's.
Mr. Baker, who was appointed by President Bush to serve as special envoy for debt reduction, met Wednesday with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and other Saudi leaders.
The foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said afterward that Saudi Arabia was ready to ''enter into negotiations with other principal Iraqi creditors to substantially reduce the Iraqi debt,'' according to an Internet report by Arab News.
But Prince Saud was quoted as saying that while debt reduction would be ''substantial,'' there was no agreement yet on what that would mean. Among Paris Club nations, the goal has been to reduce Iraq's total debt of about $116 billion by two thirds or more.
