The European Commission has approved General Electric's planned takeover of Amersham, the British diagnostic pharmaceuticals and biosciences company. The commission said it saw no overlaps in business, and although they share clients such as hospitals, it did not expect G.E. to be able to cut out competitors by bundling each company's products. European hospitals will continue to have competition from a variety of suppliers, the commission said.
