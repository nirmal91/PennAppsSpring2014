Ron Rivera, the Philadelphia Eagles' linebackers coach, had dinner with Jets Coach Herman Edwards last night and is expected to be formally interviewed for the defensive coordinator job today.
Rivera and Edwards have similar backgrounds. They are from Northern California and played football at California. Rivera, who has been the Eagles' linebackers coach since 1999, attends Edwards's football camp in California during the off-season.
Rivera is the latest candidate to interview in the Jets' extended search for a coordinator, but he may not be the final one. The Jets are believed to be interested in talking to Eric Mangini, the Patriots' defensive backs coach, who is unavailable until after the Super Bowl.
