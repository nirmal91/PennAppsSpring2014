Still struggling to recover from a $1.2 billion accounting scandal, Royal Ahold, the food retailer, said it was closing its United States corporate retail headquarters in Chantilly, Va., relocating or eliminating about 100 positions there. Ahold said most of its corporate retail functions in the United States would be managed starting this summer from a new Boston administrative office that would help manage two of its United States subsidiaries, the supermarket chains Stop &amp; Shop and Giant-Landover. Ahold is in the midst of a major cost-cutting program. Earlier this week, the company announced plans to sell 204 convenience stores in the United States that belong to its Tops Markets chain.
