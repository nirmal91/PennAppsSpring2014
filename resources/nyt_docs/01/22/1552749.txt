To the Editor:
Re ''Fixing Democracy'' (editorial, Jan. 18):
In the 2000 presidential election, an antiquated electoral college system created for a rural 18th-century nation awarded victory to the second-place finisher.
Most of the elites said that such a result could never occur in modern times; it had last happened in the disputed election of 1876.
A great historic opportunity presented itself to Congress to correct this outdated, undemocratic electoral system. Not even a hearing was held on the subject.
