To the Editor:
In ''Fixing Democracy'' (editorial, Jan. 18), you repeat the excellent but often-ignored suggestion to make Election Day a holiday, which would ally the United States with most of the democratic world, which already understands how to truly celebrate democracy.
But rather than creating another national holiday, why not move Veterans Day to Election Day? Speeches and parades could still be had, while hard-working citizens stream in and out of polling places: honoring our veterans in the most meaningful way possible, performing the act that they fought and died to protect.
