A senior government official said Wednesday that several ministers and vice presidents had submitted letters of resignation protesting the disqualification by the antireformist Guardian Council of nearly half of the candidates in next month's parliamentary elections. But the resignations have yet to be accepted, he said.
''A number of ministers and vice presidents have resigned, but they are waiting for the outcome'' of the disqualification controversy, Muhammad Ali Abtahi, vice president for parliamentary affairs, told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
Iranian state news media reported Wednesday that the Guardian Council, which had disqualified nearly 3,600 candidates for the Feb. 20 elections, reinstated 100 candidates. This is in addition to the 200 that were reinstated on Tuesday.
The confrontation that began after the Guardian Council rejected the candidates, most of whom are reformists, is turning into a challenge for the reformers and their leader, President Mohammad Khatami, and their hard-line opponents. There were 83 current reformist members of the Parliament among them.
In reaction to the disqualifications, more than 60 reformist Parliament members began a sit-in that is now in its 11th day.
The country's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intervened last week, ordering the reinstatement of all sitting members of Parliament and a re-evaluation of the nonincumbents. The council is expected to announce its final decision by Feb. 10, and it has given no indication yet as to how many independent and reformist candidates will be allowed to run.
Reformers argue that by withholding its decision until 10 days before the election, the council is hoping to damage reformers' chances to campaign effectively. Accordingly, a coalition of 18 pro-reform parties said that it planned to announce on Thursday whether it would take part in the elections.
