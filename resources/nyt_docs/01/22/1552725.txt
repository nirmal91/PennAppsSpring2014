To the Editor:
Re ''Surprises in the Family Tree'' (Jan. 8): I am grateful for the mention of my contributions to the PBS series ''Frontline'' and would like to point out that there is a corollary similar to Strom Thurmond's secret, which genealogists and historians have known for even longer, that of the great political family of the South, the Gibsons.
In 1730 they were recognized by the state of South Carolina as ''free colored men with their white wives'' and the governor granted them permission to settle in the Santee River area. The relatively wealthy Gibsons would, almost exclusively, marry members of the congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial families of the neighboring states. By the outbreak of the Civil War nearly a century and a half later, they were among the most influential of the Confederate elite, a terrible racial irony.
