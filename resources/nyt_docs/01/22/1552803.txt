A French Internet service company, Iliad, said it would float 12 percent to 15 percent of its capital in an attempt to raise up to 90.9 million euros ($114 million). The company's median price offer is 15.15 euros a share. The offering will be made up of a 5,000-share capital increase, representing about 9.5 percent of the company's total share capital, and the sale of 1,000 shares owned by Goldman Sachs, representing 1.9 percent of Iliad. After the offer, Iliad would be valued at around 720 million euros ($906 million). Iliad owns Free, France's second-largest broadband Internet provider behind Wanadoo, which is owned by France Telecom.
