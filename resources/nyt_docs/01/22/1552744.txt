To the Editor:
Re ''State of the Union: Abroad'' (editorial, Jan. 21):
Your assessment of President Bush's achievements abroad is far off course.
It's hard to imagine a president accomplishing more in three years than this man has done.
After a shocking attack on our country, President Bush took the offensive and attacked the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Then, after going to the United Nations pleading the case against Iraq and Saddam Hussein, he took the offensive again and rid Iraq of the man who tortured and murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people.
Certainly, the world is safer without the likes of Saddam Hussein.
Our president is focused on protecting us from those around the world bent on destroying us; may God bless him in his efforts.
