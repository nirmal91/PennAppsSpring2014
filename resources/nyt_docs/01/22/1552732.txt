Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who has rebuked his rivals for negative campaigning, said Wednesday night that he condemned and took responsibility for a memorandum to his Iowa campaign workers that described Howard Dean as ''an elitist'' and John Kerry as ''part of the failed Washington politics.''
Reporters asked Mr. Edwards about the memorandum after a town-hall-style meeting here in which he criticized Democratic candidates for ''sniping'' and negative campaigning.
''I condemn it,'' he replied, speaking specifically of the memorandum.
''It should not have happened, and it will not happen again,'' he said.
Mr. Edwards said he became aware of the memorandum on his way to the meeting here and told staff members in other states not to engage in such tactics.
Jennifer Palmieri, Mr. Edwards's press secretary, confirmed a report by The Associated Press that said the memorandum referred to Dr. Dean as ''an elitist from Park Avenue in New York City'' and Mr. Kerry as ''part of the failed Washington politics for too long.''
Ms. Palmieri said the language was in a 50-page booklet for precinct captains to guide them in how to pull caucusgoers to Mr. Edwards's side if they were moving toward other candidates. She said the language was in ''four or five'' pages of the manual, which she said would be made available.
The memorandum had been written by ''Iowa field staff,'' she said, adding that she did not know their names.
