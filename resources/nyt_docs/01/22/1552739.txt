To the Editor:
Re ''Bush, Somber and Determined, Stresses War Against Terror'' (front page, Jan. 21):
Good show, Mr. President. Since 9/11, the country has been getting the job done.
The United States has routed the Taliban and has captured Saddam Hussein.
The economy is on the rise. As investors gain confidence, business will have the capital to expand and put more people to work.
I have no doubt that the country is in safe hands -- hands that don't ask the permission of the French when decisive action is necessary to combat terror.
