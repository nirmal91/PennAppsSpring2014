Europe's largest travel company, TUI, said it would sell additional industrial units in 2004 to concentrate on its tourism business and to cut its debt to less than 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) from 3.5 billion euros in the third quarter. The units include holdings in the logistics sector and about a third of its shipping unit, the Hapag-Lloyd Group, which is to be placed on the stock market in the second half of 2004. The profitable freight and cruise business is valued at about 2.8 billion euros. TUI has been transformed in five years from a steel conglomerate named Preussag, which acquired Hapag-Lloyd in 1997, to a leading tourism group.
