A federal lawsuit accusing New York City of supplying firefighters with faulty radio equipment on Sept. 11, 2001, has been expanded to blame the manufacturer for the equipment failures. In the expanded suit, filed on Tuesday, lawyers for the families of a dozen New York firefighters who died at the World Trade Center charged that the manufacturer, Motorola, knew about the flaws when it sold the radios to the city in 1999, but deceived officials to win an additional contract. A spokeswoman for Motorola said yesterday that there was no basis for the lawsuit, which was filed in Federal District Court in December.
