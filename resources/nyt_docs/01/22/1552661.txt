To the Editor:
As a fourth-generation Brooklynite and a proud graduate of P.S. 119, I take exception to the statement that Brooklyn is being revived by chic new restaurants in Fort Greene, artists' lofts in Williamburg and the transformation of derelict factory buildings into million-dollar condominiums in Dumbo (front page, Jan. 16).
The essence of Brooklyn is gritty, feisty, working class and egalitarian -- a unique mix that natives are fiercely proud of. Your article describes the borough's transformation into a faux bohemia that can be found in many other parts of the country. This is not Brooklyn revived, but Brooklyn destroyed and reinvented as elitist kitsch.
