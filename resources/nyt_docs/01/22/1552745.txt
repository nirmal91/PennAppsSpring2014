To the Editor:
Re ''State of the Union: At Home'' (editorial, Jan. 21):
You say President Bush's tax cuts have ''robbed'' the country of the means to deal with its problems.
Forgive me, but your remedy for what ails us -- higher and higher taxes -- will merely finance more and more spending.
Tax cuts provide incentives to generate growth and jobs and force fiscal discipline. The problem is overspending, not lack of revenues.
