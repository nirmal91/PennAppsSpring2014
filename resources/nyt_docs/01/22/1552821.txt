The chief of the United States Park Police, Teresa C. Chambers, who was told last month that she would be fired for violating federal rules regarding public statements on budget and staffing issues, has rejected a proposal from the National Park Service that would have dropped all charges against her. A spokesman for Chief Chambers said she refused the offer because it would have required her to seek permission before talking to reporters or members of Congress. Chief Chambers was placed on administrative leave on Dec. 5 after arguing publicly that her department was understaffed and underfinanced.
