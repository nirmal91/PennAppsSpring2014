A Long Island woman was arraigned yesterday in First District Court in Hempstead on charges of attacking another driver with a baseball bat during a traffic dispute. The woman, Jasmine Thomas, 24, of Farmingdale, was driving in Valley Stream on Tuesday afternoon when she and another motorist stepped outside their vehicles and exchanged heated words, the Nassau County district attorney's office said. Ms. Thomas then hit the victim, who was identified as a 50-year-old Valley Stream man, several times in the head and arms with an aluminum bat, the authorities said. She then drove off, striking the man in his legs, officials said. He was reported in stable condition yesterday at Franklin General Hospital. She is charged with assault and leaving the scene of an accident.
