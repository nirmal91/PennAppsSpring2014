To the Editor:
President Bush, in his State of the Union speech, barely finished claiming that he had brought freedom to Iraqis before he threatened to embrace a proposed constitutional amendment that would deny gay Americans the freedom to marry and other important family protections (front page, Jan. 21).
But discrimination has no place in government, in marriage or in the Constitution.
Politicians who play with fire near our country's most precious document are the greatest threat to American families and values.
All Americans, gay and non-gay, deserve respect and support for their families and basic freedoms.
Government should not be putting obstacles in the path of people seeking to care for their loved ones. And candidates, president or otherwise, should be uniting the American people, not dividing us, at a time of challenge for freedom in the world.
