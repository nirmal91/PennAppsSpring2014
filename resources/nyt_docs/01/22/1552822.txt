The Commerce Department has started an investigation into possible dumping of shrimp on the United States market from Brazil, Ecuador, India, China, Thailand and Vietnam. The investigation was prompted by accusations from the Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee, an alliance of shrimp harvesters, processors and distributors based in states from Georgia to Texas. If the investigation finds against the exporters, tariffs could be imposed. American shrimpers say that though consumer prices and demand for shrimp have risen, dumping has driven the wholesale price for shrimp to record lows.
