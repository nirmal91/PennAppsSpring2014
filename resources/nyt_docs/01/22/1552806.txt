The head of the army, Lt. Gen. Gert Gudera, has asked for early retirement, the Defense Ministry said. He will be succeeded by Hans-Otto Budde, head of the army command staff. The ministry did not explain what led to the resignation, but the local press reported that General Gudera had clashed with Defense Minister Peter Struck over military spending cuts disclosed last week.
