A court in Hamburg postponed the verdict in the trial of Abdelghani Mzoudi, accused of involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, after prosecutors dramatically announced the emergence of a new witness just one day before the court had scheduled its final decision. The unnamed witness is an Iranian intelligence agent who told investigators that Mr. Mzoudi played a logistical role within the Hamburg cell that planned the attacks, according to a lawyer close to the case.
