To the Editor:
Re ''Sun Screen in a Back Alley'' (Jan. 1): The article offers a fun peek at Lorcan O'Herlihy's quirky home in Venice, Calif. Unfortunately, it strays unnecessarily into a political realm and ends up misleading readers about the goals and motivations of preservationists working to save historic Kings Road.
Mr. O'Herlihy was hired by a developer to design a condominium on a site that is occupied by a 1936 Hollywood Regency house that was built for Joseph Greenberg, a founder of Standard Brands Paint Company. The Greenberg House is next door to a national historic landmark, Schindler House, and both are on Kings Road. Once the pre-eminent residential street in Los Angeles, it is now the most densely developed corridor in the city of West Hollywood.
The article failed to present that history, the context for the debate over preservation versus development or the preservationists' point of view.
Contrary to statements made in the article, we have never taken exception to any aspect or quality of Mr. O'Herlihy's design. Our position is that the Greenberg House (and five other houses nearby) should be preserved and perhaps adapted to a new use.
