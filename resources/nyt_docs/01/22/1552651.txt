Design Within Reach, known for its hard-edge modern furniture, has begun selling the Malinka table, right. Its online catalog entry notes the table's ''high strength-to-weight ratio'' and design by Michael Thonet, an icon of modern production. But one image shows the table topped with vegetables; a rustic pitcher of sunflowers lurks in the background.
''We're saying it's O.K. to mix our things in with Pottery Barn,'' said Mark Major, a spokesman. ''We're to the point in our business where we want to start communicating to a larger audience.'' The table, in natural beech wood or stained dark brown, is made in Poland; $345, 36-inch diameter; www.dwr.com.
