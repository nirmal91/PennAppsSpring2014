To the Editor:
President Bush ignored the environment in his State of the Union speech (front page, Jan. 21). Could it be that he does not want the public to know about the harmful impact of his administration's actions on America's air, water and public lands?
The truth should be told. More important, President Bush must abandon his harmful environmental agenda. The Bush administration should enforce our clean air and clean water laws. It should invest in energy efficiency and technologies, like solar and wind power, that create jobs and promote a healthy environment. It should adopt solutions that a president can be proud of, so that the state of the environment is not quietly excluded from future State of the Union speeches.
