To the Editor:
While Jeremy Feldbusch mourns his lost sight and lost dreams (front page, Dec. 30), he does not ''always have to be with my mom or dad.'' This 24-year-old is entitled to vocational rehabilitation, not only cash veterans' benefits, and should be encouraged to work toward the independent life enjoyed by many visually impaired individuals.
