Correction:  January 6, 2004, Tuesday  A front-page picture caption in some copies on Thursday about the New Year's Eve celebrations in New York misstated the year in which such celebrations in Seattle and Las Vegas were scaled back because of security concerns. It was four years ago, not December 2003.
