The British financial services company HSBC said it had sold its United States factoring business, which makes short-term commercial loans in exchange for invoices, to the CIT Group of Livingston, N.J. The unit has about $1 billion in loans, with net assets after liabilities worth about $270 billion, the British bank said. HSBC has been revamping to concentrate on higher profit products.
