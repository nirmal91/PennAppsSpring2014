To the Editor:
Re ''When Mental Illness Meets Police Firepower'' (news article, Dec. 28):
The frequency with which the police respond violently to the mentally ill reflects what I consider to be the most serious and dangerous problem with law enforcement agencies across the country.
The lack of treatment available to poor people with mental illness leaves no one but the police to call when a person is going through an episode. The police have to accept this fact and learn to respond differently than if they were going to a crime scene. The appropriate response involves understanding and defusing the situation, not provoking and escalating it.
Until the police accept this, we will continue to see mentally ill people killed needlessly.
