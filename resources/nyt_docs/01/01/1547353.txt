If your sights are set on ''American Idol,'' there may still be hope, even if you're no Kelly Clarkson. With the Official American Idol Audition Kit, you can mix in a little reverb and add some backup vocals to cover those tricky octave jumps. The $30 kit, available at www.auditionkit.com, Target and Best Buy, is made by Fremantle Media. It includes software, a disc with 10 songs (including ''Man! I Feel Like a Woman'' by Shania Twain and ''Rock Your Body'' by Justin Timberlake) and a membership in auditionkit.com.
It also comes with a microphone that plugs into a PC and enables you to record an ''audition'' to upload to the site, where visitors to the site can rate it. If enough of them like it, you could land on auditionkit.com's Top Contenders, and an enthusiastic response there could earn you a tryout spot for the television show.
After you have mastered the songs on the disc, you can download two others from the Web site for free. If you want more songs, the site starts charging, on a sliding scale from $6 for four to $20 for 20. Creative types can come up with their own songs.
The Official American Idol Karaoke Kit is karaoke for the goal-directed. For others, the old-fashioned approach may still be best: screaming impassioned renditions of White Stripes songs along with the car radio as you blast down the highway.
