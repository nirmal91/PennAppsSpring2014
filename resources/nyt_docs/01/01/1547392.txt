To the Editor:
With great sadness I read of one wounded soldier's return from Iraq and his adjustment to his new ''sightless'' world (front page, Dec. 30). Whether we as Americans supported President Bush's invasion of Iraq or not, the returning injured soldiers have earned the public's obligation to understand the depths of sacrifice our military is bearing.
We hear the body counts of American dead, but the returning injured remain anonymous. They deserve to have their stories told.
