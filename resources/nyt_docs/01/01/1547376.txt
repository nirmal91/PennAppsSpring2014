Lionel Tate, the teenager whose life sentence for killing a 6-year-old playmate was overturned this month, will accept a plea bargain allowing him to leave prison by March, lawyers said Wednesday.
Henry Hunter, a lawyer for Lionel's mother, Kathleen Grossett-Tate, said that Lionel had decided to take the plea deal and that Ms. Grossett-Tate supported his decision.
Prosecutors offered the plea agreement last Friday, but Mr. Hunter said Ms. Grossett-Tate was at first reluctant for her son to accept it, because she still believed he never meant to kill the playmate, Tiffany Eunick. Lionel, who was 12 at the time of the killing, was convicted of killing the girl on July 28, 1999, when she was visiting his home.
Mr. Hunter said that Ms. Grossett-Tate wanted the plea bargain charge downgraded to manslaughter from second-degree murder. But he said that ''unfortunately and regrettably,'' prosecutors would not do so.
During Lionel's 2001 trial, his lawyers said he had killed Tiffany by accident while imitating professional wrestling moves. But prosecutors maintained that Lionel had intentionally stomped, kicked and slammed the girl to death.
Lionel's chief appeals lawyer, Richard Rosenbaum, said Wednesday night that the boy, now 16, had been eager to accept the plea bargain from the moment it was offered.
''I am thrilled that Lionel's mother agreed it's better to be locked in one's house than in jail when you're only a child,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said.
The plea agreement is virtually identical to one that Lionel and his mother rejected before the trial. Under the deal, Lionel will plead guilty to second-degree murder and be sentenced to three years in a juvenile prison.
Since he has already served 33 months, Lionel will likely be released in March, though it could be earlier if the state gives him credit for time served in a county jail.
