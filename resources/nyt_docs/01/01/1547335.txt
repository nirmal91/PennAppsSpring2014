Russia's richest man, the oil billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, will be allowed to stay up late on New Year's Eve to watch television, but he will not be allowed to sing or drink champagne, according to people in a position to tell him what to do.
A warden at Moscow's toughest prison, where Mr. Khodorkovsky has been held for two months in a demonstration of the Kremlin's power, said television viewing time would be extended for all inmates to 2 a.m. from the usual curfew of 10 or 10:30 p.m.
''There will be no champagne, alcoholic drinks or singing around the tree for the New Year's celebrations,'' an official at Matrosskaya Tishina prison told the Interfax news agency. ''It is strictly forbidden by law.''
Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, has been in jail since Oct. 25 awaiting trial on charges of economic crimes as the Kremlin moves to emasculate his company, Yukos Oil, and show Russia's superrich oligarchs who is boss in Russia.
Since Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, the authorities have maintained a drumbeat of legal pressure and petty humiliations against him.
They have investigated his company's operating licenses and threatened to dun it for $3.3 billion in back taxes. Their campaign of pressure has caused the collapse of a planned merger with a second oil giant, Sibneft, that would have put Mr. Khodorkovsky at the head of the world's fourth-largest oil producer.
Last month, one of his lawyers, a woman, was searched during a visit to the prison and has been threatened with legal action after officials confiscated documents she was carrying.
In an interview early last month, another of his lawyers, Anton Drel, said Mr. Khodorkovsky had reacted with stoicism, making few requests other than to ask for books on Russian history. During his daily hour of exercise, he runs in a 20-foot enclosure.
