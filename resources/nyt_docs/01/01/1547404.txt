To the Editor:
Re ''A Pound of Prevention'' (editorial, Dec. 31): The infectious agents in mad cow disease, prion proteins, are naturally occurring. They become lethal only when their structure is altered and they somehow induce the alteration of other prion proteins, leading to the gradual deterioration of brain tissue as seen in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, however, are not apparent until years after the disease has infected the host. This is likely to be true in cows as well as humans, so there are probably thousands of ''mad cows'' not yet manifesting the symptoms of the disease.
The only way we can feel completely safe from this disease is for scientists to find a test to detect the abnormal prion protein in asymptomatic cows and to remove cattle found to harbor the abnormal form of prion from the food chain.
