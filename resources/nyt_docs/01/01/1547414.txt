Scotland's PPL Therapeutics, the company that cloned Dolly the sheep, has sold the rights to its intellectual property, including cloning technology and patents, to Exeter Life Sciences for $1.35 million. Exeter is a Phoenix holding company with subsidiaries that specialize in genetic engineering of plants and animals. PPL is being dismantled after the company's scientific feats were not followed by commercial success.
