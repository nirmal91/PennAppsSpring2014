To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Issues Safety Rules to Protect Food Against Mad Cow Disease'' (front page, Dec. 31):
Mary had a little lamb,
And when she saw it sicken,
She shipped it off to Packingtown,
And now it's labeled chicken.
This bit of verse was written in response to ''The Jungle,'' the 1906 novel by Upton Sinclair that exposed the appalling practices in the meat-packing industry.
Public reaction resulted in the pure-food legislation that (or so I was taught) corrected the abuses. And yet I read that the Department of Agriculture is just now taking new steps to ban the use of sick cows in the nation's food supply.
How did we get here? What has been going on in that 98-year interval?
