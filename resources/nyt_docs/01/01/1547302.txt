Two years ago, the Savannah College of Art and Design solicited sketches for Herm√®s silk scarves. Marilyn Grace Glastetter, a 1997 graduate, took second place with her illustration of Savannah's historic architecture, above. So, she said, ''they printed it on cotton.'' The college sells the scarf for $165 at ShopSCAD, 340 Bull Street in Savannah; (912) 525-5180.
