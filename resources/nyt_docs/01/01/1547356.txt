Small, portable hard drives have offered the traveling digital photographer a way to empty camera memory cards without lugging around a laptop computer. The Epson P-1000, however, presents itself as more than just a storage bin. It wants to be the device you use to view your pictures.
At 3.8 inches, the liquid crystal display on the P-1000 is dwarfed by the most modest laptop screen. But it is larger than most screens on the backs of cameras. More significantly, the P-1000 screen has more than twice as many pixels per inch as a typical camera L.C.D. panel.
While Epson is best known to consumers for printers and scanners, the company is also a leading producer of small L.C.D. displays for cellphones and hand-held computers.
The company claims that the higher resolution and more sophisticated color capabilities of the P-1000 display are good enough to allow users to edit and print pictures without using a computer. To that end, the device connects directly to several Epson printers, including both amateur and professional models.
The $600 device will be available later this month from www.epsonstore.com and other retail stores.
Its memory card directly accepts compact flash cards and the I.B.M. MicroDrive. Optional adapters are available for other types of memory cards. Downloaded photos are stored on the device's 10-gigabyte hard drive.
Epson predicts the P-1000 will be used as battery-powered slide viewers always have: to show pictures to small groups. Unlike its technological ancestor, however, the P-1000 can be connected to a television, projector or monitor to put on a big show.
