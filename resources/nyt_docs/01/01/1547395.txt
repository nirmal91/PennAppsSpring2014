To the Editor:
Thank you for showing us the Iraq war's human cost in pain and suffering to American soldiers and their families (front page, Dec. 30). Although the Bush administration likes to present the Iraq war as a rerun of a John Wayne movie, the war for many soldiers and their families is more like a brutal TV reality show.
