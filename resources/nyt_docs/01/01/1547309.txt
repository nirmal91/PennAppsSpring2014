Pentagram Design's calendar is devoted to typefaces, below, but not Helvetica. Massimo Vignelli's classic wall calendar is all Helvetica. ''That's his,'' said Kit Hinrichs, a partner in the San Francisco office of Pentagram. ''This is mine.'' Instead there are serifs like Hoefler Titling and sans-serifs like Bell Gothic (created in 1937 for Bell Telephone); $30 for a 23-by-33-inch calendar; $20 for 12-by-18 inches; (415) 896-0499, ask for Charlene.
