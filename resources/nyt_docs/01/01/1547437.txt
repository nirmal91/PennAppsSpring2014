An article in Business Day on Dec. 19 about an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the accounting of Take-Two Interactive, a maker of video games, referred incompletely to its earnings forecasts. The company raised its profit estimate in September for the fourth quarter of 2003 and lowered its forecast in December for the first quarter of 2004 and the full year. The projections did not apply to the same period.
