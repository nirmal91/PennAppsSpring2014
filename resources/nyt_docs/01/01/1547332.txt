To the Editor:
Gov. George E. Pataki's recent commutation of Emmanuel Nkemakolam's 15-years-to-life sentence for felony drug possession (news article, Dec. 28) is a welcome action.
But even more welcome would be a reform of the state's 30-year-old Rockefeller drug laws, which annually produce indefensible sentences for thousands of low-level drug offenders, only a few of whom are lucky enough to be pardoned.
Year after year, Albany promises action on this matter; and year after year, stalemate in Albany leaves these laws unchanged.
Maybe 2004 will finally bring an end to this mass incarceration. It should not be possible in a state that honors fiscal responsibility as well as human rights.
