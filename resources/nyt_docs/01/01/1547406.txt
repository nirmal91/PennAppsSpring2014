To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Issues Safety Rules to Protect Food Against Mad Cow Disease'' (front page, Dec. 31):
Why on earth was a ''downer'' cow -- a sure sign that the animal was sick -- slaughtered and sold to consumers? What kind of government leadership do we have that did not stand up to the meat industry lobby and did not have a long-term view of the consequences?
At last, some measures are being taken to protect the food supply. Are they, however, enough to regain my confidence as someone who grew up eating meat and who loves a good steak?
I have a work colleague who lost her spouse to mad cow disease, and her ordeal was devastating, both emotionally and financially.
Would I order a steak tonight? I'm not sure.
