A fire that killed a mother and her grown daughter on Tuesday night in Unionport was deliberately set, police and fire officials said yesterday. The determination brought the number of homicides for the year up to 595 by 6:30 a.m. yesterday, the police said. (The number was 594 before the arson finding, but one earlier death has been reclassified as an accident, the police said.) On Tuesday, investigators questioned and released a teenage boy in connection with the Bronx fire, and now have no one in custody, the police said.
