Howard Dean raised at least $15 million in the fourth quarter, bringing his total for the year to more than $40 million and assuring his position as the leading fund-raiser in the Democratic presidential race.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts raised $2.5 million in the quarter, his campaign said. That, combined with the $6.4 million in personal money he recently injected into the race, brings Mr. Kerry's totals to $8.9 million for the quarter and almost $29 million for the year.
When the books close on fourth-quarter fund-raising at Wednesday midnight, Dr. Dean and Gen. Wesley K. Clark are expected to lead the quarterly list of nine Democratic candidates, all of whom have spent much of December scrambling to raise money before the start of primary voting next month.
General Clark's campaign said earlier this week that he raised at least $10 million in the fourth quarter, enough to mount a well-financed challenge to Dr. Dean should the general do well in the early primaries. General Clark, who is retired from the Army, will also receive about $3.7 million in public financing, more than any other candidate.
