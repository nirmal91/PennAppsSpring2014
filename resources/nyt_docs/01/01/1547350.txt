The increase in high-definition broadcast and cable programming has prompted more consumers to buy high-definition television sets. But once one gets used to the sharp, clear look of HDTV programming, video from other devices -- like a DVD player -- can take on a decidedly old-fashioned fuzziness.
To improve the look of images from video sources that are not high definition, ADS Technologies has created the HDTV Upconverter, a box that scales up standard video signals into the higher resolutions that HDTV sets were designed to display.
Standard television and video images typically consist of 480 horizontal lines, but HDTV resolutions can go up to 1,080 lines, producing a much more detailed picture.
The HDTV Upconverter reformats and displays video from satellite and cable television systems, VCR's, DVD players and video game consoles at the higher HDTV resolutions.
A list of retail stores that carry the $599 HDTV Upconverter, along with more information and technical specifications, is available in the Products section at www.adstech.com.
The Upconverter has enough jacks on the back to accommodate nine video and audio sources, so in addition to an enhanced picture, you may finally be able to plug in all your home entertainment components and still have room for the PlayStation 2.
