To the Editor:
I take issue with your assertion that ''virtually nothing has been done'' to reduce the risk of a recurrence of the blackout that occurred last summer (''Taking the Grid for Granted,'' editorial, Dec. 29).
Immediately after the blackout, a joint United States-Canada investigation focused considerable resources on the affected areas and issued an interim report.
I have asked the industry to verify that it is following our standards and taking actions to prevent future outages. We are reviewing the responses and plan to conduct audits to ensure that reliability rules are being followed.
Of course, this does not reduce the need for federal legislation that would provide authority to impose and enforce mandatory reliability standards.
Whether legislation is adopted on a stand-alone basis or as part of a comprehensive energy bill, passage is essential. If reliability legislation had been enacted when first proposed, I believe that the blackout would not have occurred.
