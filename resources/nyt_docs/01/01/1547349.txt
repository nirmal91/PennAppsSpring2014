Most reference books list their entries in alphabetical order, but if you are not quite sure what you are looking for, you can wind up wandering aimlessly between A and Z. Word Menu, a combination dictionary, thesaurus and almanac from Write Brothers Referenceware, tries a more human approach to the task: words are organized not alphabetically, but into seven broad subject categories that then break down into about 1,000 subcategories.
The Word Menu software is based on a Random House reference book created by Stephen Glazier in 1992. In the electronic version, words can be found by browsing a hierarchical menu along the left side of the screen with word groupings and definitions shown in other panes of the split window. Words can be entered into a search box that brings up usage examples and related categories.
The program also incorporates a colorful animated fractal browser that displays subcategories on the screen when the cursor is passed over a main category; each click takes you deeper into that subcategory's word lists.
Word Menu works with Windows 98 and later and with Mac OS X 10.1 and later. The program sells for $34.95; a 14-day trial version is available for downloading at www.wordmenu.com.
Word Menu's database automatically updates itself over the Internet, so you will always have just the right word, even if you do not yet know it.
