As hand-held computers continue to make inroads in museums, the Smithsonian Institution has introduced a palm-size audiovisual unit that lets museum visitors explore the works in an exhibition in any order.
The wireless device, Navipass, made its debut at the exhibition ''A Brush With History,'' a series of portraits from the National Portrait Gallery's permanent collection, which opened in November in the Smithsonian's S. Dillon Ripley Center International Gallery.
Using Navipass, developed by Soundtrack Productions, a visitor can scroll through 32 thumbnail images of the exhibit's paintings and touch the screen to bring up information.
While studying the 1947 portrait of Lena Horne by Edward Biberman shown on the Navipass at left, for example, a visitor could use the device to view a clip of Ms. Horne in the 1943 MGM musical ''Cabin in the Sky'' or to listen to her 1942 recording of ''Honeysuckle Rose.''
The supplemental material includes interviews, narration and music as well as selections from audio and video archives. The device can help turn a visit to the exhibition, which ends Feb. 8, into an encounter with historical figures, not just a trip down memory lane.
