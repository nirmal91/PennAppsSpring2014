To the Editor:
Re ''The White-Collar Blues'' (column, Dec. 29):
Bob Herbert is correct when he asserts that government policy ''is focused primarily on what's best for the corporations,'' but his recommendation that white-collar workers organize to protect their jobs isn't likely to make much of a difference.
To stop the mounting tide of corporate power, we need an amendment to the Constitution stipulating that the inalienable rights accorded to the people are not guaranteed to corporations.
It is time to challenge not only corporate indifference to individuals but also the whole notion of corporate rights.
