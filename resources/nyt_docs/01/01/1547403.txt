To the Editor:
Re ''Probability, Luck and One Mad Cow'' (Week in Review, Dec. 28): The lucky discovery that a mad cow has been processed and put into our food stream has led to the widespread publicity about the deplorable state of our meat inspection and control system. Obviously ailing and disabled animals have been slaughtered and sold as food for humans.
In the Reagan administration, meat inspection was curtailed under the ideological imperative of getting the government out of the way to let industry do what it does best. There was little outcry from the public. Ideology and lobbying continued to prevent improvement and modernization of the inspection system, and now industry is seen to be doing what it does best.
