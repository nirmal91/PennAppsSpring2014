It's a conventional-looking coffee table; but then you flip the top and it becomes a spare bed. The Coffee Table bed, which comes in oak, maple, cherry or walnut, is by Julia West, an interior designer in Toronto known for her custom furniture and linens. The coffee table is 42 inches square or a 34-by-41-inch rectangle, and the open bed remains 42 inches, by 72 inches long, larger than a twin but smaller than a full. (Custom sheets are available from the Julia West collection.)
Prices are $1,360 to $1,975, depending on the finish, and the furniture is shipped U.P.S. The Julia West showroom is at 140 Kendal Avenue in Toronto; www.juliawesthome.com or (800) 300-9390.
