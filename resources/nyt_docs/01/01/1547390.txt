ROSE BOWL
4 Michigan (10-2) vs. 1 Southern Cal (11-1)  Today, 5 p.m. ABC
The Trojans got passed over for the Sugar Bowl, but can still make their case as the top team in the nation with a victory against Michigan in what amounts to a home game for U.S.C. Michigan's two losses this season came on the road, and the Wolverines historically have not fared well on the West Coast.
ORANGE BOWL
9 Florida State (10-2) vs. 10 Miami (10-2)  Today, 8:30 p.m. ABC
This is the rematch that no one wanted. These two teams play each other annually, and they actually begin next season against each other at the Orange Bowl. Still, this is one of the best rivalries in college football and both rosters are stocked with future N.F.L. draft picks.
FIESTA BOWL
8 Kansas State (11-3) vs. 7 Ohio State (10-2)  Tomorrow, 8 p.m. ABC
Kansas State finished the season with a decisive victory over then-No.1 Oklahoma while Ohio State ended its bid to defend its national title with a loss to Michigan. Kansas State running back Darren Sproles is an underrated  talent, but he will be facing the nation's top rushing defense.
SUGAR BOWL
2 Louisiana State (12-1) vs. 3 Oklahoma (12-1)  Sunday, 8 p.m. ABC
This figures to be a low-scoring game as Oklahoma boasts the top defense in the nation and L.S.U. is No.2. Oklahoma suffered its first loss of the season in  the Big 12 title game, while the Tigers won their last seven games and the S.E.C. title.
