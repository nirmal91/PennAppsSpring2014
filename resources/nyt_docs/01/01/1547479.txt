The number of fire deaths in New York City jumped to 119 in 2003, an increase of 23 percent from the 97 who were killed by fire the previous year, city officials said.
Fire deaths have tended to fluctuate, and the reasons for the increase in 2003 are unclear. Still, the union that represents fire officers is calling for the Fire Department to study the reasons for the increase.
''If there was a 20 percent increase in the crime rate, the Police Department would do a study to see what had caused it,'' said Capt. Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association. ''The Fire Department should do something similar to the Police Department to make a plan to counteract this trend.''
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the increase should be viewed in context. ''While an increase, it's an increase over a 75-year low,'' he said on Tuesday, pointing out that the 97 deaths in 2002 was the lowest number of fire fatalities since 1927. He added that one would have to go back to the 1930's to find a five-year period with as few civilian deaths as the period from 1999 through 2003 (not counting Sept. 11, 2001). In 2000, there were 125 fire deaths.
The latest fire death came early yesterday, when Tyrone Donato, a man who lived in his 1988 silver Volvo in the Weeksville section of Brooklyn, was killed after his clothes caught fire sometime during the night, officials said. They theorized that Mr. Donato's clothing caught fire on a hot plate that was powered by an extension cord from a nearby store to Mr. Donato's car. Mr. Donato apparently ran from the car and rolled on the ground in an attempt to smother the flames, but it was too late.
The year was marked by significant decreases for the New York City Fire Department: fewer firefighters, fewer fire companies and even fewer fires.
Fire officials said they had no evidence that the increase in fatalities was linked to cuts in operations, including the closing of six fire companies last May. And, they said the civilian fatality rate was still well below the high of 310 in 1970. Since then, the number of deaths has gradually declined, with only occasional increases some years.
But union officials, who have been critical of the city for reducing the department's budget and operations, said they were alarmed by the increase, which they called significant enough to warrant further study by the city.
The release of the year-end data led to another clash between the department and the fire unions, which sparred continually in 2003 over the issue of closing companies, the unions calling the cuts in operations dangerous to public safety.
Yesterday, union officials criticized the department for not releasing the number of fatalities for emergency medical calls, which fire engines also respond to. Those figures, they said, would shed light on any impact of the closing of the six engine companies.
And, union officials said the department had in the past undertaken studies when fire deaths had increased, including one in 2000 that showed that a surge in popularity of candles used in homes had contributed to an increase in deaths.
Despite the increase in fatalities in 2003, the number of fires in the city last year was still lower than in previous years. By Dec. 29, 2003, there had been 50,800 reported fires in the city -- including more than 60 during the blackout in August -- compared with 51,563 fires in 2002.
Yet the number of emergency medical runs that fire engine companies perform increased 9 percent in 2003 -- to 172,798 from 158,461.
Besides the civilian fatalities the department recorded in 2003, it lost two firefighters in line-of-duty deaths, the first since the department lost 343 men at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.
On Dec. 16, Firefighter Thomas C. Brick of Ladder Company 36 in Inwood, Manhattan, died after becoming separated from his unit as it fought a fire in a building used to store mattresses. In September, Firefighter James J. O'Shea of Ladder Company 127 in Queens died of heart failure just three hours after fighting an arson fire.
