THE holidays are over and now the house has a hangover. Gifts and related fun have left a trail of trash: empty boxes, crinkled paper and plastic cups. And those ornaments are waiting to be organized and put away. Fortunately there are storage bins and trash cans to fit many spaces. Narrow oval cans slide into tight spots. A handy cart helps when it is time to haul stacks and bags of recyclables to the curb. And there's a special storage box for strings of lights and artificial garlands.
1. A metal cart carries three plastic recycling bins out the door; the cart is $55.99, and the set of bins is $49.99. From Stacks and Stacks, (800) 761-5222 or www.stacksandstacks.com.
2. The Touch Bin trash can, by Brabantia, opens and closes at the touch of a finger (silently, so forget the usual clang). It has a black plastic rim and is 28 inches high; in stainless steel it is $199; in brushed steel it is $209, and in white or black, $220. From www.trashcancentral.com or (800) 667-8721.
