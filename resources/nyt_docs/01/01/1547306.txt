Nine years ago, Rachel Morris and her two partners at the Stencil Library, a British company, attacked their 14-room farmhouse in North Umberland and didn't stop until they had embellished every surface, right down to the carpets. ''You can get hooked on it,'' Ms. Morris said. Today they design and sell thousands of patterns, mosaics, borders, silhouettes and alphabets, in themes like Celtic or Bad Attitude. The Japanese line includes JA47 Cherry Blossom, right ($40); www.stencil-library.com or (011) 441-661-844-844.

CURRENTS: INTERIORS  Correction:  January 8, 2004, Thursday  A brief report in the Currents column last Thursday about the Stencil Library, a British company, misspelled the name of the English county where its partners decorated a farmhouse with their patterns. It is Northumberland, not North Umberland.
