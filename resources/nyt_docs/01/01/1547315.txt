To the Editor:
''Teeming Streets. Upturned Faces. Looks Like a Rebound in Tourism'' (news article, Dec. 29) reports that ''the tourists are back'' in New York City.
I'm a guide with a major tour company in the city (the big red buses), and my colleagues and I, as well as others we've spoken with in the service industry (like taxi drivers and hotel porters), would like to know: Why aren't they tipping?
The Europeans now have a strong currency, and many of the American out-of-towners seem to be upscale. Is New York that expensive? Are the city's taxes too high and thus a deterrent? Is it the price of cigarettes?
