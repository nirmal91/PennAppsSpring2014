To the Editor:
Re ''A Soldier's Return, to a Dark and Moody World'' (front page, Dec. 30):
Sgt. Jeremy Feldbusch and the hundreds of other American soldiers who have lost their eyesight, their limbs and their lives represent the true cost of the war in Iraq. Long after Iraq fades from the headlines, they and their families will go on paying a terrible price for a war that has done nothing to make America safer or more free.
There is no way to compensate the badly wounded adequately for their pain or for the shattering of their plans for the future. But what we can do as citizens is continue to question the justification for this war and make every effort to prevent future administrations from setting out to reshape distant parts of the world by gambling with the lives of young people.
