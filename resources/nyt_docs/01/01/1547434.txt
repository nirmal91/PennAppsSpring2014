An article on Friday about an apartment fire in North Bergen, N.J., that killed a 33-year-old man misspelled the surname of two occupants of the apartment and misstated their ages. They are Frances and Darren Arias, not Aires -- ages 47 and 17 (not 48 and 16). The article also misspelled the surname of Ms. Arias's brother, who spoke on behalf of the family. He is Jerry Lanzo, not Lanza.
