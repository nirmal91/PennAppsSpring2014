The state Department of Children and Families said yesterday that it had received an emergency phone line report of neglect about the father of a boy whose body was discovered on Sunday stuffed into a suitcase in Watertown. A hospital employee phoned the agency in May 1998 to report that the father, Allen Lamont James, did not get his then 6-week-old son, Alquan White, proper care before bringing him to the hospital for mild pneumonia, according to an agency statement. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the department said no reports of abuse or neglect were associated with Alquan White at the time when Rhode Island child welfare authorities, investigating a matter related to Alquan's out-of-state siblings, asked their Connecticut counterpart to determine his whereabouts in 2001. A Connecticut social worker never saw the boy and relied on a report from Mr. James's lawyer that the child was fine. The state medical examiner determined this week that Alquan died from blunt trauma. Mr. James, 38, was charged with capital felony murder in his son's death and is being held in $1.25 million bond. The state child welfare agency is being monitored by Federal District Court for failing to adhere to improvements mandated by a 1991 court settlement.
