To the Editor:
Anthony Coles, a former New York City deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs, argues that a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan would ''kickstart development'' in the area (letter, Dec. 28).
Experience, however, proves otherwise: in my hometown, Chicago, a gleaming new United Center has meant nothing to our west side except, on game nights, a flood of security guards and suburbanites who come to watch the Bulls and leave directly afterward.
Instead of repeating this mistake in New York, the city should invest in the keys to a lasting community: affordable housing, infrastructure upgrades and access to the Hudson River. If the Jets want taxpayer money for a new stadium, they should say so; it's misleading to sell it as a boon for the neighborhood.
