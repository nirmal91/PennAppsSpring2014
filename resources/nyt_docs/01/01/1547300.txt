Tim Carlander of Vandeventer &amp; Carlander, a firm in Seattle, offered to help a friend design a cabin on Camano Island, 60 miles north of the city, a few years after a 16-by-22-foot foundation had been poured. ''I asked if, for no fee, she'd let me start playing around'' with ideas, he said. The narrow lot was high on a bluff, with views across Saratoga Passage and toward the Olympic Mountains.
Seen from the outside, the resulting cabin, top left, at just 352 square feet, suggests a friendly argument between a box and a half gable. A wood-frame living space, complete with a kitchen, is topped by a sloping roof that contains a sleeping loft. On the side facing the water and a garden, the box is clad in dark gray cement board and has 8-by-8-foot doors, top right, that can be fully opened; on the other sides, panels of galvanized steel offer privacy. Those panels also form the L-shape wall enclosing a garden, above left.
The client handled much of the interior finish work, which helped keep costs to just $70,000, not including the foundation. For Mr. Carlander (above right, with Bill Vandeventer) the cabin is a gentle rebuke to the palatial weekend getaways (which he refers to as ''quaint 20,000-square-foot retreats'') typically built in this region by Microsoft millionaires. ''This cabin is basically a single-car garage with a slopey roof,'' he said. ''But it's so much more than that.'' The client seems to agree: she now lives there full-time.
