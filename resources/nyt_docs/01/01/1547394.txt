To the Editor:
Thanks to Sgt. Jeremy Feldbusch for his courage and patriotism, and thanks to you for reporting his story of being blinded while serving in Iraq (front page, Dec. 30).
Every politician, commentator and American citizen should consider whether he or she is willing to take responsibility for what has happened, and is still happening, to Americans like Sergeant Feldbusch.
