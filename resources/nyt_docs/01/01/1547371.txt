Stocks broke their three-year slide with robust gains last year. But the market still has a way to go to return to the heights reached during the bubble that burst in 2000.
The 2003 rally, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average regain 10,000, had some of the speculative flavor of the bubble's peak, as beaten down technology stocks led the rebound, although some had little or no earnings. Smaller-company stocks that many investors do not pay attention to also had a very good year.
Still, the year was a great relief to investors who had lived through a recession, an anemic recovery and the worst market decline since the 1970's.
For 2003, the Nasdaq composite index surged 50 percent, to 2003.37, its third-best year ever. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 26.4 percent, to 1,111.92, while the Dow Jones industrial average, which jumped 6.9 percent in December, climbed 25.3 percent, to 10,453.92. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks put in its best year, advancing 45.4 percent, to 556.91.
The Dow and the S.&amp; P. 500 are now at or near their highest levels in more than 20 months while the Nasdaq has not been this high since mid-January 2002. The Russell 2000 is the highest it has been in almost four years. In moderate trading yesterday, the Dow and the S.&amp; P. 500 inched higher while the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 fell.
Investors who have been in the market for years have survived the three down years pretty well while last year's rally has begun to reduce the losses for investors who bought stocks since 1998.
An individual who invested $1,000 in the stocks in the S.&amp; P. 500 at the end of 1998, a year before the market slide began, had $973, with a compound annual loss of only 0.5 percent. Those who stayed with the S.&amp; P. 500 since the end of 1981, the year before the beginning of the great bull market of the 1980's and 1990's, had $16,472 based on a compound annual return of 13.6 percent.
Now with the economy back on track and the Federal Reserve expected by many to raise interest rates this year, forecasters are not predicting as good a year for stocks in 2004.
The big gains in the three major market gauges last year were a surprise, with many forecasters a year ago predicting just a 10 percent rise in the S.&amp;P. 500 for 2003.
''People had pretty low expectations for growth at the beginning of the year, and we knew war was going to be declared,'' said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, a money manager. ''Then growth picked up, we had a tax cut and companies did well on the earnings front.''
Investors had been pummeled in 2000, 2001 and 2002. In those three years, the Dow fell 38 percent, the S.&amp;P. 500 dropped 49 percent and the Nasdaq plunged 78 percent.
''After three tough years, I think the investing public, public officials and businessmen have developed fears of the worst possible outcomes,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''When sentiment gets to that extreme, there is huge potential when the worst does not come.''
By last fall, the major combat in Iraq had ended relatively quickly and the economy was growing at a stunning annual rate of 8.2 percent, the fastest quarterly pace in 20 years. Corporate profits were heading for a 16.9 percent gain for the year, which would be the best year since 1999, according to Thomson First Call.
The $350 billion tax cut approved in late May helped keep consumers buying, job growth seemed to be back on track by the end of the year and business capital spending rebounded. Interest rates rose much less than expected because Federal Reserve policy makers promised to keep their benchmark rate at a 45-year low of 1 percent for a considerable period.
All these developments made it quite likely that the brisk economic growth in the second half of 2003 could continue into this year.
Investors showed their appreciation by pouring more than $150 billion into stock mutual funds since the market rally began March 11, the fastest inflows since the peak of the market in the beginning of 2000. And the flows were accelerating at the end of the year, based on preliminary data, despite the mutual fund scandals, according to AMG Data Services.
''The biggest surprise was the return of the public to the market,'' said Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group, a market research and money management firm in Minneapolis. And, he added, ''this was one of the big reasons for the rally.''
He said that he had expected it to take much longer for investors to regain confidence in stocks. But he said it now appeared that investors have become conditioned to thinking of the longer term and are willing, therefore, to jump back into the market quickly.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the head of the investment policy group at Goldman, Sachs, said that she saw signs that showed that some investors were still being cautious. But she added that the positive economic environment right now had made investors more willing to make bets that many companies with weak earnings now will do better in the future.
''When inflation and interest rates are low investors have more confidence in the durability of the economic cycle and are willing to extend their expectations for the economy and for the earnings of a particular company,'' she said.
Besides the big 2003 gains, investors also got a much less volatile market. Last year there were just 15 days on which the Dow rose or fell 2 percent or more, compared with 48 in 2002, 25 in 2001 and 31 in 2000, according to Scanshift, a Chicago research firm.
While there is no unanimity, many forecasters expect the stock market to continue to rise this year, but at a much slower pace. Mr. Engel of the Leuthold Group and Ms. Clayman of New Amsterdam Partners say they expect 10 percent growth in the S.&amp;P. 500.
''The discordant thing is that the big winners have been the low quality stocks and the low-priced stocks,'' Ms. Clayman said. ''In order for the rally in these stocks to be justified you have to continue to see 20 percent to 30 percent earnings growth.''
Among the head winds the stock market may face this year is a rise in interest rates. If the economy remains strong, rates should move higher on their own. And when Federal Reserve policy makers decide they have to raise their benchmark short-term rate, yields could go even higher. The Treasury's 10-year note finished 2003 at 4.25 percent, and some forecasters think it could rise as high as 5.6o percent this year.
The growing federal budget deficit, which some forecasters say should rise to $500 billion this year, could worry investors and push interest rates even higher. The dollar, which fell 16.5 percent against the euro last year, could disrupt financial markets if its decline accelerates. And corporate earnings, based on current consensus forecasts, are not expected to rise as much this year as last.
The best performing sector during the year was information technology, which rose 46.6 percent, according to the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 10 market sectors. Consumer discretionary stocks, including Best Buy, Tiffany and Sears, Roebuck, rose 36.1 percent as the economic turnaround lifted their prospects. The worst performing sector was telecommunications services, which was up 3.3 percent as a whole. Nextel, a beaten down technology stock, rose 142.9 percent, to $28.06. AT&amp;T fell 22.3 percent, to $20.30.
Another way to look at performance shows that the best performers were stocks that began the year with very low prices. For example, 222 stocks in the S.&amp;P. index of 1,500 stocks, which includes the S.&amp;P. 500, had prices of $10 or less at the end of 2002. On average they were up 84.6 percent last year and 103 of them had no earnings, according to Birinyi Associates, a research and money management concern in Westport, Conn.
Among the best performing stocks were Avaya, the telecommunications spinoff from Lucent, which rose more than fivefold, to $12.94. Lucent more than doubled, to $2.84. Dynegy, the energy company that nearly went bankrupt, rose more than threefold to $4.28. Corning, the fiber optics company whose stock plunged to a low of $1.10 October 2002 from a high of $113.10 in September 2000, more than tripled last year to $10.43.
Many of the other winners for the year were smaller-company stocks, like 7-Eleven and Dick's Sporting Goods, which are not in the big name market indexes but had gains of more than 100 percent.
Another sign of revival came in the market for initial public offerings. Although such offerings have plunged since 2000, December, with 18 new issues, was the most active month since November 2000, according to IPOHome.com.
While last year's stock market performance was strong, both the S.&amp;P. 500 and the Nasdaq have a long way to go to return to their highs of 2000. The Nasdaq has to climb 152 percent to get to its high close of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, while the S.&amp;P. 500 has to rise 37.4 percent to reach its 1,527.46 close on March 24, 2000. The Dow is much closer, needing only a 12.1 percent rally to get to 11,722.98, its record close on Jan. 14, 2000.
But with relatively low interest rates and low inflation, it is likely that the Dow and the S.&amp;P. 500 will pass their previous peaks much faster than its took the market after its last big sell-off during the recession of 1973-75. Despite a 39.4 percent rise in 1975, the Dow did not cross its prerecession high of 1,051.69 in January 1973 until the fall of 1982, while the S.&amp;P. 500 did not regain its January 1973 peak of 120.24 until the summer of 1980.
