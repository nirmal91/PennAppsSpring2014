Signs of a brighter outlook for the information technology industry are everywhere -- in the robust earnings reports that Intel, I.B.M. and other companies delivered last week, and in the latest corporate spending index figures from the Wendover-Global Insight quarterly survey of roughly 30,000 businesses.
The index, which measures the intention of information technology purchasing executives to invest in new capital projects, rose 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with the third quarter. It was the second consecutive quarter-to-quarter increase and the first time since the fourth quarter of 2000 that the index measured a year-over-year quarterly increase.
''C.E.O.'s tend to vote on how they really feel about the future based on capital expenditure, and since I.T. represents 40 percent of capital expenditure, you can really tell what's going on,'' said Larry Dillon, the chief executive of Wendover, a consulting company that compiles the index with the financial research firm Global Insight. ''I think it's a really positive sign -- not only for I.T., but this speaks to the entire economy.''
