To the Editor:
Re ''Decapitating Appalachia'' (editorial, Jan. 13):
Regional organizations and local groups all across Appalachia have been fighting coal and timber company abuse of the land for many years now -- in public meetings, company board rooms and in the courts. In many cases, they have succeeded in pressing these companies to stop destructive practices.
One of the best allies these groups had were federal laws like the Clean Water Act, which are now being gutted by the Bush administration.
I urge these regional organizations and local groups to continue to organize to stop the rape of Appalachia by coal and timber interests. Hold public rallies, participate in city and county meetings, get on the radio, get press coverage, send out fliers and call every person in your district. When enough people stand up and say, ''No, you can't do that here anymore!'' and follow up with local laws and public pressure to forbid these destructive practices in their counties, the wave of greed can and will be turned back.
