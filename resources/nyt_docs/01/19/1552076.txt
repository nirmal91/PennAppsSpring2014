Losing is not fun. Coming close game after game and never quite pulling one out is worse. It happened to St. John's again Sunday as the Red Storm scratched its way back into the game late in the second half against Villanova only to have the momentum swing in the other direction when it mattered.
The result was an 85-74 loss to Villanova and a spike in St. John's frustration level, which is rising with each defeat.
''It would be totally different if we were getting killed by a lot of points,'' St. John's forward Kyle Cuffe said. ''We have a chance and we are right there. Everybody is getting tired of saying we are right there. We want to just win.''
That has not happened since Jan. 3. The loss was the fourth straight for the Red Storm, which fell to 4-10 and 0-4 in the Big East and which faces road games at Georgetown and Rutgers next.
For most of the second half, it appeared that St. John's would absorb a routine defeat against a better team. When Allan Ray hit a 3-pointer with 6 minutes 15 seconds remaining, Villanova led, 73-60.
Ray and his backcourt mate, Mike Nardi, were in the midst of sizzling shooting performances. Nardi finished with 23 points, making 6 of 10 shots, and Ray hit 8 of 15 shots, scoring 21 points. They were a combined 7 for 12 on 3-point attempts.
But some sloppy play by Villanova helped St. John's launch a 10-1 run that cut the Wildcats' lead to 4 points with 4:01 left. Villanova (10-5, 2-1 Big East) charged right back, and all but put the game away when Ray hit a foul shot to complete a 3-point play and give Villanova an 81-70 lead with 2:20 remaining.
''We continue to fight and show some character,'' Kevin Clark, St. John's interim coach, said.
That was also the case in 6-point losses at Syracuse and at home against Miami this month. The effort has been there, but the victories have not.
Daryll Hill led the Red Storm with 20 points, Cuffe added 17 and Grady Reynolds had 16 points and 12 rebounds.
Clark is given little chance of being named coach after this season and is guiding a team that has virtually no chance of qualifying for the National Invitation Tournament, which St. John's won last year, much less the N.C.A.A. tournament. Perhaps all he can accomplish is win a handful of games in the Big East while proving that he can massage his players' emotions through what has been and will no doubt continue to be a trying season.
But there was some evidence that the players might be losing their focus. Cuffe and his roommate, Elijah Ingram, were benched for the start of the game because they were late to a film session Saturday. They apologized, and Clark said the incident should not be taken as a sign of deeper problems.
''A lot of teams have similar issues throughout a year,'' he said after the game. ''This just happened to happen when we are 0-4 in the Big East. I think there's more concern on your behalf than mine. I think we still have that spirit.''
MANHATTAN 89, FAIRFIELD 69
Luis Flores scored 27 points and Dave Holmes had 22 points and 12 rebounds as the host Jaspers (11-3, 6-0 Metro Atlantic) won their sixth straight.
Rob Thompson had 19 points and 13 rebounds and Terrence Todd added 18 points for the Stags (9-7, 2-3), who lost their leading scorer and rebounder, Deng Gai, to an injury early in the second half.
Gai, averaging 14.0 points and 9.1 rebounds, scored 3 points before being carried off on a stretcher with an injured right leg 1:01 into the second half. He did not return.
Dewitt Maxwell had 14 points for the Stags.
The Jaspers shot 62.1 percent in the first half, including 7 of 8 from 3-point range, while limiting Fairfield to 38.7 percent shooting and 1-of-6 shooting on 3-point attempts.
Over all, Manhattan shot 53.7 percent from the floor, and the Stags shot 31.4 percent.
Kenny Minor's 3-pointer gave the Jaspers a 67-48 lead with 13:26 left. Two free throws by Tyquawn Goode cut the margin to 74-61 with 6:53 to go, but Fairfield got no closer. (AP)
