To the Editor:
I have lived in New York for 25 years and have learned that rent regulation is the only way interesting people of various backgrounds can stay in the city (Op-Ed, Jan. 13). We cannot count on the decency of landlords to keep rents at below-market levels; it won't happen.
I know. I'm from Cambridge, Mass., where the state was allowed to vote on rent control for the city. When the program was voted out by people it didn't even affect, urban areas became unaffordable to anyone but the boring wealthy. Don't let that happen here!
