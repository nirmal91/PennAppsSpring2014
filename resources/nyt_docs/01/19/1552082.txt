To the Editor:
In ''Unstable and Out of Control'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 13), Maria L. Sachs says it's time to end rent regulations in New York City. She is identified as ''a lawyer who owns rental properties.''
I am 82, retired, a native New Yorker and a World War II veteran. I live on a fixed income and own no rental properties. If I did, I still wouldn't advocate an end to rent regulations because they keep millions of New Yorkers from being forced out of our city, which would diminish the character of the New York I love.
