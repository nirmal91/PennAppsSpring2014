To the Editor:
Re '''Unstable and Out of Control,'' by Maria L. Sachs (Op-Ed, Jan. 13):
My husband and I lovingly restored the small house in Manhattan where we raised our children. We have a good relationship with our rent-controlled tenant, who was here when we bought the house. She pays less than $300 a month for a third of the house.
Here's the hardest rub: Her children, who are our age and our economic peers, can inherit her apartment. Our children, now out of college and living in Manhattan, must struggle to pay high rents in order to remain here. Each would certainly have used the apartment, and likely would want to in the future. Does this make sense?
