A bomb scare on Delta Airlines Flight 27 from Frankfurt to Atlanta on Sunday forced the plane to make an emergency landing at Shannon Airport, on the west coast of Ireland, just after midday local time. The Irish police searched the plane and passengers' baggage, but nothing suspicious was found, a police spokesman said, and the plane was scheduled to depart again on Monday.
The police evacuated all 147 people on board within 10 minutes of the emergency landing and interviewed passengers about a note saying that a bomb was on board. The note was written on toilet paper and was found by crew members in the bathroom.
The plane was immediately isolated, save for one fire engine nearby, and was kept at a remote part of the airport for several hours, until the police searched it.
Passengers, who were fingerprinted by the authorities, were taken to local hotels to spend the night.
A spokeswoman for Delta said the flight was diverted for ''security reasons.'' The airline ''does not discuss security issues,'' she said.
Philip O'Byrne, a police officer at the Shannon station, said that a similar incident had occurred at the airport late last year and that the local police were equipped to handle the situation. ''It's just like any criminal offense,'' he said.
Because Shannon is one of the most westerly airports in Europe and coincides with many trans-Atlantic routes, it is often used for emergencies by planes with technical problems, said Siobhan Moore, a spokeswoman for the state-owned airport authority. She did not know whether an armed air marshal was on board.
Last year, 2.4 million passengers went through the airport, and its large runways often accommodate American military transport planes en route to Iraq and Afghanistan.
