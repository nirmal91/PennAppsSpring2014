The 801 Steak and Chop House in downtown Des Moines sits solidly on the second floor of the tallest building between Chicago and Omaha, but a bit like the mystical village of Brigadoon, it really comes alive only once every four years. In the weeks preceding the Iowa caucuses, 801's dark wood booths and cozy tables are filled with the biggest names in politics and broadcasting, drawn in from the winter cold by its thick slabs of beef and pork, honest drinks and long wine list. Fun? Sure. But also work, as Tom Brokaw and Edward M. Kennedy table-hop and swap gossip with the likes of Joe Trippi and Brit Hume. It has stayed open for the last two Sunday nights, just to accommodate the caucus crowds, and though a rival hangout has emerged in this caucus season in nearby Centro, an elegant Italian place with brick-oven pizzas, 801 remains to Des Moines what Rick's Bar was to Casablanca: The place where everybody goes.
