To the Editor:
Paul Davies misses a crucial distinction when he asserts that the presence of risk-takers in our society translates into willing participants in a one-way Mars trip (''Life (and Death) on Mars,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 15).
People climb mountains, bungee jump and sky-dive because death, while a possibility, is not a definite outcome of these activities. His Mars trip, on the other hand, is essentially a suicide mission. One might wonder if the psychological profile required for the participants would automatically disqualify them.
