To the Editor:
''Unruly Students Facing Arrest, Not Detention'' (front page, Jan. 4) highlights a challenging issue in education today. Our district takes many  steps to address discipline.
For two years, a district committee, including parents, researched codes from 23 school districts across the country to incorporate best practices for maintaining safe and orderly schools into a new code to begin next school year.
To meet the needs of nontraditional secondary school students, the district sponsors the Polly Fox Academy for pregnant and parenting teenagers, Phoenix Academy for student dropouts and Brigadoon Academy for chronically truant, suspended or expelled students.
In 1995, we were one of the first districts to embrace a national nonsectarian, nonpartisan character education program, ''Character Counts!'' This program is a daily focus in our schools.
These efforts help keep students in school to learn, and to succeed.
