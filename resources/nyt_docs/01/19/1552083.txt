To the Editor:
Re '''Unstable and Out of Control,'' by Maria L. Sachs (Op-Ed, Jan. 13):
Rent regulation is the largest, most important affordable housing program in the city and suburban counties. Its purpose is not only to protect existing tenants, but also to keep housing affordable for those who will need it in 30 or 40 years. Decontrol destroys this central aspect of the program.
This system is rapidly being phased out through decontrol mechanisms, the most damaging of which lets landlords deregulate vacant apartments when the legal rent reaches $2,000.
To talk about the program in terms of subsidies -- with the attendant debate about who deserves them and who doesn't -- is misleading. This is price (and eviction) regulation that corrects for market failure, and it should be extended to all apartments.
