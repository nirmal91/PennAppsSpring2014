To the Editor:
''Temporary Immigration'' (editorial, Jan. 12) identifies potential abuses of workers under the Bush administration's proposed temporary worker program but doesn't discuss the danger it poses to American democracy.
We are rightly concerned when citizens fail to vote. How can we create a class of permanently disfranchised residents? As Lincoln taught us, government by the people is the very heart of our national life. We would jeopardize what we hold most dear by inviting ''guest workers'' to pick our crops and clean our streets without hope of citizenship or participation in our democratic processes.
Our nation was born in a fight against taxation without representation. It would betray our origins to establish a lawfully resident caste of laborers to pay taxes, serve our economic interests and do our dirty work but not share in the work of self-governance.
America's self-interest requires that legalization of undocumented immigrants includes a path to citizenship.
