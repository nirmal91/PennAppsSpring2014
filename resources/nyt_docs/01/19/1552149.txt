Re ''Failing Teachers Face a Faster Ax'' (front page, Jan. 15):
Every child's academic success is directly linked to the quality of his or her teachers. It is encouraging to see the New York City teachers' union and the city's public school system coming together to ensure that quality teachers are serving New York's children.
The peer intervention proposal announced by Randi Weingarten, the union president, is a good example of an effective and fair system of counseling out poor-performing teachers and retaining high-quality educators. This is an important step in the city's effort to ensure that every child has quality teaching in a school organized for success.
