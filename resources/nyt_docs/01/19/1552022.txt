David Gordon's new ''Dancing Henry Five,'' performed by his Pick Up Performance Company on Saturday night at the Danspace Project, is a decidedly offbeat Shakespearean production. It spools out in a mere hour, using physical staging and movie music to tell the story. Shakespeare's words are also used in small but well-chosen dollops placed adroitly in a narrative that is fast-paced and elliptical, yet nonetheless manages to make its points about war, politics and the rituals and vagaries of love.
Valda Setterfield, an engaging blend of Mother Courage and Auntie Mame, presides as the narrator. She perches high on a ladder or spins through the swirl of motion and brilliantly manipulated swatches of striped fabric that establish shifts in time and place. The other dancers move seamlessly from character to character. Tadej Brdnik and Karen Graham emerge at moments as a stern Henry and a watchful Princess Katherine, in a group completed by Tricia Brouk, Todd Allen, Christopher Morgan, Daniel Smith and Luis de Robles Tentindo.
''Dancing Henry V'' has a subversive vein that comes through most adroitly in Ms. Satterfield's rumination about a mother's political awakening in a time of war. The play's own darkness is emphasized subtly by Jennifer Tipton's lighting. But for all Mr. Gordon's hip humor, he is a humanist at heart. He uses a killer score by William Walton, based on his music for the 1945 film ''Henry V,'' that expertly pushes all the emotional buttons. So do cannily chosen spoken excerpts from the film and from other British productions. ''Dancing Henry V'' is a delightful and accomplished evening of theater that sweeps its audiences along in a stylish, essentially feel-good theatrical experience. That may be its sliest subversion.
