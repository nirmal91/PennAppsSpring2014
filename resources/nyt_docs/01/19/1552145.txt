To the Editor:
''India's Leader Plans Election as a Mandate for His Party'' (news article, Jan. 13) mentions that India's ruling party wants to capitalize on the country's economic boom.
Indian voters threw out the deeply rooted Congress Party in the late 1980's solely on grounds of corruption. Rajiv Gandhi's government had brought tremendous prosperity to India during the mid-to-late 80's, but this alone did not sit well with voters.
Today, the Bharatiya Janata Party's corruption is rampant, and those involved in the scandals brought out by India's free press have gone unpunished so far and the cases have been dragging on.
It seems that the B.J.P. has not learned from the past choices of India's voters.
