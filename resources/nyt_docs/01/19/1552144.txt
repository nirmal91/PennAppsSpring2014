Brian McBride, a veteran striker for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer, has agreed to a transfer to Fulham of the English Premier League, according to a report on The (London) Daily Telegraph's Web site.
McBride had earlier been headed for Blackburn. Those plans changed when Fulham agreed yesterday to sell the French striker Louis Saha to Manchester United for about $19 million, according to the club's Web site. McBride will join defender Carlos Bocanegra, a teammate on the United States national team, at Fulham.
