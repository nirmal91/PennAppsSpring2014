The police have arrested six people, including one reputed gang member, who they said were involved in a fight in Brooklyn on Tuesday that left four men hospitalized, one with a severe head injury.
The fight began after a group of Hispanic men used ethnic slurs to address a group of white men in front of 200 Knickerbocker Avenue just before 1 a.m., the police said.
An argument ensued, followed by a scuffle in which one suspect used a knife, and another suspect, a bat, the police said. Two victims were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center and two to Bellevue Hospital Center. The man with the head injury is likely to survive, and the others had minor injuries, said the police, who did not release their names or conditions.
The police arrested five men on Saturday and charged them with attempted murder. They were Enrique Maldonado, 22; Valentin Hiram, 20; Ramon Ortiz, 21; Michael Alvarez, 20; and Luis Torres, 26. The police also arrested Wilfredo Ramos, 32, on Tuesday and charged him with assault and possession of a weapon.
