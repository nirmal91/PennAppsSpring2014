Northwest Airlines said in a statement on Sunday evening that its chief executive and a spokesman were wrong last September when they denied that Northwest had provided the government with data on its passengers for security studies.
The airline said the two men did not know that their company's security department had given the information to a NASA laboratory in the third quarter of 2001. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, researchers from the space agency were seeking to experiment with statistical techniques for identifying terrorists.
The denials last September, from Richard Anderson, the chief executive, in a speech to a Rotary Club in St. Paul, and from a spokesman, Kurt Ebenhoch, came soon after a smaller carrier, JetBlue, was found to have supplied data on its passengers to a military contractor.
In its statement this evening, Northwest defended its sharing of the information with the government but said it would not do the same again.
''Northwest believes that it was appropriate to provide data directly to NASA for a research study designed to improve aviation security,'' said the airline, the nation's fourth-largest.
