The police released security camera images yesterday of the two men who shot and wounded several people during a robbery at a Brooklyn diner Saturday morning.
Both men are shown wearing heavy winter coats. In one image, one of the men, who is wearing a knit hat, is shown pointing what looks to be a semiautomatic handgun.
The police asked that anyone who recognizes the men call detectives in the 75th Precinct at (718) 827-3548.
Police said that the two men shot seven customers and a busboy and pistol-whipped a teenager inside the Galaxy Diner in East New York, then fled the 24-hour restaurant with cash and jewelry.
Most diners who were shot suffered minor injuries to their limbs and buttocks, the police said, and two men were grazed in the head.
The robbers entered the diner around 5 a.m. Saturday as about 30 people ate breakfast. They demanded cash and jewelry and seemed to fire when they felt their orders were not being obeyed quickly enough, witnesses said. They fled through the front door, the police said.
The police said they knew nothing more about the robbers' identities or whereabouts and did not know the value of the stolen items.
