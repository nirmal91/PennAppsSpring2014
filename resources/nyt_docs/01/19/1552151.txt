To the Editor:
Re ''Cancer 'Prevention' Is Big Seller, but Medical Experts Are Divided'' (front page, Jan. 11):
In a recent review of decades of research, the Institute of Medicine concluded that we could prevent 100,000 cancer cases a year by 2015 if more people adopted an overall healthy lifestyle. To get there, though, means helping people to get screened, quit smoking, exercise more, eat better and keep their weight in check.
Are there still things we need to learn about cancer prevention? Of course. But not to act on the valuable information that we already have would be a great disservice.
Resources are well spent on cancer prevention efforts, and the benefits reach well beyond cancer. Healthy lifestyles also lower the risk of diabetes, stroke and heart disease.
