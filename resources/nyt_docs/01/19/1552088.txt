To the Editor:
Maria L. Sachs, a landlord, says New York City should end rent regulation (Op-Ed, Jan. 13). While there are good arguments for freeing up parts of the housing market, and while the system's abuses -- where not apocryphal -- are galling, there's a good reason to maintain protections: the extraordinary costs associated with moving in New York.
Combine a truck rental (or movers), the security deposit on a new apartment, the cost of turning on utilities and, worst of all, the high fees some real estate brokers charge for a quick read of their listings. This adds up to a lot more than many paycheck-to-paycheck New Yorkers can afford, and puts unscrupulous landlords in a position to extract unreasonable, market-defying rent increases from tenants unable to muster the thousands of dollars needed for a move.
