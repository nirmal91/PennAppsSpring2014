With Kansas City's hiring of Gunther Cunningham and Detroit's hiring yesterday of Dick Jauron, who had been dismissed as the Chicago Bears' head coach, the Jets have lost six potential candidates for their defensive coordinator job after they fired Ted Cottrell.
The Jets were denied permission to talk to Tampa Bay's Rod Marinelli, and they never got a chance to interview Tim Lewis and Jauron before they received jobs elsewhere. Gregg Williams went from the Bills' head coaching job to Washington as an assistant with Joe Gibbs, and the former Nebraska coordinator Bo Pelini went to Oklahoma as co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach. That leaves only two candidates: Johnnie Lynn, the former Giants coordinator, and Donnie Henderson, the Baltimore secondary coach.
