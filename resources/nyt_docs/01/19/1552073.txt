The pastor of a Roman Catholic church in New Haven resigned last week after he was accused of molesting a child in Massachusetts in the 1980's, an official with the Hartford Archdiocese said yesterday.
The Rev. Andrew Brizzolara resigned on Tuesday or Wednesday, after meeting with Archbishop Henry J. Mansell of Hartford, Bishop Peter A. Rosazza, the vicar general of the archdiocese, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Father Brizzolara had been pastor of St. Michael's Church in New Haven since August 1999.
Bishop Rosazza declined to discuss the details of the sexual abuse accusation, except to say that it related to Father Brizzolara's time in the Archdiocese of Boston in the early 1980's. Bishop Rosazza said he first told parishioners at St. Michael's about the resignation during the 5 p.m. Mass on Saturday.
Father Brizzolara, 56, a member of the Missionaries of St. Charles order, was told to stop all ministerial work, church officials said. He left Connecticut to live with priests of his order in New York State, Bishop Rosazza said.
Father Brizzolara was a natural leader, the bishop said; he recently led the effort to refurbish the St. Michael's parish building.
''He brought a lot of life to the church,'' Bishop Rosazza said. ''We only had the best to say about him. He's an extraordinary priest.''
Bishop Rosazza said there were no allegations of sexual misconduct against Father Brizzolara relating to his time in Connecticut.
