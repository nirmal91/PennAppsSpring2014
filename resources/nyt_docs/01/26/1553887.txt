To the Editor:
It is odd that Barry Schwartz writes that President Bush favors ''personal choice'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 22), since Mr. Bush opposes the most personal of choices: the right of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy, the right of individuals to choose how to die and the right of homosexuals to choose to marry.
It seems the president favors the right to choose only the choices he has chosen to allow.
