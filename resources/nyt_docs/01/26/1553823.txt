To the Editor:
Riders are having trouble finding the AirTrain because it is literally not on the subway map -- or on signs in most subway stations (''Finding J.F.K. Is Easy: First, Find the AirTrain,'' news article, Jan. 20).
Maps in all subway stations, cars and platforms still show the now-defunct free shuttle bus to J.F.K. terminals. AirTrain won't be added to the subway map until Feb. 22, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority publishes a new version to coincide with major route changes.
There are also few signs in the subways, and that may not change soon. When the M.T.A. ran its own airport service, it had a distinctive logo and was noted in all platform signs on the A, the line used by the Train to the Plane.
The AirTrain is a Port Authority service. But should that make a difference? Since the bulk of the AirTrain customers are coming from M.T.A. facilities, perhaps the Port Authority should help underwrite subway and commuter rail signs.
