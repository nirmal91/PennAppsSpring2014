The president of Zimbabwe, Robert G. Mugabe, suddenly flew to South Africa on Saturday, according to news reports on Sunday.
The Sunday Telegraph of London reported that the 79-year-old authoritarian leader was flown by military aircraft for medical treatment after he collapsed early on Saturday at his state residence in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.
The newspaper said Mr. Mugabe had apparently suffered a violent fit of vomiting on Friday night, then collapsed trying to get out of bed on Saturday morning.
Reached by telephone on Sunday, Zimbabwean officials insisted that they had heard nothing to indicate either that Mr. Mugabe was ill or that he had left the country.
Mr. Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for more than two decades.
