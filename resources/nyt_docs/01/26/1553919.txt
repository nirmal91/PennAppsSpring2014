To the Editor:
As a former Borscht Belt resort owner and native of Sullivan County, I take strong issue with the statement that ''casinos would mean a return to the glory days of the Borscht Belt resorts, and then some'' (news article, Jan. 20).
It is an insult to the hundreds of former resort owner families to equate the glory days of the Borscht Belt with the possible establishment of gambling casinos in the area. The nearly 1,000 resorts, boarding houses, bungalow colonies, camps and tourist homes that existed in Sullivan County from the 1920's to the 1960's, for the first time in history, provided to the working-class people of New York State and beyond a luxury vacation at an affordable price.
In contrast to the resorts' history, to revive the county with casinos would be another way of snatching from the working class their hard-earned dollars and giving it to the so-called gambling interests.
