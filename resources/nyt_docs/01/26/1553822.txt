To the Editor:
Re ''For Metro-North Trains, a Particularly Tough Winter'' (news article, Jan. 23):
After experiencing multiple delays during the past month on Amtrak's New York-Washington Acela Express and regional trains, which the railroad attributed to cold weather, I could hardly suppress a cynical ''hmmph'' and shake of the head when reading about Metro-North's similar predicament.
My hat is off to the maintenance crews called upon to return frozen rail cars and engines to service, not to speak of conductors put on the spot by frustrated, delayed passengers. But when a Metro-North spokesman says preparation is impossible, one can only wonder who was in charge when these cold-  and snow-sensitive cars were ordered, not to mention who runs the show today.
One would think we were talking about blizzard conditions in the tropics. Come on, folks. This isn't the first cold winter in the region, and it won't be the last. I suggest to any railroad executive who shrugs off responsibility that he or she visit Switzerland and spend some time studying an infrastructure that has lasted well over 100 years.
