Because of an editing error, the front page of the special expanded Job Market section yesterday carried incorrect continuation page numbers for four articles. ''A Rosier Picture for Hiring'' continued on Page 6; ''Changing Careers'' on Page 4; ''Honing Your Skills'' on Page 4; and ''Take to the Streets?'' on Page 3. The Times regrets the inconvenience to readers.
