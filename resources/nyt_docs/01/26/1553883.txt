To the Editor:
Barry Schwartz's commentary about choice versus freedom and quality of life (''A Nation of Second Guesses,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 22) articulates my own misgivings. When I hear an appeal to choice, particularly when it refers to privatization of a social program, I shudder.
The options are often misleading and confusing. Concise and accurate information is seldom readily available. We are left to make blind choices, not good ones.
As Mr. Schwartz observes, the logic of free choice must be balanced with the insight that ''there may be a point when choice tyrannizes people more than it liberates them.''
