To the Editor:
Re ''The Power of the Gun Lobby'' (editorial, Jan. 22):
While the gun industry has for years increased its profits at the expense of people's lives, it is a shame that our Congress has also chosen to profit politically at this same expense.
As you say, Congress looks as if it will not budge on the issue of gun control. If this is true, there is one way all Americans can profit in November: by ousting legislators who will not protect their own people.
