To the Editor:
It may be unpleasant to be confronted with too many choices, as Barry Schwartz tells us (Op-Ed, Jan. 22), but what choice do we have? I find myself confused and depressed at the prospect of confronting yet more choices, thanks to Mr. Schwartz.
How much choice is optimal? Are 10 brands of shampoo better than 20? Or should it be one? And what choice do we have as to who should make the choice?
Do we need some kind of committee, perhaps some kind of government agency, to help us? If so, should we choose who serves?
