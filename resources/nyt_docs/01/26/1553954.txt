A brief report in the On Stage and Off column of Weekend on Friday about a coming Broadway revival of ''A Raisin in the Sun'' referred incorrectly to the role of Lena, to be played by Phylicia Rashad. In the play, Lena is the mother of Walter Lee (to be played by Sean Combs) -- not of his wife, Ruth Younger (to be played by Audra McDonald).
