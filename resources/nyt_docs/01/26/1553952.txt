A report in the World Business Briefing column on Wednesday about the acquisition of a majority stake in Germany's second-largest brewer, Holsten, by Carlsberg of Denmark referred incompletely to Carlsberg's plans. It intends to sell some of Holsten's operations, leaving it the fifth-largest brewer in Germany. Because of an editing error, the report also misstated the headquarters location of Holsten. It is Hamburg, not Munich.
