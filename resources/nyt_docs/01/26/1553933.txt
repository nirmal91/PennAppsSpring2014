Global growth of cable television is slowing. The number of cable subscribers worldwide grew by only 3 percent in 2003, to a total of 332 million households, or 32 percent of the world's households with television sets. In-Stat/MDR, the technology research company in Scottsdale, Ariz., that compiled the data said last year's growth rate was down from 8 percent in each of the previous two years.
A lot of cable subscribers are switching to satellite, said Michael Paxton, a senior analyst with In-Stat/MDR. Other reasons include the saturation of the market in North America and parts of Europe, he said, and the high costs of building and operating cable systems, an impediment especially in parts of Asia and Latin America.
Mr. Paxton said most of the recent growth in cable subscribers had occurred in China and India -- which together account for more than 40 percent of the world's cable subscribers. The United States lost 500,000 cable subscribers last year, with most of those households switching to satellite, Mr. Paxton said. He did note one increase: the number of digital cable subscribers in the United States grew to 23 million in 2003, up from 19 million a year earlier.
