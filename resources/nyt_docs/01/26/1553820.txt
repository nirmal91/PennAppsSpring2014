To the Editor:
President Bush mentioned the issue of steroids in sports in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night (front page, Jan. 21).
As a lifelong baseball fan, I am very concerned about the effect of steroids on the integrity of baseball and its players, statistics, records and history. Let's hope that this very public message reaches those who can -- and should -- rid all sports of these substances.
