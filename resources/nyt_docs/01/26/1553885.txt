To the Editor:
Re ''A Nation of Second Guesses,'' by Barry Schwartz (Op-Ed, Jan. 22):
Although economists accept it as axiomatic that more choices necessarily make us better off, there is a German proverb, ''He who must choose is tormented.'' And there is the little girl who complains to her mother, ''Mummy, must I always do as I like?''
