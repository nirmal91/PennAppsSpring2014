What's bad for the United States Postal Service might be good for people sick of political mail.
One week ago, as the Iowa caucuses approached, many of the candidates flooded homes in Iowa and New Hampshire with rough-and-tumble mailings critical of their opponents.
But such mailings seem to have come to an abrupt halt here, with several campaigns saying that Iowa voters seemed to have responded to particularly aggressive blitzes by Howard Dean, former governor of Vermont, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt by knocking them lower in the pack, and that they did not want to fall into the same trap.
Senator John Kerry's campaign, for instance, had mailed out a piece of literature in New Hampshire that lauded Mr. Kerry as ''a strong, experienced leader who will change America.'' But the pamphlet said that Gen. Wesley K. Clark ''was not a Democrat when he started running for president,'' and that Dr. Dean's ''constant gaffes show he is not ready to be president.''
Dr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt had produced similar pieces.
But neither Dr. Dean nor Mr. Kerry have mailed such pieces this time, said all of the campaigns, who reported no new attack mail from anybody in the field.
''I think that Iowa showed everyone that going negative does not attract votes,'' Mr. Kerry's spokeswoman, Stephanie Cutter, said. ''Voters want to hear what candidates stand for and what they'll fight for, not just an angry message.''
Ms. Cutter disputed the notion that the earlier piece criticizing General Clark and Dr. Dean was negative, saying that it was, rather, a simple restatement of facts reported in the news media.
It is not clear that the truce will last through Election Day. Monday is, of course, a new day for the mailman.
