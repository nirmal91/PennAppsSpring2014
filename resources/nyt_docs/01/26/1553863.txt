After a monthlong search, the Jets, as expected, will name Donnie Henderson their new defensive coordinator today.
The hiring of Henderson, who has been Baltimore's secondary coach since 1999, has been anticipated since Ron Rivera, who has been the Philadelphia Eagles' linebackers coach the last five seasons, accepted the defensive coordinator's post with the Chicago Bears on Friday. Rivera had interviewed with the Jets, but when he chose Chicago, it became clear that Henderson would be the Jets' choice.
Henderson joined the Ravens after 15 seasons as a collegiate assistant. Jets Coach Herman Edwards liked him because of his ability to adapt when the Ravens had significant personnel turnover because of a salary-cap purge after their Super Bowl championship in 2001.
The Jets are expected to have many new faces on defense next season -- at least two linebackers and half of the secondary -- as Edwards seeks to return the team to the playoffs after a 6-10 season that cost the former defensive coordinator, Ted Cottrell, his job.
The Jets also interviewed Gregg Williams, Gunther Cunningham and Bo Pellini, all of whom took jobs elsewhere. The Jets were denied permission to speak to Tampa Bay's defensive line coach, Rod Marinelli, and had expressed interest in speaking to Tim Lewis and Dick Jauron, both of whom went elsewhere.
