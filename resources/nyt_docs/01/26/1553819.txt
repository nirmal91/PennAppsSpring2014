To the Editor:
''A Good Year for Reform'' (editorial, ''Fixing Albany'' series, Jan. 19) hits the mark regarding politicians in Albany.
This is a good year for reform, but that reform should come from the voters.
New York desperately needs to have a term-limit proposal put before the voters.
Two terms of four years each should be enough for any Albany legislator or the governor. New York City already has term limits for the mayor and the City Council. It's time to develop a term-limit proposal for Albany and put it before the voters!
