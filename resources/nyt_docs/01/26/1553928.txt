The problem of spam e-mail messages will be gone within two years, Bill Gates promised Friday.
Speaking at a late-night session of the World Economic Forum, Mr. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said the company was working on three ways to enable e-mail users to keep spam out of their computers.
The first two, he said, would involve having computers reply automatically to any e-mail messages from senders not known to that computer -- that is, not in the mail list of the e-mail program installed on the computer -- with a request to solve a problem that could be handled by a person but not by a computer. The problem could be visual or computational, but having to reply would presumably deter those who send out millions of junk e-mail messages.
The third way, which Mr. Gates said was likely to arrive later but be the long-term solution, would require that e-mail messages sent by strangers come with postage attached, the equivalent of a postage stamp.
''If the sender is your long-lost brother,'' he said, the payment can be declined, costing the sender nothing.
But recipients who want to fight spam would always accept the payment if the incoming mail appeared to be spam, making the sending of such messages uneconomic.
Mr. Gates made the forecast during an interview with Charlie Rose, the television talk show host.
