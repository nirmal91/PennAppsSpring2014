To the Editor:
While having reasonable, rational control on firearms is a necessary part of any civilized society, unsubstantiated statements about the efficacy of gun control laws only inflame passions and paralyze moderates trying to craft compromises between the pro-  and anti-gun forces in America.
In ''The Power of the Gun Lobby'' (editorial, Jan. 22), you say the assault weapons ban has ''saved lives.'' This has not been proved. Few, if any, crimes have ever been committed with so-called semiautomatic assault weapons that were or are legally owned.
While some violent criminals do use machine guns to further their illicit activities, those weapons are banned not by the soon-to-expire assault weapons law, but rather by a 1934 federal statute that regulates, taxes and in some cases outlaws fully automatic weapons.
