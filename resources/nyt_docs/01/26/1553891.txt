In the third unexpected and abrupt departure of a top agency executive in three days, Lee Daley left his post Friday as the co-chief executive and chief strategy officer at the Red Cell division of the WPP Group, based in London.
Andy Berlin, the other chief executive at Red Cell, based in New York, will now be the only one, the agency said in a statement.
Mr. Daley, 40, said in a phone interview that the decision to leave was his own. ''I quit after two years of living on airplanes,'' traveling between Europe and the United States, he said, adding that he was considering opening an agency in either place -- but not both.
Mr. Berlin, 53, continues as chairman at Berlin Cameron/Red Cell, the American flagship of Red Cell.
He and Mr. Daley had shared duties since December 2001, when WPP bought Mr. Berlin's agency, Berlin Cameron &amp; Partners, and designated it as the American nucleus of Red Cell.
Mr. Daley was hired from a leading strategic post at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, which is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Mr. Daley's surprising departure last week came after those of Bob Schmetterer as chairman and chief executive at the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas and Michael J. Campbell as executive vice president and chief creative officer at the flagship New York office of J. Walter Thompson, also part of WPP.
