A small but spirited collection of Nets fans outside Continental Arena on Sunday waved signs and chanted against the team's proposed move to Brooklyn.
A few dozen people gathered in single-digit temperatures, some with paint on their faces, others carrying signs that read, ''Nets Don't Move'' or ''Brooklyn? Fuhgettaboudit.'' Plastic rats were handed out as a gibe at Bruce C. Ratner, the new owner.
Mike Kozlowski, founder of JoeNetsfan.com, arranged the demonstration. Kozlowski said he planned to keep protesting at future home games and unite with Patti Hagan, a leader of the Prospect Heights Action Coalition in Brooklyn, which opposes building the arena in Brooklyn that Ratner has proposed.
''I have to continue to get support from Nets fans, which obviously isn't easy given the history of Nets fans, but I think we can do it,'' said Kozlowksi, who lives in Waldwick, N.J.
Protesters were incensed that they could not take their signs into the arena. Security guards said they were ordered by arena officials to confiscate signs having to do with the sale.
''It's ludicrous,'' said Chris Suswal, a 32-year-old marketing consultant who is from Metuchen, N.J., and grew up as a Nets fan, but who now lives in Brooklyn. ''I am on both sides of this issue -- I don't want to see residents in Brooklyn ousted from their homes and I don't want to see New Jersey lose its team..''
