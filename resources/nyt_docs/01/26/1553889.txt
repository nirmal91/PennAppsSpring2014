To the Editor:
In our current satisfaction-guaranteed consumer's paradise, I often find myself exchanging a purchase after deciding that one of my many other options was, indeed, just a little bit better. Now I hear that paradise may be tarnished and my particular variety of buyer's remorse is the subject of psychological study (''A Nation of Second Guesses,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 22).
Should I someday expect a pill -- and only one pill -- to treat my fickle shopping habits?
