A 22-year-old man was killed and three other men were injured in an outburst of violence that erupted on a street in Brooklyn early yesterday, the police said.
The man who died, Blake Harper, whose address was not determined last night, was shot once in the chest at 4:10 a.m. in front of 70 Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York, investigators said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The three other victims were in stable condition yesterday at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, the police said. They were a 27-year-old man who was shot in the chest, a 21-year-old man who was shot in the lower back, and another man, whose age was not disclosed, who was stabbed twice in the stomach.
The circumstances surrounding the attack were unclear last night, and there were no arrests.
