To the Editor:
With regard to the lack of progress on the building of casinos in the Catskills, there are a couple of other factors not cited in ''Casino Deals Are Stalled by State, U.S. and Tribal Hurdles'' (news article, Jan. 20).
Critical to the Iroquois is the lack of fiscal accountability for the three existing casinos in New York. We don't have access to the books, so most Iroquois have no clue as to how much casino money is being generated, allegedly on our behalf, or where it is being spent. Certainly the average Iroquois is no better off now than before the casinos.
Someone's getting rich, and it is not us.
Another factor in our resistance to the Catskills casinos is Gov. George E. Pataki's insistence that we must resolve our land claims in his favor before he will enter into a gambling compact. Yes, there are those among us who will eagerly trade land for casinos, but most Iroquois believe that we have fought for too long to preserve our ancestral territories just to trade it off for gold and silver trinkets.
You fooled us once and got Manhattan. That won't happen this time.
