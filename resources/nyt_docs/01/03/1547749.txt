Buoyed by large demonstrations against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, opposition groups presented a plan to lead Haiti out of its political crisis. The Democratic Convention, an alliance of political, business, labor and professional organizations, called on Mr. Aristide to resign and for a neutral government to take over until elections can be held. Mr. Aristide, whose disputed re-election in 2000 set off the current crisis, has vowed to finish his term, which expires in 2006, and has called for new legislative elections this year.
