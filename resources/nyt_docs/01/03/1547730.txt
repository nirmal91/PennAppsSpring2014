To the Editor:
Re ''Who's Nader Now?,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 2):
Yep, I'm a Howard Dean supporter. And he was correct in saying that the capture of Saddam Hussein did not make us safer. You just have to read the newspaper about all the canceled and escorted flights into the United States the last few days.
Then, there is Dr. Dean's statement about a fair trial for Osama bin Laden. In our judicial system one is innocent until proved otherwise. One wonders if Senator John Kerry and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who criticized Dr. Dean's comment, care about that.
