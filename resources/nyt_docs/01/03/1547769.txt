A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend yesterday about holiday film releases misspelled the surname of the author of the novel on which the film ''Cold Mountain'' is based. He is Charles Frazier, not Frasier.
The article also gave a credit erroneously to Andre Dubus III, author of the novel that was the basis of the current film ''House of Sand and Fog.''  ''In the Bedroom,'' (2001), to which the new film was likened, was based on a story by Andre Dubus, the father of Andre III.
