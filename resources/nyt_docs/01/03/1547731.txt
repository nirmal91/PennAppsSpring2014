To the Editor:
Re ''Who's Nader Now?,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 2):
If Howard Dean loses because he is unable to rise above attacks on him by fellow Democrats, that will be his fault. He will be like Al Gore in that they both had formidable campaigns until they were seriously challenged because they did not adequately unify Americans with different viewpoints and loyalties, a key presidential trait.
