Tennessee Titans (12-4) at Baltimore Ravens (10-6)
It's a classic matchup of strength versus strength: Jamal Lewis, the league's breakout runner, against the Titans, the league's best rushing defense. Lewis, who this week was named the league's top offensive player, has captivated the league with his stunning combination of size and speed. He fell 39 yards short of Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record, but there is little else Lewis has failed to do this season. He had 12 100-yard games and has stabilized the Ravens' shaky offense (the passing game is last in the league). The Ravens are the only team in the league that had more yards rushing than passing.
The Ravens also have the best defensive player in the game in linebacker Ray Lewis. But the Titans ranked higher in overall defense against the run, in part because on many occasions this season their offense scored so many points early that opponents were forced to abandon the run to play catch-up (opponents ran just 342 times against the Titans, the fewest rushing attempts against any team this season) and because the Titans' passing defense was ranked 30th in the league.
Still, the Titans will take their chances with their secondary and put eight players at the line to stop Lewis and force quarterback Anthony Wright to try to beat them.
