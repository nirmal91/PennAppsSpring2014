To the Editor:
Re ''New Year's Wishes, Revised'' (editorial, Jan. 1):
While you have pragmatically and reluctantly scaled back your wishes for national fuel economy standards and local trash removal, millions of environmentally concerned citizens will continue to wish for and act toward redressing the current rightward political tilt favoring corporate profits over environmental protection and public health.
We must find a better balance, one founded on an objective consideration of all factors, not just on who wields the most power at the moment.
Environmental effects on public health are too important to leave to power politics.
