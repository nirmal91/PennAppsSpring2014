Dallas Cowboys (10-6) at Carolina Panthers (11-5)
This game may come down to how well Dallas quarterback Quincy Carter handles the pressure of his first playoff game, not to mention the pressure Carolina's front four will bring to bear.
Carter had a remarkable season for a player consigned to the scrap heap before Coach Bill Parcells installed him as the starter. He threw for 3,302 yards and helped the Cowboys overcome the lack of a consistent running game. But he remained prone to mistakes. Only two quarterbacks had more interceptions.
The Carolina defense relies heavily on the skills of ends Mike Rucker (12 sacks) and Julius Peppers (7).
Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme has no more playoff experience than Carter, but he does have a running game to lean on. Even if Stephen Davis, who rushed for 1,444 yards this season, does not have a big day, the threat of the run should help keep Dallas's line from relentlessly hounding Delhomme.
The two defenses are superb. Dallas finished the regular season ranked No.1 in the league in total defense. Carolina was third.
In the teams' regular-season meeting, a 24-20 victory by the Cowboys on Nov. 23, Dallas held Davis to 59 yards rushing. Carter had one of his best games, throwing for 254 yards and only one interception.
