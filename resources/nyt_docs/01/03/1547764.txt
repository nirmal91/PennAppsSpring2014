An article on Dec. 6 about Wal-Mart's expansion into Mexico and a chart showing the company's worldwide reach referred imprecisely to its holdings. Some stores operate under other names, including Sam's Club; not all are called Wal-Mart.
Correction:  January 6, 2004, Tuesday  A chart on Dec. 6 showing Wal-Mart's worldwide reach, with an article about the company's expansion into Mexico, referred imprecisely to its holdings. Some stores operate under other names, including Sam's Club; not all are called Wal-Mart. (A correction in this space on Saturday attributed the error incorrectly to the article also.)
