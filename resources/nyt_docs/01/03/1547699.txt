Kellen Winslow II, who won the John Mackey Award emblematic of college football's top tight end, announced Friday that he would forgo his senior season to enter the N.F.L. draft.
Winslow's departure did not come as a surprise to those close to Miami's program. He had a controversy-dotted junior season and did not hide his desire to move on.
Winslow, the son of the Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow, is the third Hurricane to decide to leave early. After Miami's 16-14 victory over Florida State Thursday night in the Orange Bowl, safety Sean Taylor and defensive tackle Vince Wilfork declared their intention to enter the draft.
''I kind of left it up to them,'' Miami Coach Larry Coker said. ''It's their careers. But Kellen is going to go and should go.''
Winslow, 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds, caught 60 passes this season for 605 yards and one touchdown. In the Orange Bowl, he had 5 catches for 48 yards. ''He has wide receiver skills in a tight end's body,'' Coker said.
Winslow called himself the Chosen One before the season and drew the coaching staff's ire by striking a Heisman Trophy pose after scoring in the opener. Later, he was benched to start a game after drawing several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. He was also criticized for denouncing officials and comparing the game to war after a loss to Tennessee.
