The Islanders, who are already without one of their leading scorers, added right wing Mark Parrish to their list of injured players yesterday. Parrish will miss eight weeks with a severely sprained left ankle. He was hurt in a collision with Ottawa's Chris Phillips in the first period Thursday night.
Parrish is tied for second on the team with 13 goals, including 5 in the five games since Aleksei Yashin was injured. Yashin (12 goals, 12 assists) is out for at least another two months with torn wrist tendons.
The Islanders (19-16-2-1) play tonight at Boston (15-11-9-4). Center Michael Peca is expected back after missing a game because of a strained groin muscle. Goaltender Rick DiPietro has been recalled from Bridgeport of the American Hockey League.
