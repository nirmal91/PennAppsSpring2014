To the Editor:
Re ''Thurmond's Secret and Its Legacy'' (letters, Dec. 31):
A letter writer praises Essie Mae Washington-Williams, the black daughter of Senator Strom Thurmond, for her ''decency and fortitude in keeping the secret, thus protecting her father, until many months after his death, when it could produce no embarrassment and do no harm to his political career.''
Where would civil rights be today if Rosa Parks had had the ''decency and fortitude'' not to make a fuss?
