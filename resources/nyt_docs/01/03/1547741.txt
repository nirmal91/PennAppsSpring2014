To the Editor:
In your wish involving the No Child Left Behind Act (''New Year's Wishes, Revised,'' editorial, Jan. 1), you ask the Bush administration to become serious about having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. That is a necessary request.
You also note that ''there has always been a danger that the program will be too much about testing and too little about teaching.'' Said another way, there is too much focus on teaching to the test and too little on learning. As a teacher, I know that when the focus in schools is on enhancing learning skills, there is less talk about poor grades.
For any approach to education to be efficient, the nature of how people learn must first be taken into consideration. Learning, not just information, must be at the heart of a lesson.
