A Brooklyn teenager was arrested yesterday in connection with the city's first reported killing of 2004, the police said, and he was charged with second-degree murder.
Nehru Gumbs, 18, who lives in the Kingsborough Houses, was also charged with weapons possession, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said, in the Thursday shooting death of Tralane Walker, 25.
On Wednesday evening, Mr. Gumbs argued on the street in Canarsie with another man over a woman and then left, returning with a gun, the police said. About 1:10 a.m. on Thursday, he began firing the gun, missing his intended target and striking Mr. Walker, a nurse's aide in an Endicott, N.Y., home for the aged.
It is unclear where Mr. Walker was in relation to the man with whom Mr. Gumbs is said to have argued.
Mr. Walker had just come from church, his family said, and was walking across the street to greet a friend when he was shot in the head.
Mr. Gumbs was set to appear in court on Monday, the district attorney's spokesman said.
