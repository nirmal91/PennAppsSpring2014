To the Editor:
Paul Krugman hits the mark once again in ''Who's Nader Now?'' (column, Jan. 2). It has amazed me that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Senator John Kerry and Representative Richard A. Gephardt have found it so easy to attack Howard Dean's electability without addressing their own significant problems in that area.
The attacks on Dr. Dean will not cause his supporters to abandon their largely ''anybody but Bush'' leanings, but it would be an advantage for any Democrat to have their full support (and contributions).
