To the Editor:
I wholeheartedly agree with ''Critique From 50's Wellesley Grads'' (Arts pages, Dec. 29), taking issue with the portrayal of the college as an elitist finishing school in the movie ''Mona Lisa Smile.''
I majored in art history at Wellesley (class of 1952), and like the Julia Roberts character, I taught art history there in the 1950's. The film's depiction of art history at Wellesley in the 1950's demeans not only its many serious students but also the department's rigorous curriculum and learned professors.
The professors did not urge students to marry after graduation; in my experience, they were effective role models for professional careers in the field.
In spite of the lip service paid to proto-feminism, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' does not have a feminist agenda. The film's distortions should be understood in the context of today's political climate, in particular the backlash against the feminist movement.
In 2002, a representative of the two female producers asked me to be a consultant on the film. When I asked to be paid a modest fee for my time and expertise, I was told that the budget didn't allow ''money for research.'' This from the producers of a multimillion-dollar film!
