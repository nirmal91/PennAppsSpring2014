An article on Dec. 11 about a symposium at Lincoln Center on jazz and American democracy misstated a word in a quotation from Bill Clinton, a panelist. After Wynton Marsalis said he had been up late the night before drinking vodka with the saxophonist Igor Butman, Mr. Clinton said: ''Why didn't you call me? I like him better than you do'' -- not ''I like it.''
