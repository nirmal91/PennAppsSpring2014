The Jets are expected to interview the former Buffalo coach Gregg Williams for their vacant defensive coordinator job. Williams, who earned his reputation during four years as Tennessee's defensive coordinator, was fired by the Bills this week.
The Jets have requested permission to speak to Tampa Bay's defensive line coach, Rod Marinelli; Tennessee's linebackers coach, Gunther Cunningham; and Philadelphia's linebackers coach, Ron Rivera.
Tampa Bay will interview Mike Tannenbaum, the Jets' assistant general manager and salary-cap expert, for their general manager's job. The Bucs offered him the same position two years ago, but he decided to stay in New York.
