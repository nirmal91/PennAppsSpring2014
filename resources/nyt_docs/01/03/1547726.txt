To the Editor:
Re ''Who's Nader Now?,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 2):
Thoughtful, substantive candidates like Senator John Kerry -- someone not only electable, but with the vision and expertise to be a first-rate president -- have good cause to question the electability of Howard Dean, whose misstatements and gaffes, obvious political immaturity and months of negative remarks about his fellow Democrats have already provided a year's worth of television ads for the Republican National Committee.
I hope that the Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire will have the good sense to base their primary choices on substance rather than hype in this very important election.
