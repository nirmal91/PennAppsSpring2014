To the Editor:
''Marketing Strategy Splits the Sacred and Secular'' (front page, Dec. 27) describes a publisher's resistance to publishing the book ''Circle of Grace'' under its religious imprint because a female character becomes an Episcopal priest.
Huh? Last I heard, Episcopalians still considered themselves Christians. So how does an Episcopal priest make a book un-Christian?
The answer, of course, is that your article is actually talking not about a Christian market but about an evangelical Christian market. And when most evangelical Christians use the word ''Christian,'' they aren't talking about Episcopalians or other mainstream Christians. They're talking only about themselves.
But Christians, like followers of all religions, come in many flavors. That evangelicals claim the sole right to the word Christian is no reason for you to grant it to them.
