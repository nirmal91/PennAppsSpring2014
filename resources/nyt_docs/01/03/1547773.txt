Wide right. Again. It has become a glaringly redundant way for the Florida State Seminoles to lose to the University of Miami and one of most bizarre footnotes in college football.
When Xavier Beitia's 39-yard field goal attempt faded late in Thursday night's Orange Bowl, it marked the fourth time since 1991 that F.S.U. has lost to Miami on a wide-right field-goal attempt.
Throw in a wide-left loss last season, and that is five games in 13 seasons the Seminoles have lost against Miami because of errant kicks. One of them, in 1991, cost F.S.U. a chance at a national title. In 2000, the Seminoles managed to overcome a kick-induced Miami loss only to lose the national title game to Oklahoma.
It is enough to make F.S.U. Coach Bobby Bowden, the winningest coach in Division I-A history, scratch his head and presumably keep on scratching it until his hair starts falling out.
''I don't know of any rivalry in the nation where so many of the games came down to a missed kick, and I said that three kicks ago,'' Bowden said after the 16-14 loss at Pro Player Stadium. ''I have a hard time understanding it.''
Bowden, 8-14 against Miami since the Hurricanes won their first national title in 1983, was worrying how Seminoles alumni would feel about him losing five consecutive games to Miami. Now, however reluctantly, he has a curse theory to offer.
Beitia, the son of a Spanish jai alai player, becomes the only kicker to be victimized twice, and he has another year of eligibility. The teams open next season on Sept. 6 when Miami makes its debut in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Beitia offered some unwitting but refreshing variety last season when his 43-yard miss sailed wide left. The Seminoles lost, 28-27.
''I thought it was good,'' he said of Thursday's miss. ''Usually when I miss, I don't hit it as well as this one. I kicked it right over the right upright.''
Not exactly. The kick was off line at least several yards. Wide right.
