To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (''Who's Nader Now?,'' column, Jan. 2) has succinctly conveyed what many Democrats have been brooding -- and cringing -- over for months.
Viciously attacking any Democratic primary candidate, particularly one who may win the nomination, splinters the party and offers the Bush political machine free ammunition.
I am relieved that Howard Dean and Gen. Wesley K. Clark have avoided these irresponsible tactics -- one reason that both campaigns are thriving.
