To the Editor:
Re ''New Year's Wishes, Revised'' (editorial, Jan. 1):
It is sad to see that the world is not a better place since your last New Year's wishes.
The plight of the Palestinians, which must be resolved as a precondition to ending world terrorism, is the same as it was a year ago.
Poverty and unnecessary death due to starvation, disease and violence are on the rise, and an act of aggression by one of the world's democratic leaders that was to solve all the world's problems has only compounded them, and divided the world as never before.
