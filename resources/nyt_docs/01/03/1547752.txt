A Staten Island math teacher was arrested in Brooklyn yesterday on drug and weapons charges, according to the police.
Narcotics detectives said they saw the teacher, Dennis Loffredo, 50, sitting in the back seat of a parked S.U.V. at the corner of 57th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway about 4:20 p.m. Mr. Loffredo, who lives on Staten Island and teaches at Tottenville High School, was making what appeared to be a drug purchase, according to the police.
The detectives found 51 grams of cocaine and a 9 mm. pistol in the car. The police arrested Mr. Loffredo and two other men who were also in the car, the police said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education, Margie Feinberg, said Mr. Loffredo would be removed from the classroom and assigned to an administrative job until his case is decided.
''Depending on what happens, he's likely to face disciplinary action,'' Ms. Feinberg said.
The two other men in the car, Richard Orlando, 22, and his half brother Raymond Cappola, 17, both live at 184 Connecticut Street on Staten Island, the police said.
