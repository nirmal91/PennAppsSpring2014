Gen. Wesley K. Clark played down the possibility of joining a Dean ticket on Friday, saying, ''I'm not going to be Howard Dean's Dick Cheney.''
General Clark said the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was a two-man contest between himself and Dr. Dean, a former Vermont governor, adding that of the two only he had the foreign policy experience necessary to be president.
The implicit criticism of Dr. Dean was unusual for General Clark.
In remarks after a campaign event here, the general said President Bush, another former governor, was ''unlearned and inexperienced in foreign affairs'' when he took office. ''He tried to reassure the American people by having a lot of highly experienced and competent advisers around him,'' the general said, speaking of President Bush. ''We see the results, right now.''
General Clark has previously said that Dr. Dean ''dangled'' the vice-presidential spot in a meeting last summer before General Clark entered the race. Dr. Dean denied making such an offer.
