To the Editor:
Re ''Squished Cupcakes and Polls,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 25):
Ms. Dowd describes Howard Dean and his wife, Judith, as seemingly ''so far from mainstream American life and so disconnected from each other's careers'' as to be unreal.
Having been raised by two devoted practicing physicians, I am bewildered by Ms. Dowd's repeated assertion that Judith Steinberg Dean's dedication to her career is somehow a reflection of a bizarre relationship with her husband.
My parents successfully raised four daughters. Moreover, one of my sisters and her husband are both physicians and have a fantastic relationship despite their long working hours on call, with patients and in the operating room.
In everything I've read or seen about the Deans, there is evidence of respect, support, admiration and, yes, love.
