President Hamid Karzai signed Afghanistan's new Constitution at a ceremony in Kabul, in the presence of the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah -- now formally the Father of the Nation -- cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats. The Constitution became law immediately. It was approved by a loya jirga, or grand council, on Jan. 4. Mr. Karzai also offered prayers that the Constitution would guide the way to national unity and democracy.
