To the Editor:
In ''Kerry's Good Intentions'' (column, Jan. 24), David Brooks writes that Senator John Kerry has an occasional daring idea but inevitably succumbs to the cant of his core constituency.
Mr. Brooks should look more closely in his own camp.
If the discontinuity between speech and action is, as he says, the difference between speechifying and leadership, he has described with great accuracy the political limitations of George W. Bush.
