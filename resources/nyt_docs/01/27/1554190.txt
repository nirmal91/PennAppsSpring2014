Dennis J. Kucinich  'This is a 50-state race. We're going all the way.'
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio visited with the employees of a soon-to-be-closed frozen-food plant at 6 a.m. on Monday and then walked with newspaper workers from The Manchester Union Leader who are negotiating a new contract.
The march at the newspaper workers' union office, designed to emphasize Mr. Kucinich's sympathy with labor, was long enough for the television cameras but short enough that his driver did not bother to turn off the minivan's engine.
Mr. Kucinich's New Hampshire campaign has been a haphazard collection of last-minute appearances, house parties and hastily arranged interviews. In contrast to Iowa, where hundreds of state residents often showed up at his speeches, events here often draw more people from out of state than from New Hampshire.
In some ways, Mr. Kucinich's campaign has become a magnet for sojourners from around the country. He is trailed by a multicolored bus that looks as if it made a trip to the 1960's and back. Its passengers were out organizing on his behalf on Monday.
And a husband-and-wife team of red-haired rappers from California has spent their honeymoon following Mr. Kucinich.
But with polls showing him in the low single digits, local reporters have been more focused on Mr. Kucinich's demise than on his platform, which includes proposals for a Department of Peace and universal health care.
Mr. Kucinich brushed away questions about any plans to withdraw from the presidential race. ''This is a 50-state race. We're going all the way,'' he said.
Indeed, his last scheduled campaign stop for Monday was not in New Hampshire at all, but in Portland, Maine.
