To the Editor:
William Safire (''The Kennedy Comeback,'' column, Jan. 26) accuses Senators John Kerry and John Edwards of promoting class warfare. Mr. Safire's response to those who want to underscore social and economic inequities in America is to charge them with political opportunism.
The truth is that there is an undeclared war between the haves and have-nots in this country, and Mr. Safire needn't blame the candidates for how they identify a worsening imbalance.
The rich are getting richer, and the poor poorer. It a regrettable fact of American life, and it's a subject that begs for debate and political leadership.
