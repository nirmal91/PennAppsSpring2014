To the Editor:
I read Gregory Jaynes's Jan. 24 Op-Ed article, ''A Sorry State of Affairs,'' three times and laughed aloud each time.
Here's another example of how those in authority (including President Bush's government) are logical thinkers:
A friend of mine pulled into the library parking lot at 7 a.m. to return a book. Since the library was closed, he left his car parked horizontally, engine running, to run to the book chute.
In the several seconds that he was gone, a police car pulled up, and the officer wrote him a ticket for $100. Apparently my friend was blocking two handicapped spots.
My friend protested, of course. His was the only car in the lot, he pointed out. Tough, said the cop. The ticket was paid.
