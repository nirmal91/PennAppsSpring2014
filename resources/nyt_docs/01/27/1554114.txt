Japan's merchandise trade surplus grew 41 percent in December, to 1.1 trillion yen ($10.6 billion), as strong exports to China and elsewhere offset the effect of the yen's appreciation. The sixth consecutive monthly expansion in the surplus came partly as a result of an 8.5 percent jump in exports, including a 32 percent rise in shipments to China. At the same time, Japan's surplus with the United States fell for the 12th consecutive month as Japanese automakers and other producers build more of their goods in North America. Exports from Japan to the United States fell 7.8 percent.
