''The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women,'' edited by Dr. Lauren Slater, Dr. Jessica Henderson Daniel and Dr. Amy Elizabeth Banks. Beacon Press, $24.95.
Why women's mental health? Why not just general mental health?
The answer, the authors of this home reference conclude, is that men and women are different, in mind, body and psyche.
''They are different in hormonal development, in brain development, in physiological development and in social development,'' they say. Add to that the fact that models of female psychological development are for the most part male, and the authors' contention that ''we have been overlooked'' appears to be well founded.
The book is a collection of observations by psychologists and psychiatrists. Among the many topics covered are postpartum depression, menopause, aging and its effects on mood and memory, why women are at greater risk for developing schizophrenia in midlife or old age, issues of sexuality, women of color and relationships, domestic violence, and afflictions from addiction to eating disorders.
We learn that little is known about what a ''normal'' female sexual response is, that women exposed to trauma develop later problems at rates higher than men, and that depression in women strikes earlier than in men.
The book provides valuable advice on drug and other treatment options, exercise and physical activity, how to find and choose a therapist, and what questions to ask a psychiatrist.
