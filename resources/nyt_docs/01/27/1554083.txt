To the Editor:
Re ''A Sorry State of Affairs,'' by Gregory Jaynes (Op-Ed, Jan. 24):
Mr. Jaynes's thoughts on his life provoked by President Bush's State of the Union address seem to be an apt illustration of the texture of society today.
Much of our existence consists of efforts aimed at making sure that things don't go wrong, fall apart, break down or stop running until a decent interval has elapsed after their manufacture or installation.
Life in the United States is growing more formal and impersonal, as well as inefficient. Thanks to computer-mediated services, small companies and agencies down to the neighborhood hardware store can emulate the bureaucratic style of vast corporations by blaming their computer system for their mistakes.
Bureaucratic modes of behavior and thought in everyday life have become as American as apple pie.
