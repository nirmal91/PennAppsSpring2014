A security guard for the Department of Homeless Services was arrested early yesterday and charged with raping a woman in a Brooklyn homeless shelter for women, the police said.
The guard, Jason Williams, 27, was charged with raping a 27-year-old homeless woman at a shelter at 116 Williams Avenue in Brownsville, the police said. Mr. Williams contended that the woman consented to the encounter, which took place in a bathroom at 3 a.m. on Sunday, officials said.
A woman who answered the phone at a listing for Mr. Williams in the Bronx refused to comment. Another woman, who identified herself as his mother, said she would not speak about the charges against him ''until I find out the facts.''
A Police Department spokesman, citing a police report on the incident, said that Mr. Williams had followed the woman into the bathroom and ''forcibly removed her sweat pants and underwear.''
The woman, whose name was not released by the police, reported the rape to authorities at the shelter, and they called the police. The woman had been living at the shelter on a long-term basis, an official at the Department of Homeless Services said.
A department spokesman said Mr. Williams would be suspended. Mr. Williams had been a Homeless Services employee since 1998, an official in the department said. It is unusual for a city employee to be charged with so serious a crime, the police spokesman said.
Charges against city employees often involve domestic disputes or driving while intoxicated, he said.
