To the Editor:
Re ''Adieu, New Hampshire'' (editorial, Jan. 24):
For every broadcast from a town hall meeting and for every house party that looks like a reality TV show, there are tenfold other gatherings around this ''small, cold state'' involving real candidates and real people.
In the course of one recent week, for example, I passed Joe Lieberman walking in a town square, Wes Clark standing in front of a local cafe and John Edwards talking to a gathering crowd in my neighbor's driveway. If there was media involvement, it was modest at best.
Back in 1976, a Democratic activist asked a woman whether she was going to vote for one of the candidates for president, Mo Udall.
''I don't know yet,'' was the reply. ''I've only met him twice.''
We still honor that anecdote in New Hampshire, because retail politics here is more vital and important than ever today.
