To the Editor:
In ''The Kennedy Comeback'' (column, Jan. 26), William Safire writes: ''Class warfare may work in primaries but tends to backfire in the general election. Would it work for Kerry-Edwards? Ask Al Gore.''
I presume he thinks the answer is no, it won't. But if you listen to the majority of American voters, it ''worked'' and the message was sound. Let's not forget which party and which candidate got the majority of the popular vote in the last presidential election.
''Class warfare'' seems to be the right's latest mantra in an attempt to keep fairness in America out of the national debate. Mr. Safire, we're all in this together.
