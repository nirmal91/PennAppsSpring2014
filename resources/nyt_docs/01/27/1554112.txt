To the Editor:
Re ''Subconsciously, Athletes May Play Like Statisticians'' (Jan. 20): Bayesian analysis is similar to psychoanalytic theory in that subconscious perceptions of the past determine, in large part, how we react and behave.
Psychoanalytic treatment is based on understanding how the past influences the present as a way of avoiding ''self-destructive mistakes.''
Thus, an athlete who is freed from unconscious conflict about competition can depend more reliably on strategic, subconscious decisions.
