There is no good answer to why Timothy Stansbury Jr. was shot to death by a police officer on a rooftop of the Louis Armstrong Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn. Mr. Stansbury, 19 years old, black and unarmed, was killed when he happened upon two white officers on patrol as he tried to open the door to the roof. This is more than a case of wrong place, wrong time.
While the police and the Brooklyn district attorney conduct their investigations, the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, quickly told the public that the shooting appeared to be unjustified. His announcement is consistent with how previous police missteps have been handled in Michael Bloomberg's administration -- with an openness that was absent when Rudolph Giuliani was mayor.
No one disputes that Mr. Stansbury was simply taking a well-traveled route between buildings to make his way to a party. He posed no danger. By all indications, the same cannot be said of the police officer who fired, identified as Richard Neri Jr.
As he and his partner made the rounds of the buildings -- a procedure known as a vertical patrol -- his gun was drawn, even though it appears that the men were not responding to any specific threat that night. That is not against regulations, but it is one area that needs scrutiny in the internal review.
While both officers were veterans of vertical patrols, the rooftops of the housing project can be perilous. They provide a convenient escape route for criminals who like to conduct business -- robberies, assaults and drug deals -- on the darkened top-floor landings of the stairwells. Last year, criminals shot five people at the project.
The challenge for Mr. Kelly is to make sure that the officers checking out the roofs are prepared for anything, including the possibility that the people they encounter are not a threat.
