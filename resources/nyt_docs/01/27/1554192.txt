The Mets traded pitchers with the Royals yesterday, acquiring a right-handed minor league starter, Shawn Sedlacek, and giving up a left-handed reliever, Jaime Cerda. The Mets are still seeking a fifth starter, and Sedlacek will attend spring training as a nonroster invitee, although he is a long shot to make the team in any capacity. Sedlacek, 27, went 4-11 with a 6.45 earned run average for Class AA Omaha last season and was 3-5 with a 6.72 E.R.A. for the Royals in 2002. Cerda was deemed expendable in a Mets bullpen already secured with the left-handers John Franco and Mike Stanton, and he would have been competing for a long reliever role. He was 1-1 with no saves and a 5.85 E.R.A. in 27 games over 32 1/3 innings last season.
