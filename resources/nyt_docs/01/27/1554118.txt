The Brazilian unit of Parmalat hired a corporate turnaround specialist to help overhaul its money-losing operations, the company said. Afonso Champi, a Parmalat spokesman here, said Claudio Galeazzi, a consultant who has previously helped to rework the finances of Lojas Americanas and Vila Romana, two well-known Brazilian retail chains, and Mococa, another dairy company, started work as part of an agreement between Parmalat and its local creditors. Mr. Galeazzi should lend credibility to Parmalat's management, which is trying to keep its day-to-day operations running without any backing from banks, Mr. Champi said. Like its Italian parent, Parmalat's Brazilian unit operated under two sets of rules, one for its listed operational unit, which owes local banks $160 million, and another more byzantine set of practices used by its two holding companies under direct control of the Tanzi family in Parma. Bankers say the total owed by the two Brazilian holding companies, which were involved in financing acquisitions in the 1990's and Parmalat's expensive sports marketing and soccer interests, could exceed $1.6 billion.
