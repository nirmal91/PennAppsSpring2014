Carolina running back Stephen Davis completed practice in Houston on Monday and is expected to be at full strength on Sunday despite the left quadriceps injury he sustained in a National Football Conference divisional playoff game against the Rams on Jan. 10.
''Stephen will be full speed,'' Panthers Coach John Fox said.
Davis, who rushed for a career-high 1,444 yards this season, shared the workload with DeShaun Foster in Carolina's 14-3 victory over Philadelphia on Jan. 18 in the N.F.C. title game.
Davis had 19 carries for 76 yards. Foster rushed 14 times for 60 yards and a touchdown.
Fox said Davis would receive a majority of the practice snaps this week.
