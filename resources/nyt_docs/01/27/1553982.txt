Technicolor Dreams
Q. Why do some people dream in color and others in black and white?
A. Some people report dreaming in color, some say their dreams are in black and white, and some say they experience both kinds of dreams. But most sleep researchers now say that most if not all people dream in color, during the rapid eye movement, or REM, phase of sleep. Some suggest that those who say they never do may have lost the evanescent memory of their colored dreams, or may not find color important enough to remember.
Some researchers even suggest that the idea of dreaming in black and white did not occur until people had black and white movies, television and photographs to compare with the real world.
A well-known 1942 study in which most subjects reported dreaming in black and white could not be replicated last year by researchers at the University of California, who said, ''It appears that one or the other (or both) groups of respondents must be profoundly mistaken about a basic feature of their dream experiences.'' Only about 18 percent of the 2003 study's subjects said they rarely or never dreamed in color, against about 71 percent in 1942.
In a poll being taken on his Web site by Dr. Eric H. Chudler, a psychologist at the University of Washington, 61 percent of the thousands who responded said they always dreamed in color, 31 percent said they sometimes did and 7 percent said they never did.
