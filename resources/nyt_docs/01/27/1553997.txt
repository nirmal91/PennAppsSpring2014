''Hysterectomy: Exploring Your Options,'' by Dr. Edward E. Wallach and Dr. Esther Eisenberg. Johns Hopkins University Press, $16.95.
More than a fifth of all American women have had surgery to remove the uterus, to treat a variety of painful medical disorders. Many of the women are in the prime of life when they have the hysterectomy, the authors of this valuable reference guide point out, with the median age 40.9.
Is the drastic operation, which is one of the most contentious medical issues, often performed unnecessarily? Are there alternatives? Is the operation's effect on a woman's emotions and sexuality worth it? The authors, who are specialists in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, offer a balanced view.
They also provide information that includes the anatomy of the uterus, technical details of the operation, tips for finding the right doctor and other treatment approaches. They discuss hormone replacement therapy, whether and when to remove the ovaries, and what a woman can expect afterward.
''We don't want to scare women out of hysterectomy if it is the best treatment for their condition,'' they write, ''but neither do we want to sell it as a cure-all for their problems.''
As a counterpoint, though, they also say women should not continue to suffer from many disorders because they refuse to undergo a hysterectomy under almost any circumstances. If other, less invasive and effective treatments are available, including laparoscopic or laser techniques, the authors suggest trying those procedures first. ''When other options fail, however, hysterectomy may be the solution,'' they say.
