America Online in Dulles, Va., part of Time Warner, is dividing its interactive account, with billings estimated at $55 million to $60 million, between two New York agencies.
Atmosphere, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, will continue to handle strategic and creative duties, as it has since July. Digitas will handle online media buying and planning, which had been handled by Doner in Southfield, Mich., on a project basis. Digitas will work on some creative tasks. The decision came after a two-month review, managed by Goodman &amp; Company in New York, that had been narrowed to Atmosphere, Digitas and Modem Media in Norwalk, Conn.
