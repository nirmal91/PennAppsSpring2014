To the Editor:
Supporters of human settlements on the Moon and Mars confuse technological capabilities with purpose (''New Moon'').
The Moon is littered with debris from the Apollo program because there simply aren't enough good reasons for humans to be there.
The price of the newest initiative includes consigning the wonderfully productive Hubble Space Telescope to an early death. Sadly, the new space plan is already glistening with flop sweat.
