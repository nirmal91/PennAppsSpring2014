Giants Coach Tom Coughlin added four more coaches to his staff Monday, including Kevin Gilbride as quarterbacks coach. Gilbride is a longtime offensive coordinator who served that role for Coughlin for two seasons at Jacksonville.
Gilbride spent the past two seasons directing the Bills' offense, which was ranked 11th in the league in 2002 but struggled last season.
Coughlin also named Pat Flaherty as offensive line coach. He was the Bears' tight ends coach the past three seasons. Dave DeGuglielmo was hired as an assistant offensive line/quality control coach, and David Merritt was named a defensive assistant/quality control coach.
Coughlin has filled almost all his positions, with a notable exception: offensive coordinator, a job Coughlin may fill himself. He has said that he will not decide if he will call the plays until after his staff has been hired.
