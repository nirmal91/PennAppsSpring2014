Prime Minister José María Aznar called for the resignation of a top minister in the Catalonia regional government for holding secret talks with the outlawed Basque separatist group E.T.A. The minister, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, the second-ranking official in the regional Parliament, said he had held the talks in an attempt to have the Basque group declare a truce in its violent campaign for an independent homeland.
