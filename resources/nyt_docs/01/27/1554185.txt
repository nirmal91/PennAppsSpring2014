Donnie Henderson so impressed Jets Coach Herman Edwards during his interview in the early stages of the search for a defensive coordinator that every other candidate was compared to him after that.
Henderson had never been a coordinator, but he moved to first on Edwards's list from third. On Monday, after a monthlong search, the Jets announced that Henderson, who had coached the Ravens' secondary since 1999, had the job.
When asked about his style, Henderson said, ''It will be tough love.''
The Ravens were fourth against the pass in 2003, and Henderson shares Edwards's enthusiasm for an aggressive style.
The Jets are likely to have significant personnel turnover on defense.
