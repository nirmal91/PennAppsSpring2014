Despite the well-established risks of mixing alcohol and prescription pain relievers, many people with chronic back pain continue to drink while taking the drugs, researchers have found.
''The use of medication in relationship to alcohol consumption is of immediate clinical concern,'' the researchers, from the University of Michigan Medical Center, wrote in the December issue of the journal Disability and Rehabilitation. ''Although manufacturer instructions warn about interactions between alcohol and opioids, there is no evidence here that heavy drinkers (or their prescribing doctors) take heed.''
The study, led by Dr. Ethan A. Booker, is based on assessments of patients who visited the hospital's spine center over two years. The patients, 147 men and 136 women, were asked about their use of prescription drugs and alcohol and were given physical examinations.
Eighty-five percent of the men said they had as many as 5 alcoholic drinks a week. Ten men said they had 6 to 11, and 10 said they had 12 or more. Yet many of the patients were taking drugs whose effects can be heightened by alcohol.
Among the women, three-quarters said they did not drink at all, and the rest said they had no more than five drinks a week, but the doctors said they were skeptical about some of those claims.
The study suggests that doctors treating people with chronic pain need to make a point of asking them about their alcohol use.
''Doctors tend not to ask all the important questions, and patients tend to conceal or not consider their heavy alcohol use,'' said a co-author of the study, Dr. Andrew J. Haig.
