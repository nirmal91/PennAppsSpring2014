To the Editor:
The tendency for pharmaceutical companies to ''detail'' medical residents is disconcerting; I would like to have confidence in the prescriptions my doctor writes for me (''Drug Companies Get Too Close'').
But I am troubled by another marketing technique drug companies use that the article did not mention: giving free drug samples to doctors who then hand them out to their patients. My doctor has given me enough of these for a complete course of treatment.
I appreciate this, but often wonder whether he gave them to me because it was the best medication for my ailment, or simply because they were sitting in his closet.
