The Raiders' owner, Al Davis, hired Norv Turner to be Oakland's coach on Monday, ending his monthlong search for a top offensive mind to lead a team that went from the Super Bowl in 2003 to 4-12 this season.
Davis said he was close to hiring the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, last week, but had to make good on a promise to the former Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson that he would interview Turner before making a decision.
Turner, the Miami Dolphins' offensive coordinator the last two seasons, grew up a Raiders fan in nearby Martinez.
Turner, 51, replaces Bill Callahan, who was fired after two seasons.
Terms of his multiyear contract were not disclosed.
''I belong here,'' Turner said. ''When I got off the plane the other night, I felt like I was coming home.''
Before coaching the Redskins to a 49-59-1 record from 1994 to 2000, Turner won two Super Bowls as Johnson's offensive coordinator. ''Norv has been a tremendous offensive coach, and it is vital to the Raiders to have one man calling the plays from the sideline,'' Davis said. ''We had some flare-ups last year with plays not coming in on time from the sidelines.''
Turner inherits two quarterbacks coming off injury in Rich Gannon and Marques Tuiasosopo and a solid stable of running backs in Charlie Garner, Tyrone Wheatley and Justin Fargas.
The team must still decide if it wants to keep the aging receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown.
ROUNDUP: N.F.L.
