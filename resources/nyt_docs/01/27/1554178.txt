A justice of the State Supreme Court in Suffolk County, John C. Bivona, was reprimanded by the state for inappropriately issuing an order in a civil suit against the publicist Elizabeth S. Grubman as a favor to a friend, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct said yesterday. In December 2001, on a Saturday, the commission said, Christopher Modelewski, the lawyer for a bouncer who had sued Ms. Grubman for backing her S.U.V. into him at a Hamptons nightclub, went to Justice Bivona's home and asked for an order postponing some depositions that Ms. Grubman's lawyers had scheduled. The justice, who in addition to being Mr. Modelewski's friend was a client of his in a separate case, complied. He was not the judge handling the Grubman case, but was on call to handle after-hours motions. The commission said that because of his relationship with Mr. Modelewski, he should not have become involved.
