Andre Agassi is in the semifinals of the Australian Open, and he still hasn't lost a set. On Tuesday, he only had to win one in his quarterfinal match against ninth-seeded SÃ©bastien Grosjean of France before Grosjean retired with a strained right groin muscle at 6-2, 2-0.
At age 33, it never hurts to conserve energy, and Agassi now has an excellent chance of feeling fresh for his next match against the winner of Tuesday's second quarterfinal match between top-seeded Andy Roddick and Marat Safin. ''They are both phenomenal talents,'' Agassi said.
Grosjean was left saying the same sorts of things about Agassi, the defending champion. Though he beat him twice in 2001, Grosjean has lost three consecutive matches to him. Agassi, seeded fourth, took command of Tuesday's match from the beginning.
Grosjean walked to the net and surrendered in the second set. ''You just don't want any match to end that way,'' said Agassi, who has won 26 straight matches here.
