The last polls in New Hampshire close at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, and if history is a guide, almost all of the state's 301 precincts will have reported results by 10 p.m.
But a sophisticated television viewer may be able to discern the outcome of the Democratic primary by early afternoon. That is when the first results of surveys of voters leaving the polls are available.
The television stations and networks are committed not to announce winners and losers until after 8 p.m. But much can be learned from inflections in the announcers' voices and hints in their reporting. Television announcers are not likely to suggest a close fight, for instance, if the exit polls show a blowout.
The New Hampshire secretary of state, William M. Gardner, said Monday that he expected 184,000 voters, the most since 1984, the last year when the Democratic primary was contested and the Republican one was not.
The survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania reported Monday that its polling suggested that nearly half of the voters in the Democratic primary would not be registered Democrats, but independents, who under state rules can vote in any primary.
Anyone can get on the ballot here by paying a $1,000 filing fee. So even though President Bush is essentially unopposed, there are 13 other names on the Republican primary ballot, running from Blake Ashby of St. Louis to Bill Wyatt of Glendale, Calif.
A total of 23 people are on the Democratic ballot, including two candidates who have dropped out, Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Carol Moseley Braun.
