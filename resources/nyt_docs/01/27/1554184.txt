The former Giants coach Jim Fassel has been in discussions with Baltimore Coach Brian Billick about joining the Ravens' coaching staff next season, Billick said Monday.
''Obviously, if we can find the right parameters for Jim to join us, his credentials speak for themselves,'' Billick told reporters in Owings Mills, Md., on Monday. ''He's probably, next to Bill Walsh, in my opinion, one of the pre-eminent quarterback coaches in the game.''
Billick has a stable of young quarterbacks, including Anthony Wright, Kyle Boller and Chris Redman.
Fassel could not be reached for comment. If he sits out the 2004 season, he will collect $2.7 million from the Giants. If he joins the Ravens, the Giants will be responsible for the amount minus his new salary.
