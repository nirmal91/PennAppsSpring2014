Miramax Films in New York, part of the Walt Disney Company, and Mother, a creatively focused London agency that recently opened a New York office, said yesterday that they would collaborate on advertising, marketing, entertainment and branding projects.
Terms were not disclosed. Under the agreement, Mother will offer creative ideas to Miramax as a consultant on ads and marketing for films under the Miramax and Dimension Films banners. Also, Miramax will have a ''first look'' at any entertainment ideas from Mother, which could be developed into concepts for movies or television shows.
The deal is Miramax's first such agreement with an advertising agency and Mother's first with an advertiser. Miramax also has an entertainment-marketing agreement with the Coors Brewing division of the Adolph Coors Company.
