To help prevent skin cancer, doctors counsel their patients to keep a close watch on some types of moles. But for people with many moles, that may be hard.
Now researchers have found that when patients are given detailed photographs of their bodies, they are much better at spotting new moles and those that have changed in shape.
It is fairly common for dermatologists who treat patients with pigmented moles, known as atypical nevi, to take photographs for their own reference when patients come back for checkups. A change in shape in a mole can be a warning sign of melanoma.
Researchers from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York wanted to assess just how much the pictures could help patients during self-examinations. The findings appear in The Archives of Dermatology.
The researchers took pictures of 50 patients' backs, chests and abdomens. Using eyeliner, the researchers then went to work on the patients, altering the shape of some moles or adding artificial new ones. When the patients used the pictures as a reference, they scored 10 percent higher in discovering the moles that had changed than they did when they checked themselves without pictures.
The lead author of the study, Dr. Susan A. Oliveria, said most people had no need to have such photographs taken. But Dr. Oliveria said the pictures were useful for those at higher risk of skin cancer because of their large number of irregularly shaped moles.
''Providing patients with photographs may encourage patients to more carefully monitor their lesions and may enable patients to better detect suspicious changes in their lesions,'' the authors wrote.
