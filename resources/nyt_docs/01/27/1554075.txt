To the Editor:
Re ''Adieu, New Hampshire'' (editorial, Jan. 24):
Your contention that the New Hampshire primary has run its course is off base. We who live in this political Brigadoon have a unique opportunity to meet every candidate and make informed voting decisions.
Candidates began knocking on our doors last spring. I saw John Edwards in May, Howard Dean in June and Wes Clark a few days after he announced his candidacy last fall.
Our 18-year-old son, a first-time voter, has gotten to hear candidates before they hit the front page of your newspaper. In the fall of 1975, when I was 18, I sat and talked to Jimmy Carter one on one for 10 minutes.
Retail politics does work. We may not always choose the eventual nominee, but we are able to pass our perspective on to the rest of the country. We may be small, but we are well informed and take our responsibility seriously.
