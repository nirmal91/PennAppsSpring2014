To the Editor:
Re ''Electronic Voting: Maybe Someday'' (letters, Jan. 25):
One letter writer believes that we can trust paperless electronic voting because his bank does a good job of counting his money. But he receives receipts and monthly statements from his bank.
Without printed proof at the time of deposit, the bank could easily tell him that the $500 he deposited was actually only $20. And there would be no way to prove otherwise.
Likewise, all voters must have confirmation that their votes are recorded and counted properly.
