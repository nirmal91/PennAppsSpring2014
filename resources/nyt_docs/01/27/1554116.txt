The largest bank in Spain, Santander Central Hispano, said that it earned 2.6 billion euros ($3.24 billion) last year, an increase of 16.2 percent, despite a decline of nearly 15 percent in net interest income. The results surpassed analysts' expectations, even though the weak United States dollar and currency depreciation in Latin America hurt its interest income. The increase reflected growth in European retail banking; increased lending in Brazil, Chile and Mexico; and lower costs, the company said. The chairman, Emilio Bot√≠n, said that the bank had ''much room to grow'' in Europe and Latin America, but he ruled out large cross-border mergers. ''These operations do not create value for shareholders,'' he said.
