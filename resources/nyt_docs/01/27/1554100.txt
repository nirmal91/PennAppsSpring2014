Taking a page from Japan's human resource handbook, Fujitsu Ltd. will cut the salaries of around 14,000 managers to motivate them -- and their subordinates -- to work harder.
Fujitsu, one of the world's largest makers of computer and telecommunications equipment, hopes to return to a profit soon for the first time in three years. The company is betting that the pay cuts will push managers to rally rank-and-file workers in the remaining months of the fiscal year, which ends March 31.
The pay cuts, will be ''several percent'' from each paycheck and will start at the section chief level and go up, a spokeswoman for Fujitsu, Yuri Momomoto, said. The cuts will take effect from now to March. If Fujitsu meets its goal of 30 billion yen ($281.6 million) in profit for the year, the managers might have their full salaries restored, Ms. Momomoto said.
The pay cuts are not meant to meet any particular financial goal, she said, but rather to build a sense of urgency and team spirit. While the step might seem counterintuitive to American sensibilities, in Japan it makes sense. Workers here often feel a strong kinship to their employers, especially in times of crisis. Under this logic, employees will work harder if they see their managers making sacrifices for the sake of the group.
Top executives in Japan often volunteer to take temporary pay cuts when a company performs poorly or is embroiled in scandal, even if the executives are not directly responsible.
In Fujitsu's case, by forcing all managers, regardless of rank or division, to take pay cuts, the company can distribute the pain evenly and avoid blaming any one group for the company's shortcomings.
By cutting salaries, Fujitsu can also avoid eliminating jobs, a process that is complicated by Japan's labor laws.
