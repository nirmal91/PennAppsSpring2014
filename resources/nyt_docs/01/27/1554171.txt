A picture caption on Sunday about Dr. Mark B. McClellan, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, with an article about his agency's increasing boldness, referred incorrectly in some copies to the setting of a meeting between him and President Bush. It took place in the White House when Mr. McClellan was appointed, not at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
