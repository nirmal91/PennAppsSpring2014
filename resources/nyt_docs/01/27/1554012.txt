To the Editor:
Readers of Nicholas D. Kristof's columns about the Cambodian sex workers he has saved (Jan. 17, 21 and 24) should remember that the conditions that these young women suffer today are only a little more than 200 years in the past in the First World. Many 18th-century novels, especially those by Daniel Defoe and the Marquis de Sade, describe similarly cruel, unfair and routine fates for their heroines, Moll Flanders, Roxana and Justine.
What is shocking is that the ''enlightened West'' has so recently emerged from the same femaledestroying mindset as Mr. Kristof is finding in the third world. What is encouraging is that a mere 200 years has materially transformed the lives, and minds, of many women and men after eons of habitual human behavior.
Every bit of vigilance helps every newborn girl toward a decent life. I applaud his experiment and the columns that he has written about it.
