An army colonel convicted of ordering the assassination in 1990 of Myrna Mack, an anthropologist and human rights activist, remains a fugitive despite alerts to international law enforcement groups. Col. Juan Valencia Osorio, who belonged to a presidential intelligence unit linked to numerous rights abuses, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a landmark Supreme Court ruling last week. But rights monitors had worried that he would flee, since the police had been unable to enter his residence for two days after the ruling. At one point, a group of soldiers confronted police officers outside his home. When the police finally entered, the colonel had vanished.
