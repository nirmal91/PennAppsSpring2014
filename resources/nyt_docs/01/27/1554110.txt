To the Editor:
Re ''Drug Companies Get Too Close'' (Jan. 20): The article highlights the detrimental impact some pharmaceutical representatives are having on the doctor-patient relationship.
A growing number of medical students, like myself, are refusing to be bought by drug companies. It is pleasing, therefore, to read about residency programs that are limiting the amount of access these companies have to physicians in training.
When I begin applying to residency programs, I will look for those that emphasize the practice of medicine based upon evidence and experience, not gifts and gadgets.
