A justice of State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday invalidated a law passed by the City Council last year that would have prohibited the city from doing business with banks or other institutions that issue, purchase or invest in predatory loans, like high-cost home loans and loans made to people who have no ability to repay them. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had vetoed the bill, and the City Council overrode the veto, turning the bill into law. The court found that state laws pre-empt the law passed by the Council.
