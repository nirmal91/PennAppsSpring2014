To the Editor:
Re ''Here's News for Cowboys: Bandanna Can Be Religious'' (news article, Jan. 21): France's banning of the Muslim head scarf is throwing the baby out with the bath water. Free countries are about choice. This law takes that away.
The Muslim head scarf and veil promote modesty. The veil is not ''a militant sign that calls for militant countersigns,'' as France's minister of national education has described it. Militancy has no place in democracies.
Politicians need scapegoats. Muslims these days are convenient. But mainly I blame moderate Muslims. We've allowed our religion to be usurped by the extremists.
The sad thing now is, given the current mania, secret detentions and very liberal labeling of ''terrorists,'' it's scary to stand up, even if just to say ''calm down.''
