To the Editor:
I was shocked when Maureen Dowd wrote that Howard Dean ''was flashing his ankles, his old black socks threadbare above the heels, showing beneath the same old gray suit he wears day after day'' (''Squished Cupcakes and Polls,'' column, Jan. 25). I cannot imagine a president ready to release nuclear launching codes who is not impeccably dressed.
Sartorial splendor must always be considered an important qualification to a concerned electorate.
