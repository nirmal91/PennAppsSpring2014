Welch Foods in Concord, Mass., has named J. Walter Thompson in New York as the creative agency of record on its account, which had been handled for more than 20 years by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide and predecessor agencies. Billings were estimated at $20 million to $25 million.
The decision came after a two-month review, managed by Jones Lundin Beals in Chicago, that had been narrowed to Arnold, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas; Thompson; and Cramer-Krasselt in Chicago. Campaigns by Arnold for Welch's, the food processing and marketing arm of the National Grape Cooperative Association, featured commercials using child actors speaking to the camera. MPG in New York, also part of Havas, continues to handle media planning and buying for Welch.
