To the Editor:
Re ''New Moon: Planning the Return to Space'' (Jan. 20): Human exploration has almost always been driven by commerce, the search for trade or conquest to increase a nation's wealth. One notable exception was the space race in the 60's, which was inspired by competition with the Soviet Union.
Manned space missions are costly without return. Humans will seriously venture outward from Earth when there is money to be made by doing so.
How many ships to the New World would Spain have sent if all they returned with were rocks?
