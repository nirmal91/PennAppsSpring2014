The manager of a Manhattan real estate company pleaded guilty on Friday to illegally removing asbestos from an East Village building and dumping the contaminant into an open container on the street, officials said yesterday. The manager, Constantine Fotos, worked for Philips International Holding Corporation and was responsible for overseeing renovation and demolition work at 13-25 Astor Place in October 1998. Mr. Fotos faces prison and a $500,000 fine when he is sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan in April.
