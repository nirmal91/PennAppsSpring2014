A convicted sex offender was fatally shot early yesterday outside a building on Riverdale Avenue in Yonkers, the police said. The man, Richard Tunley, 50, died from multiple gunshot wounds, said Detective William Maher of the Yonkers Police Department. Mr. Tunley had been released from a prison in New York State in 2001, after serving time for third-degree rape, according to public records. The shooting took place at 4:30 a.m., Detective Maher said. Although no arrests had been made late last night, detectives on the case ''know who they are looking for,'' and ''are actively pursuing the suspect'' Detective Maher said.
