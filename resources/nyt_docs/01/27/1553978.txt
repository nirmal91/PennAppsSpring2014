Drinking water rich in minerals, or hard water, may play a role in reducing heart disease, Finnish researchers say.
The findings came as the researchers were looking for an explanation for longstanding differences in heart attack rates in different regions of Finland. The study, led by Dr. Anne Kousa of the Geological Survey of Finland, appears in The Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
Although heart attacks have been decreasing in Finland, the study said, they occur more frequently in the eastern part of the country than in the western and southern parts. The differences, the researchers wrote, ''cannot be explained by individual lifestyle or genetic factors alone.''
The study looked at heart attacks that occurred in almost 18,946 men, ages 35 to 74, in three different years. The researchers correlated the incidence of heart attack with the level of water hardness in their communities.
The study found that the degree of water hardness as measured by mineral presence correlated directly with a lowered risk of heart attacks. They also found that the presence of fluoride in the water might also reduce the risk, but that the presence of copper and iron might increase it.
