Children who do not eat breakfast are more likely to develop cavities than those who do, a new study reports.
And while cavities tend to be a bigger problem for poor children than for those who grow up in middle-class homes, in this case the trend does not hold up, the researchers wrote in The Journal of the American Dental Association.
''What is probably the most important finding is that in the more affluent families, the young kids are at much greater risk for tooth decay when they skip breakfast,'' said the lead author of the study, Dr. Bruce A. Dye, a dentist and an epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Those children were about three and half times as likely to have cavities as well-to-do children who ate breakfast, the study found. Children who did not eat five servings of fruit or vegetables a day were also at higher risk.
The findings are based on a study of the dental health of more than 4,000 children, ages 2 to 5, who took part in a broad federal health survey.
The children were given dental examinations and their parents were asked a series of questions about the eating habits of the children.
Over the past three decades, the study noted, tooth decay in American children has gone down significantly. But eating patterns have also changed, the researchers said.
Teenagers who skip breakfast are known to make up for it by eating snacks during the day, often those high in sugar, increasing their risk of cavities. The same may be true for the younger children looked at in the study, Dr. Dye said.
The researchers acknowledged that it might seem surprising that children from low-income families did not have the same dental problems, compared with their higher-income peers, when they were not given breakfast at home. But the lower-income children, they said, are often given breakfast in programs like Head Start.
