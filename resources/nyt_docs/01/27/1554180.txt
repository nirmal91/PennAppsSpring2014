Two corrections officers have been indicted and accused of smuggling goods to inmates housed in the county jail where they work, the State Division of Criminal Justice said yesterday. The accused were identified as Vincenzo A. Perricone, 25, of Burlington, and James H. Dowd, 27, of Lumberton, who are stationed at the Burlington County Jail. A grand jury indictment, handed up on Friday, accused Mr. Dowd of smuggling in marijuana, prepaid cellphones and alcohol. Mr. Perricone was accused of bringing in cigarettes in exchange for at least $200 in cash bribes, the criminal division said. Both men have been suspended. The indictment charged Mr. Dowd with bribery, official misconduct, and engaging in a pattern of official misconduct. There is no record of a lawyer for Mr. Dowd, and Mr. Perricone's lawyer did not return a call for comment.
