A civil trial involving 2,140 families began with the High Court hearing details about how organs were removed from dead relatives, mostly children, over more than a decade without the consent of family members. They are seeking compensation from 130 hospitals around the country. An attorney for the families, Richard Lissak, told the court that the ''practice was objectionable on three levels -- morally, ethically and legally.'' In the cases presented yesterday, the bodies of two infants who died days after being born were returned to their parents after major organs, including their brains, had been removed. A lawyer for the National Health Service defended the medical professionals, saying, ''These are the self-same people who cared for these children'' and earned the gratitude of parents. ''Why should their devoted professionalism suddenly cease?''
