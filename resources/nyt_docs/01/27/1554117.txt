William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he wanted to forge closer ties with regulators from other countries to help fight corporate fraud. Speaking in Brussels ahead of meetings with Frits Bolkestein, the European commissioner for the internal market, Mr. Donaldson said the S.E.C. would build formal ties with the Committee of European Securities Regulators. He said that scandals like the one surrounding the Italian food company Parmalat "make us realize that fraud knows no borders."
