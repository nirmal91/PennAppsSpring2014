To the Editor:
Re ''Rivals Mine Kerry Senate Years for Material to Slow Him Down'' (front page, Jan. 25):
I am concerned about the concept of considering yesterday's positions in the face of today's information. There have been shifts in Senator John Kerry's positions -- and for that matter in the positions and opinions of most adults as the world evolves.
The way I see it, there are four main bases for self-contradiction:
*I didn't understand it then, but now I do.
*I was given misinformation then, but my current information has been validated.
*There is new information available that causes me to change my opinion.
*I must alter my opinion to appeal to special interest groups for political expediency.
Perhaps Mr. Kerry's shifts fall within all four categories. That would be consistent with politics in general.
