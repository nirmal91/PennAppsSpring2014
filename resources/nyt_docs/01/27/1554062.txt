An article on Saturday about Gen. Wesley K. Clark's difficulties in his first run for office quoted him as saying that a question about his Democratic credentials by the Fox News anchor Brit Hume at a debate on Thursday was ''part of a Republican Party agenda.'' The article also quoted a spokesman for General Clark as criticizing the network.
Because of an editing error, the article omitted a response by Fox News. Paul Schur, a spokesman for the network, dismissed the suggestion that Mr. Hume's question was prompted by anyone. ''General Clark should be used to facing tough questions about his record,'' Mr. Schur said. ''This isn't the first time questions have been raised about his affiliation. His handlers should spend their time on more constructive things such as trying to come up with reasons for the general's slippage in the polls.''
