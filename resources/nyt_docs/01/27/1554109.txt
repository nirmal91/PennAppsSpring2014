To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''The Widening of America, or How Size 4 Became a Size 0'' (Jan. 20): The article notes that children spend less time playing outdoors and more time in front of their televisions.
But you could dig further and point out that decreased physical activity, as recent research shows, is a result of suburban sprawl, which makes children more likely to sit around waiting for a ride to school, the mall or a friend's house.
We need to make transit funding a priority and design our cities in a way that gives kids the freedom to walk, bike and be healthy.
