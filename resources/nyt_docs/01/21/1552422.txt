The Guardian Council, which touched off a political crisis earlier this month by rejecting 3,600 candidates for Parliament, backed off a bit on Tuesday, reinstating 200 candidates and announcing that more reinstatements would follow, a member of the council said in a statement.
''So far, we have approved some 200 candidates who had been disqualified,'' read the statement, from Abbas Kadhodai. ''This trend will continue. After the order was given by the supreme leader, we have been obliged to speed up our work.''
With more than 60 reformist members of Parliament staging a sit-in, the country's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was forced to intervene last Wednesday. He ordered the reinstatement of all sitting members of Parliament and a re-evaluation of nonincumbents on their merits. The council had disqualified 83 current members.
The 12-member Guardian Council has the authority to evaluate both candidates for Parliament and laws emerging from the body, to assure that they are in keeping with Islamic law and the Constitution. It had rejected nearly half of the candidates -- a majority of them reformists -- who registered to run in the parliamentary elections on Feb. 20.
The council statement did not identify the 200 whose credentials were approved. The Guardian Council is expected to announce its final list around Feb. 10.
Despite the council's actions, members of Parliament continued their sit-in for a 10th day on Tuesday. Strikers said Tuesday that they would continue their protest until all the politically motivated disqualifications were reversed.
According to Iranian news reports, many reformist parliamentary candidates were rejected because they were neither sufficiently loyal to Ayatollah Khamenei, nor devoted enough to Islam.
A coalition of 18 reformist parties announced Sunday in an open letter to Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, that they would decide on Thursday whether to boycott the election.
