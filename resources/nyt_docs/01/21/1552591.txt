President Hugo Ch치vez has appointed his brother and confidant, Ad치n, to be ambassador to Cuba, a move sure to irritate the United States, which has raised concerns about Mr. Ch치vez's close ties to President Fidel Castro. Mr. Ch치vez's foes charge that his relationship with Mr. Castro is leading Venezuela down a radical political path. Venezuela has made the Castro government a close economic partner and is providing Cuba with oil at bargain-basement prices.
