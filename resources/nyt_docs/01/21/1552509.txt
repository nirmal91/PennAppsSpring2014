To the Editor:
Your Jan. 19 and 20 editorials describing Iowa as unrepresentative of the electorate at large and deriding the caucuses as clumsy miss the point. Voters in Iowa are better educated and more sophisticated about the political process than our ''hayseed'' image would suggest.
We may not be representative of any group but ourselves, but we know how to cut through the noise and focus on the candidates' positions on the issues.
As you saw on Monday night, neither superior fund-raising nor a superior organization guarantees success in Iowa. Here, it's the person and the message that count.
The caucuses are a lesson in civic responsibility. We Iowans take that seriously.
