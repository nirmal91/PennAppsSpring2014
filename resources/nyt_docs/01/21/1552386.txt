Donato Deserio, the chef and owner of Sette in Chelsea, dresses up ice cream, right, and biscotti, left, with gold leaf. He is just one of the chefs adorning confections with gold leaf, a luxurious decoration that home cooks can also use. Steve Martinez, who owns the Gold Leaf Company on Staten Island, charges $28 for 25 sheets of 23-karat gold leaf, each nearly four inches square, with a backing that peels off easily. He also sells gold bits and powder to sprinkle onto cakes or candies or into Champagne.
Gold of such purity, which is not toxic, has been used for centuries with food. It is widely sold in Europe, India, Japan, China and the United States. Information: www.goldleafcompany.com. Orders: (718) 815-8802.
