The Restaurants column last Wednesday, reviewing Bread Tribeca, at 301 Church Street in Manhattan, carried an erroneous star rating. The critic assigned it two stars, not one.
The review also misstated the reservation telephone number. It is (212) 334-8282; for delivery orders, (212) 334-0200.
The complete review is available online: nytimes.com/dining.
