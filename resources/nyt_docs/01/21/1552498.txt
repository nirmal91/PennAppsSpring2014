To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman thinks that the Bush administration's approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict is ''insane'' and that instead the administration should push for a solution similar to the Clinton plan (column, Jan. 18).
In manufacturing, where I work, we have a slogan: ''Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.''
The Clinton plan of negotiating for a two-state solution didn't work because the Palestinian leadership has not yet accepted a two-state solution. Yasir Arafat broke off negotiations at Camp David because he could not accept any solution that denied the right of return to all Palestinians.
It's insane to think that without a change in the Palestinian leadership, a repeat of the same negotiation strategy will produce a different result.
