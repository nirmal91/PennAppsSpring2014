The dispute over whether advertising for alcoholic beverages is being aimed at teenagers is taking a new twist, as an advocacy organization questions a campaign from Allied Domecq Spirits North America to promote its Malibu rum brand featuring the reggae singer Shaggy.
In letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the organization, the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, said that Shaggy should not have promoted Malibu because he had a large fan base among teenagers. The organization cited Shaggy's two Teen Choice awards, based on voting in Seventeen magazine and online, and performances with youthful musical acts like the Backstreet Boys, Bow Wow and Mandy Moore.
Chris Swonger, a spokesman at the North America operation of Allied Domecq in Westport, Conn., said that because Shaggy had a broad fan base, the company ''will carefully tailor the programming so it is directed to an adult audience.''
A spokesman at the F.T.C., Mitch Katz, said the agency would review and respond to the letter once it was received.
