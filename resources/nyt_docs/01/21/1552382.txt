Nuovo, a line of high-quality fresh pastas made in Stamford, Conn., includes ravioli, tortellini and agnolotti with appealing fillings like porcini; sun-dried tomato and Gorgonzola; and provolone and prosciutto. The company also makes gnocchi, penne and flat noodles, either plain or flavored with garlic, spinach, red pepper or basil.
Lightly glossed with warm olive oil or butter and a quick dusting of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, these pastas can make a first course at dinner, a lunch or a light supper. They come in 10-ounce plastic packages and last about a month refrigerated, longer in the freezer. Markets like Whole Foods and Fairway sell them for around $6.
