Lawrence M. Small, who heads the Smithsonian Institution, has entered into a plea agreement with a federal prosecutor in connection with charges that his private collection of Amazonian artifacts contained feathers of endangered bird species. Mr. Small will plead guilty to one count, a nonintentional misdemeanor violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The United States attorney will not recommend a fine or jail time, said a statement by the museum's board of regents. The statement also said that Mr. Small ''voluntarily surrendered his entire featherwork collection to the government.'' The United States Fish and Wildlife Service began an investigation after photographs of Mr. Small's collection were published in the Smithsonian magazine in January 2000.
