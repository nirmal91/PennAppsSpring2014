To the Editor:
Re ''Kerry Wins the Iowa Caucuses; Dean 3rd, Far Behind Edwards'' (front page, Jan. 20) and ''As Iowa Goes . . .'' (editorial, Jan. 19):
The Iowa caucuses are important not because they anoint the eventual nominee (they seldom do), and not because Iowans represent average American voters (who does?), but because they provide a wonderful lesson in democracy.
The heart of democracy is not pulling levers or punching out chads; it is government by discussion.
As we saw on TV news broadcasts on Monday night, Iowans came together to discuss candidates' positions and electability; they debated, they cajoled, they stood up on chairs, they shouted, they switched sides. In short, they performed politics.
And judging by the candidates who came out on top, caucusgoers registered their preferences without succumbing to an ''overpolled, overspun symphony of attack ads.''
Far from compromising the principle of ''one person, one vote,'' the caucuses demonstrate that citizenship is best enacted in conversation with other citizens.
