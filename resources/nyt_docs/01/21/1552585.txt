Two police officers were injured last night when bullets they fired to stop a charging pit bull hit each of them in the leg, a police spokesman said.The two officers and a lieutenant were answering a burglary call in Washington Heights at 11 p.m., the spokesman said. As they approached an apartment building at 1306 St. Nicholas Avenue, the pit bull charged at them. The officers fired six shots, hitting the dog. But some bullets appeared to have bounced off of the side entrance to the building. Each of the two officers was grazed by a bullet in the right leg, the spokesman said. The officers were taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital.
