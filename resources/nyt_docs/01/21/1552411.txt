To the Editor:
Re ''Meat Eater No More'' (letter, Jan. 16):
I am distraught when I read that people are not eating beef for various reasons. Most of these reasons are based on misinformation and propaganda.
I raise beef cattle in Texas. Like most ranchers, I do not feed my cows anything other than grass, hay and supplements like grain and corn. Feeding anything else is inhumane and economically unwise, as it may jeopardize the cows' health.
Rest assured, Mr. and Mrs. Public, we want and will continue to deliver the best-tasting, safest food product to your table and ours.
My family will continue to eat beef because we believe in our product.
