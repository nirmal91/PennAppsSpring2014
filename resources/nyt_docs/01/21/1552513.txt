To the Editor:
What a nuanced and sensitive reading of the Iowa Democrats in the midst of a blaming and accusing political landscape!
Iowa Democrats, David Brooks says (column, Jan. 20), are like the ''55-year-old teacher'' who ''loathes the No Child Left Behind Act.''
Non-Democrats are also left longing for political leadership that works toward a better life for all, including lifelong Republicans who no longer identify with the present administration. There are affluent and privileged Republicans who desire a more encompassing social and political vision rooted in the implicit and explicit ideals of our country's founding documents, and they do not hear a strong voice for their ideals from their political party of birth.
