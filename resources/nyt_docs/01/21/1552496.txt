To the Editor:
''War of Ideas, Part 4'' (column, Jan. 18), in which Thomas L. Friedman advocates that ''Israel must get out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as soon as possible and evacuate most of the settlements,'' was in my view right on the money. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has been festering for decades, is not the only reason for international terrorism, but it is an important one. Resolving the conflict fairly would benefit both Israelis and Palestinians and reduce the terrorist threat.
It is difficult to envisage a resolution without intelligent United States action along the lines Mr. Friedman suggests. Unfortunately, such action by the current administration is unlikely, especially in a presidential election year.
