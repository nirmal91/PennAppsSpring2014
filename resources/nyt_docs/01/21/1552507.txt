To the Editor:
Re ''Little Familiar With Setbacks, Dean Stumbles'' (front page, Jan. 20): Howard Dean energized the other Democratic presidential candidates; before he spoke so strongly about the disastrous, misleading policies of this administration, nobody expressed these views as clearly and as forcefully as he.
After Dr. Dean spoke out, every candidate spoke in those terms; whoever wins the Democratic nomination owes a debt to Howard Dean's courage and clarity.
