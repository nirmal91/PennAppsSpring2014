Matthew Higgins, who has often been the public face of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and even more often a behind-the-scenes influence, resigned yesterday to help the New York Jets' campaign for a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
His plan to join the Jets, effective Feb. 9, was announced at the corporation board meeting. ''Not as a player, I understand,'' said the chairman, John C. Whitehead.
Mr. Higgins, 29, will be the team's vice president for strategic planning, at a salary he would not disclose. Until Feb. 6, he is the chief operating officer and director of communications at the corporation, which pays him $160,000 a year.
He has worked for the corporation since February 2002. On Sept. 11, 2001, as press secretary to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, he was hastily calling off an impromptu press conference two blocks from the World Trade Center when the first tower collapsed.
The proposed stadium is officially known as the New York Sports and Convention Center, and it is to be an extension of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The stadium would be an Olympics site should New York be designated the host city. The Jets would play home games there.
