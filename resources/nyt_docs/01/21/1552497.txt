To the Editor:
Re ''War of Ideas, Part 4,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 18): I appreciate Mr. Friedman's asking me to withdraw from territories captured in a defensive war, settled now close to 40 years by three generations of Israelis, in order to ''have the moral high ground.'' Truly I do. But after witnessing what I'll get in return from my Palestinian neighbors following former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer of upward of 90 percent of the West Bank three years ago, I'll have to say, Thanks, but no thanks.
In a world filled with rising anti-Semitism, I think I'll pass on trying to achieve what the world considers ''moral.''
