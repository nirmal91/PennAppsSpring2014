To the Editor:
Re ''The Iowa Surprise'' (editorial, Jan. 20):
An Iowa Democratic caucus is primarily a social occasion, and a potentially awkward one at that. Many people are reluctant to align themselves publicly with a maverick candidate without knowing in advance how many others also intend to do so.
This major anomaly skews the results in favor of ''socially acceptable'' candidates and away from any candidate deemed ''controversial.''
John Kerry's ''surge,'' allegedly based on voters' belief in his superior electability, was most probably a retreat by self-conscious Iowa Democrats from Howard Dean, a candidate who had been increasingly lambasted for being ''too angry.''
This dynamic is nonexistent when the secret ballot is used, as in New Hampshire and beyond. Consequently, the results could easily be the reverse of those in Iowa in the ''real deal'' balloting to come.
