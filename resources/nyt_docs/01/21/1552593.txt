Hundreds of Italian and French cruise passengers were stranded in Barcelona after a Spanish court barred their ship from leaving port because of a contract dispute. The court ruled that the Italian-owned Festival cruise line owed more than $5 million to the company that leased the ship, European Stars. The 750 passengers found out that their 10-day Mediterranean tour would be cut short when the boat left dock but was prevented from leaving port by judicial order. Festival has promised to pay the cost of their trip home.
