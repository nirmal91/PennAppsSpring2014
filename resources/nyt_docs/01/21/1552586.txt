More than 300 Bronx day care employees represented by Day Care Workers Local 205 plan to rally today in front of City Hall to protest stalled contract negotiations. The workers are among 7,000 members of Local 205 who have been working without a contract for three years, and without a raise for four years, said Michael Green, a spokesman for District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Mr. Green, whose group includes Local 205 and five other locals, said the day care workers were pressing for pay raises comparable to those extended to other city workers in 2001 contracts.
