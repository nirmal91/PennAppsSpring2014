The conference of the International Association for Jazz Education, an annual convention of more than 7,000 jazz musicians, scholars, critics, broadcasters, and producers -- really, for anyone working with jazz around the world in any way -- begins today at two midtown Manhattan hotels, the Hilton New York and Towers and the Sheraton New York and Towers. Before it ends on Saturday, it will offer a blizzard of clinics and discussions on topics both minutely practical and philosophically wide. They range from ''How to Embellish Dominant-Seventh Chords and the Use of Tritone Subs'' (clinician: Jamey Aebersold, a pre-eminent publisher of jazz instruction books), to the much more contentious ''The Contributions and Influence of Latino Musicians in Jazz: A Supreme Historical Oversight'' (moderated by the percussionist Bobby Sanabria). In and around the panels and workshops will be dozens of performances, including those by Paquito D'Rivera and the New York Voices, the Dave Holland Quintet, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, Jason Moran's Bandwagon, Bob Brookmeyer and the New Art Orchestra, Nicholas Payton, David Sanchez, Michel Camilo, Jazz at Lincoln Center's Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, the English vocal-jazz newcomer Jamie Cullum, and the 14-year-old Italian saxophonist Francesco Cafiso. A National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Awards Concert, Friday at 8 p.m. in the Hilton Hotel's Grand Ballroom, will honor this year's winners of that award, with performers including Dave Brubeck, Clark Terry and the Heath Brothers. The jazz association had its first conference in 1968; only during the last decade has the membership enlarged beyond educators, and the annual conventions have become the supreme networking opportunity for the jazz world. Information on registration is available online at www.iaje.org.
