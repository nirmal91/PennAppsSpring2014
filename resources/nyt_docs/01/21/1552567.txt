Yahoo said yesterday that it would take its high-speed broadband service to Canada in a deal with Rogers Cable, the largest cable television system in the country. Starting sometime this year, customers of Rogers's high-speed Internet service will have the option of using e-mail, content and other services provided by Yahoo. Terms of the arrangement were not disclosed, but Yahoo said the deal resembled a venture with SBC Communications in the United States. SBC pays more than $1 a month per subscriber to Yahoo. The move is a response to Bell Canada's deal last year to offer similar services from Microsoft's MSN to its high-speed data customers, said Brahm Eiley, president of the Convergence Consulting Group, a market research firm in Toronto.
