Limestone Correctional Facility in Harvest will stop isolating H.I.V.-positive prisoners from the rest of the prison's population, allowing them to participate in educational and vocational programs with other prisoners. Alabama is the only state still to segregate H.I.V.-positive prisoners, said Margaret Winter, associate director of the A.C.L.U. National Prison Project. Ms. Winter called the new measures a ''huge and historic'' step. Women with H.I.V. are still segregated, she said.
