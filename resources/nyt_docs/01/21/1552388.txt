Waffles, roasted sweet potatoes, plain yogurt and vanilla ice cream can all gain new personality with a drizzle of hickory syrup, which is earthier and spicier than maple syrup. Hickoryworks in Trafalgar, Ind., makes this old-fashioned concoction, which is a sugar syrup infused with shagbark, from a kind of hickory. The owners, Gordon Jones and his wife, Sherrie Yarling, sell it at www.hickoryworks.com in plastic jugs starting at $16 a pint, including shipping. A fancy eight-ounce bottle with a wax seal, shown here, is $14.50 at the Web site and $15.50 at Dean &amp; DeLuca stores.
