The brewer Carlsberg has acquired a majority stake in a rival, Holsten, and will make a public offer for the remaining shares to take over the brewer, the second largest in Germany. Carlsberg said it had agreed with the largest shareholders to buy 51 percent at 38 euros a share, valuing Holsten at 1.065 billion euros or $1.3 billion, including debts and other liabilities, and will pay the same price for the remaining shares. The takeover must be approved by at least 24 percent of the remaining shareholders and would make Carlsberg the fifth-largest brewer in Germany. Holsten, based in Munich, makes Holsten pilsner and Feldschloesschen.

Correction:  January 26, 2004, Monday  A report in the World Business Briefing column on Wednesday about the acquisition of a majority stake in Germany's second-largest brewer, Holsten, by Carlsberg of Denmark referred incompletely to Carlsberg's plans. It intends to sell some of Holsten's operations, leaving it the fifth-largest brewer in Germany. Because of an editing error, the report also misstated the headquarters location of Holsten. It is Hamburg, not Munich.
