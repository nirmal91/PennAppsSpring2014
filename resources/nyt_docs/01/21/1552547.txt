Several witnesses have told detectives that they saw the writer and performer Spalding Gray aboard the Staten Island Ferry on the night his family believes he disappeared, a police official said yesterday.
Mr. Gray, who is 62 and has a history of depression, has been missing since Jan. 10, when he left his apartment in Manhattan after telling his family that he was going to see friends. He failed to board a flight at La Guardia Airport the next morning.
The police official said that the witnesses had recognized Mr. Gray, who performed Off Broadway as recently as last month and had appeared in a number of films, including ''Swimming to Cambodia'' (1987), based on a theatrical monologue that touched on his small role in the film ''The Killing Fields.''
The police official said that none of the witnesses had talked with Mr. Gray as the ferry crossed the harbor.
The police said last week that a mate on the ferry reported seeing Mr. Gray aboard a ferry on Jan. 9, the night before he vanished.
Sara Vass, a family friend, said the family had heard from a retired police detective who described seeing Mr. Gray at a diner in Orange County, N.Y., after he was reported missing.
''His description of Spalding was on the money,'' Ms. Vass said. ''The fellow he thought was Spalding came in and asked to sit at the window. The waitress said, 'That's a table for four people.' The man said, 'I want to sit by the window.' That is exactly what Spalding would do.''
Ms. Vass said Mr. Gray's family did not know what to make of the retired detective's report. ''It does give us some hope that he didn't go off the ferry,'' Ms. Vass said.
Mr. Gray's wife, Kathie Russo, called the police on Jan. 11 after discovering that he had not visited friends the previous evening or caught the flight that morning. The police said that when he was last seen, Mr. Gray was wearing a gray jacket with a blue scarf, a brown sweater, black corduroy pants and brown shoes.
