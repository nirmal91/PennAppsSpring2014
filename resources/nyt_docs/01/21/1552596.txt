Critics of the mayor of Washington filed paperwork with the city's Board of Elections and Ethics to seek his removal from office. The mayor, Anthony A. Williams, a Democrat, says he will fight the recall drive, which he contends will bring negative publicity to the city. Election law requires the organizers of the recall to collect more than 35,000 signatures in support of the effort. Mr. Williams was first elected in 1998; he said this month that he was considering a run for a third term in 2006.
