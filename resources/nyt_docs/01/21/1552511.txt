To the Editor:
As a Democrat with a family member active in one of the campaigns disappointed in Iowa, I went to bed bruised on Monday night. After reading David Brooks's column the next morning (''Keeping the Faith,'' Jan. 20), however, I am renewed.
Not because I accept that the primary process will forge a savior for me, but because a thoughtful, conservative Republican (Mr. Brooks) has acknowledged that there is something right and noble in the pursuit of ideals, in striving for change.
Mr. Brooks appears to understand that passionate participation in our most perfect system of debate, vote, dissent and renewal of debate is not treason but the lifeblood of democratic self-governance.
If the face of the current administration were more like Mr. Brooks's, dialogue would replace rancor and elevate us all.
