An 18-year-old cheerleader from Randolph who fell to her death from a balcony at a resort hotel on the island of Maui on Jan. 12 was intoxicated at the time, Hawaiian authorities said yesterday. The Maui County coroner, Dr. Anthony Manoukian, said tests had determined that the young woman, Lauren Crossan, left, had a blood-alcohol count of 0.17 percent, just over twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent for intoxication in Hawaii. The police have classified the death as an accident, but the investigation remains open. The head of the investigation, Lt. Tivoli Faaumu, said yesterday that detectives had not determined where Ms. Crossan had been drinking.
