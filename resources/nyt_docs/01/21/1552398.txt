To the Editor:
Though Nicholas D. Kristof's recognition of prostitution and sex trafficking as a modern form of slavery is welcome, his comment that American women's groups have done little to address this tragedy is misdirected (''Girls for Sale,'' column, Jan. 17).
Women's groups around the world have been fighting the commercial sex industry, a multibillion-dollar transnational enterprise, for decades.
Buying one or two girls out of sexual slavery is not a model of intervention. The prosecution of those creating and commercializing this demand, as well as the promotion of education and employment opportunities for girls otherwise left without alternative means of survival, would address the scourge of trafficking more effectively.
Governments turn a blind eye to the illegalities of commercial sexual exploitation and often play a more active role through the corrupt participation of government officials.
The inaction of governments, long decried by the women's movement, should be the target of Mr. Kristof's outrage.
