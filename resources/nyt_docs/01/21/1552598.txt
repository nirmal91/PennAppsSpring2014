Giants Coach Tom Coughlin came closer to rounding out his staff yesterday when he hired five assistant coaches.
Mike Waufle was named defensive line coach, after coaching Oakland's defensive line the past six seasons. Bill Davis will become linebackers coach after coaching Atlanta's linebackers for three years. Ron Milus will coach the defensive backs, having spent the 2003 season coaching Arizona's secondary. Mike Sullivan will become the wide receivers coach after spending this season as an offensive assistant with Jacksonville. Andy Barnett was hired as an assistant strength and conditioning coach after working for the IMG Academies.
Coughlin has not yet hired an offensive coordinator. He also will not hire the former Bears coach Dick Jauron, who talked to Coughlin about an assistant head coach position but took the job as Detroit's defensive coordinator instead.
