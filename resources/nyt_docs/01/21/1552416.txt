American military officials said Tuesday that a raid over the weekend in southern Afghanistan had killed only 5 Taliban militants, not 11 civilians, as Afghan officials have reported.
But Abdul Rahman, the chief of the Char Chino district in Oruzgan Province, where the incident took place, said again on Tuesday that 11 civilians had been killed, including three women and four children.
''I collected the bodies with people and I also participated in their funeral ceremony,'' he said by telephone. ''If the Americans think those four men who were our friends, those four children and three women were the Taliban, that is something not acceptable.''
But Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, a spokesman for the American-led coalition, said at a news conference on Tuesday that coalition forces had engaged ''five armed adult males fleeing from a known terrorist compound'' after receiving intelligence on Saturday evening about a gathering of midlevel Taliban fighters.
''The commander on the ground verified that these individuals were indeed armed and, at night, moving toward a known coalition military unit,'' he said.
''There is no indication that any civilians were involved,'' he said.
