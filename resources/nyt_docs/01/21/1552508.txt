To the Editor:
Once again, you look down your nose at the Iowa caucuses as ''less than democratic'' (''The Iowa Surprise,'' editorial, Jan. 20).
Never mind that attendance at the caucuses was open to any registered voter and that each caucus vote carried equal weight.
No one out here claims that Iowa is as diverse as New York or that Iowa is in any way representative of the country as a whole. Neither is New York, of course, though you seem to think otherwise.
What the Iowa caucuses provided was a unique (and uniquely democratic) first test of the candidates' fitness to go on. No more, no less.
