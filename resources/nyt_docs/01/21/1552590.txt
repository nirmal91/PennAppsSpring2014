A leader of an 800-member right-wing paramilitary unit that disbanded in November spoke before Congress, urging lawmakers to approve a deal to allow the rest of the 15,000-member militia army to demobilize in exchange for house arrest and the payment of reparations. The appearance in Congress was a first for a leader of the paramilitary force, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, which has committed widespread rights violations in the 40-year conflict. Wearing a suit and tie, the commander, Giovanny Mar√≠n, said ''ours is an honest gesture'' aimed at ensuring peace. Critics say a deal would allow warlords to walk free.
