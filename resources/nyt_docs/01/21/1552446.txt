'Three Sisters'  manhattantheatresource
A timeless play in an absorbing production awaits visitors to 177 Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village, where Anton Chekhov's ''Three Sisters'' is playing through Jan. 31.
Designated a drama by Chekhov, it has -- like life itself -- elements of comedy and tragedy as it sweeps in its understated way across a panorama of yearning, frustrated dreams and ambition; love found, lost, unrequited, betrayed and ill-chosen; selfishness and cruelty; disappointment and disillusion; and ultimately the very meaning of individual human existence.
Presented here in a new translation by Boris Kievsky, ''Three Sisters'' remains the story of the Prozorov sisters -- Olga (Hope Garland) the schoolteacher, the nubile Irina (Carla Tassara) and the moody Masha (Catherine Zambri) -- and their eventual dispossession by the crude and faithless wife of their brother (Fiona Jones and Mr. Kievsky) from the home in a provincial town where they were brought years before by their father, a general, now dead.
Here, too, are their circle: Vershinin (Ato Essandoh), the new battery commander who will enrapture Masha and cuckold her stubbornly loving schoolteacher husband, Kuligin (Jason Howard); Baron Tuzenbach (Mitchell Riggs), the young officer who will sacrifice all for the unreciprocated love of Irina; the destructive officer Solyony (Daryl Boling); and the old, defeated family friend, the military doctor Chebutikin (Neil Maffin).
Jewel that it is, ''Three Sisters'' presents many facets, and from production to production one might gleam more brightly than another.
In this one, directed by Andrew Frank and solidly performed by an appealing cast, deep resonance emanates from the philosophical musings led by Vershinin that link ''Three Sisters'' not only to the impending upheaval in Russia but also to all who ponder life and their own impact on generations to follow.
