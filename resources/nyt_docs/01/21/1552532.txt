A review yesterday about a concert peformance of Britten's opera ''Peter Grimes'' by the London Symphony Orchestra credited the tenor in the title role, Glenn Winslade, incorrectly with another performance last summer. It was Christopher Ventris who sang the title role in ''Parsifal'' at the Seattle Opera.
