President Vladimir V. Putin used a visit on Tuesday by the head of the World Bank to underscore his plans for economic improvements at home, as well as Russia's intention to forgive more debts owed by poor nations.
At a meeting here with the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, Mr. Putin said Russia wanted to use its higher profile as a World Bank member to illustrate how its economic and financial situation had improved. The bank has given Russia about $8.4 billion in loans since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Russia will hold the presidency of the Group of 8 industrialized nations in 2006, and political analysts suggested that Mr. Putin wanted to illustrate that Russia had reached a level of prosperity strong enough to further distance itself from fiscally strapped countries.
''For Putin, it's important that Russia stands up from its knees and becomes a full-fledged World Bank member, not as supplicants but as members of the global finance community,'' said Dmitri V. Trenin, director of research of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ''And in terms of debt relief, Putin wants to rebuild Russia as an economic power. He understands that the basis of greatness in this day and age is economic.''
In remarks broadcast on national television, Mr. Putin said he would focus on ''significant acceleration of economic growth'' and ''resistance to poverty.'' He also pledged that Russia would ''continue improving its economic institutions, budget policy, financial markets and banking sector,'' as well as promoting small and medium-size businesses.
Mr. Putin also said that Russia would intensify debt forgiveness to third world countries, but he did not say which ones. The Kremlin responded to calls by the United States to forgive Iraq's debt, wiping out more than half the $8 billion Soviet-era debt Iraq still owed to Russia in the hope that it would help Russian oil companies to do business there.
