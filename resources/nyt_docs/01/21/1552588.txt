Officials denied in court for a third time that they were holding a Pakistani journalist who worked with two French journalists who were arrested last month for traveling to Quetta without government permission and later released. An international press advocacy group called the government statement a ''state lie'' and said the journalist, Khawar Mehdi Rizvi, had been held by Pakistani intelligence officials for 35 days. Government officials have said privately that the journalist is in government custody.
