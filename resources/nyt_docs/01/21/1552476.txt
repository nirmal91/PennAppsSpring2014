Accounting rules in Europe must be overhauled in the wake of the Parmalat scandal, the European commissioner for the internal market, Frits Bolkestein, told finance ministers from the 15 countries in the union Tuesday.
The collapse of one of Europe's biggest food companies may be even greater than the collapse of Enron, Mr. Bolkestein said. The Enron scandal prompted a revision in the way auditing should be regulated in the European Union, but the changes expected to be announced in March are being reviewed in light of Parmalat's problems, he said, adding that member countries should put the reforms in place without delay.
The commission will propose requiring one audit firm to take over all responsibility for large companies when there is more than one auditor to handle different divisions.
The proposal will also try to prevent auditors from getting involved in management decisions for clients; to strengthen oversight of auditing firms with a system of national regulators in the 15 member countries; and to reinforce coordination with regulators in countries outside the European Union.
