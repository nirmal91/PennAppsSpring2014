A prominent lawyer in Brooklyn was arraigned yesterday on federal charges that he took $11,000 in bribes to fix prices on buildings for which he was the court-appointed auctioneer.
The lawyer, Edward S. Reich, who has been a vice president of the New York State Bar Association, faces up to eight years in prison if convicted, according to federal sentencing guidelines.
He pleaded not guilty before Joan M. Azrack, a federal magistrate in Brooklyn.
Mr. Reich, 67, has frequently been appointed by state judges in Brooklyn to be the referee in the sale of foreclosed property, a job that usually pays $500. The referee is supposed to sell the property to the highest bidder, use the proceeds to pay off the mortgage and other liens and give any money left over to the original property owner.
But according to an affidavit filed in December by an F.B.I. agent, in 2002 and 2003 Mr. Reich accepted bribes from a real estate investor, Jonathan Einhorn, and in return, lowered the sale prices on two Brooklyn properties by $20,000 and $45,000, respectively. Mr. Einhorn has also been charged in the alleged scheme.
In June 2002, according to the affidavit, Mr. Reich was the referee in the sale at Supreme Court in Brooklyn of a house on Rutland Road in East Flatbush. Mr. Einhorn won the house with a bid of $283,000.
After the bidding closed, the affidavit states, Mr. Einhorn met with Mr. Reich in an office behind the court clerk's office and later told a government informant that in the meeting, Mr. Reich accepted $2,000 in cash to change the price to $263,000.
In June 2003, the affidavit says, Mr. Reich knocked $45,000 off the auction price of a house on Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant in return for $2,000 in cash.
Neither Mr. Reich nor his lawyer, Robert Katzberg, responded to messages left at their offices last night. The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, which is prosecuting the case, declined to provide details about the case yesterday.
