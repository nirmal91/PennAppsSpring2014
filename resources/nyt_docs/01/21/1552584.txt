Three volunteer firefighters kicked and punched a fellow firefighter outside the Classics Sports Bar in Levittown early Monday morning, the Nassau County police said yesterday. The three firefighters, Daniel Lennon, 29, Anthony Parsell, 21, and Joseph Contino, 28, all of Levittown, each charged with second-degree gang assault, were arraigned yesterday in First District Court in Hempstead. The police said that Mr. Lennon attacked Scott Jenkins outside the bar at 1:16 a.m. Monday while the two others kicked him and prevented others from stopping the fight. The police said that the three had been drinking and that there was a longstanding enmity between Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Lennon.
