To the Editor:
Re ''Improving the People at the Head of the Class'' (Education page, Jan. 14):
As a 43-year-old teacher of adults who has just become certified to teach K-8, I see many reasons ''half of all teachers leave the classroom within the first five years.'' But money is what keeps a large percentage of the best and brightest from even considering this profession.
My hometown, Edison, N.J., has 300 substitutes on a waiting list and is a top choice for employment by teachers. Why? Because it has one of the most competitive pay scales in the state.
Money isn't everything, but it does expand one's options.
