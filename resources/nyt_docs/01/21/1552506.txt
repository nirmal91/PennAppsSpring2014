To the Editor:
Howard Dean's showing in Iowa is no reason for his campaign to view the results as a ''setback'' (''Little Familiar With Setbacks, Dean Stumbles,'' front page, Jan. 20).
True to his profession as a physician, Dr. Dean has provided an invaluable service to the Democratic Party: he has correctly diagnosed the party's drift into Bush-lite, offered a compelling prescription to energize the disaffected, and has given the other presidential candidates a much-needed injection of spine.
The policy emphases of his campaign from the very start are emerging as the critical themes of all the leading Democratic candidates.
Democrats continue to need the doctor in this race to keep the party focused on offering a clear alternative to the Republican Party, instead of a mere shadow of it.
