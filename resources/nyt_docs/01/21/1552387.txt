Lovely silvery smelts from cold northern lakes and estuaries glitter on ice in markets now. The slender fish, often no more than six inches long, have sweet, rich flesh, with enough fat to insulate them in wintry weather. When fresh, they have an aroma that suggests cucumbers. Buy them whole and have them gutted. Small ones do not need filleting because their bones are soft and edible.
For me, there is no finer weekend breakfast than softly scrambled eggs with smelts fried in clarified butter. First, I give them a slick of milk and then a light coating of white cornmeal seasoned with salt and cayenne.
They are about $5 a pound at Citarella, above, and $3.99 a pound at Fairway markets.
