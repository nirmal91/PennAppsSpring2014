A court ordered the city of Moscow to pay compensation to families of victims of the theater siege by Chechen guerrillas in 2002, when at least 129 hostages died, most from a gas used when commandos stormed the building. The court ordered both lump-sum and monthly payments to relatives of four victims of the three-day siege.
