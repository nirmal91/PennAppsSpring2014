The chief executive of the Lonza Group, a biotechnology and chemicals company, resigned as the company posted a decline of 59 percent in 2003 profit. The chief executive, Markus Gemuend, left, who joined Lonza's legal department in 1988, stepped down after less than two years in the job, the company said. Lonza, based in Basel, said that it had expected a recovery in the second half of 2003, but that its net income fell to 91 million Swiss francs ($71.6 million) from 221 million francs. The company said its largest unit, Exclusive Synthesis and Biotechnology, had been hurt by a low rate of drug approvals, inventory reduction by customers, and overcapacity in the industry.
