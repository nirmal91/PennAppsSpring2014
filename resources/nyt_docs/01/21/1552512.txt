To the Editor:
Re ''Keeping the Faith,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 20):
Like the quintessential Democrat in Mr. Brooks's column, I consider myself moderate and progressive. I am also optimistic that this country can still be turned around, from one that is beholden to corporate interests back to one that truly represents ''we the people.''
Speaking of Iowa, Mr. Brooks notes that he was ''struck by how oblivious this campaign has been to the consequences of 9/11.''
In fact, all Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, are fully aware of what happened on that day. The difference between the current administration (which is by no means representative of all Republicans) and every single Democratic candidate is that the Democrats refuse to use a national tragedy and fearmongering to further a political agenda.
