In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court has sentenced a former army colonel, Juan Valencia Osorio, to 30 years in prison for ordering the 1990 murder of Myrna Mack, an anthropologist who was researching military rights abuses committed against the country's Maya Indians. Colonel Valencia, a former head of the presidential security unit, was found guilty in 2002, the first time a military officer had been convicted of a war crime during the country's long civil war, but was released on appeal until Ms. Mack's family won a ruling overturning that decision.
