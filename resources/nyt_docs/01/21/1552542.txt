A concourse at Bradley International Airport was evacuated Tuesday for more than an hour after a utility knife that had been slipped through a security checkpoint was found in a bathroom trash can.
Nine flights were delayed from 10 minutes to an hour after a maintenance worker found the knife around 2:30 p.m., said Mike Ross, operations specialist for the airport.
A Delta Song flight departing for Orlando, Fla., was called back to the gate to be swept for security; its passengers were required to pass through security once more before reboarding, said Dan Lee, manager of the Transportation Security Administration, an agency of the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Mr. Lee said he did not know how the knife had made it past security.
''I can't speculate how it got there,'' he said. Mr. Lee described the knife as ''the kind you can buy for 29 cents at the hardware store. The adjustable blade was housed in a plastic case.''
About one-third of the airport was involved in the evacuation.
People in the boarding area, beyond the security checkpoint, were moved back to the main terminal area and ticket counter, Mr. Ross said.
Officers and police dogs with the Connecticut State Police searched the concourse before people were rescreened at the security checkpoint, said Sgt. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the state police. By 3:40 p.m. the entire concourse was back in operation, Mr. Lee said.
When Dennis Forgy arrived at 3:30 p.m. for an evening flight to Florida, he saw a long line snaking past the ticket counter. His first impression did not involve security concerns.
''I thought: 'What? Did the Beatles get back together again?''' he said, adding that the line dispersed quickly.
