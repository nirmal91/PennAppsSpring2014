As their colleagues watched the president's State of the Union address from the House chamber, four lawmakers and the secretary of commerce, Donald L. Evans, listened on Tuesday night from an undisclosed spot.
During presidential speeches to Congress attended by the cabinet, it is customary for one cabinet member to stay away in case of attack or disaster.
This year, four members of Congress joined Mr. Evans: Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the former Republican leader; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate; Representative Christopher Cox of California, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee; and Representative George Miller of California, chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee.
Although Mr. Evans, one of the president's fellow Texans, was tapped to stay behind this year, he has often been at the forefront of Mr. Bush's political appointees, having raised $90 million in donations for Mr. Bush's first presidential campaign.
Mr. Reid said, ''I'm sorry I'll miss the speech, but I was asked to take on this responsibility for the country and I'm happy to do it.''
The practice, which began during the cold war, has taken on a larger meaning since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, on New York and the Pentagon.
Vice President Dick Cheney also spends a great deal of time working away from the president to ensure the continuity of government.
But Mr. Cheney watched the speech on Tuesday night from his usual position behind the president and next to J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker.
