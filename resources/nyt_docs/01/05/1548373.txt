Three children and three adults were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes that leaked from a faulty boiler in the basement of their Brooklyn apartment building yesterday, the authorities said.
The problem became apparent about 11 a.m., when the three children could not be awakened after a full night's sleep, said their mother, Pamela Williams, 36. Ms. Williams said she was at work when she received a call about the sleeping children from her companion, Raheem Carthens, 26, who was at home at the family's third-floor apartment at 774 Nostrand Avenue, in Crown Heights.
Ms. Williams raced home from work to see what was wrong. She called 911, and when paramedics arrived, they tested the air and told her there was carbon monoxide present and everyone would have to be evacuated, she said.
The children, Teneequa Morris, 8, Princess White, 11, and Waymon Morris, 14, were given oxygen and taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where they were recovering last night. In addition to Ms. Williams, Mr. Carthens and the three children, a woman who lives on the second floor was briefly hospitalized, Ms. Williams said.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be released as a heating byproduct. In this case, it was released when the boiler malfunctioned after getting blocked up with excess carbon, said Shawn Rosvold, a spokesman for KeySpan. ''It usually boils down to bad maintenance,'' he said.
Calls to the building's landlord were not returned yesterday. The building, which has a furniture store on the ground floor, does not have a superintendent, Ms. Williams said.
Ms. Williams said she and her entire family had felt ill and passed out on Dec. 27, the last day prior to yesterday that they were all in the apartment. One of her daughters had also lost consciousness two days earlier, but when she was taken to a hospital, the doctors found nothing wrong, Ms. Williams said.
''We thought it was a bug that was going around,'' she said.
