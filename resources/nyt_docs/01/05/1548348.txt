To the Editor:
Re ''A Wounded United Nations'' (editorial, Jan. 2):
You are certainly correct that we need the United Nations to be an effective partner. But the United Nations cannot be useful in a world where the harsh realities are measured in coffins, unless and until it grows a spine and demonstrates that it can be an effective partner when the going gets a little bit tougher than a harshly worded memo.
