A 45-year-old Brooklyn man was found dead of a stab wound to his neck yesterday inside the elevator of a Bushwick apartment building, the police said.
The victim, identified last night as Jose Perez, lived in the building at 878 Park Avenue, the authorities said. His body was discovered at about 5:30 p.m. after the police received several calls from people who said there was an unconscious man in the elevator cab, which was off the building's lobby.
The circumstances remained unclear early today, and the police said the office of the city medical examiner would determine the cause of death.
