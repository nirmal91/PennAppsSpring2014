As a book review, it was neither fish nor fowl.
The Wall Street Journal published a review in its Personal Journal section's Leisure &amp; Arts department last week, under the heading Bookshelf -- a rubric generally reserved for reviews. But it was not really a review; more of a summary, actually.
Taxonomy becomes crucial here, because the writer of the piece, about a bound collection of animal articles first printed in The Journal, was Ken Wells, who was also the editor of the book.
The book, ''Herd on the Street'' (Wall Street Journal, 2003) is a compilation of some of the paper's best Page 1 feature articles on animals. Over the years, packs of elephants and mice, frogs and dogs have roamed across The Journal's front page -- in a slot that each weekday offers a bit of respite from the serious financial reporting elsewhere on the page.
Last Tuesday, in the article about the book, Mr. Wells wrote that animals ''make great stories because they become metaphors for the great issues that roll through society.''
Is it also a great story when a Wall Street Journal senior writer edits a book of Wall Street Journal animal articles and then writes about it for The Wall Street Journal's cultural pages?
Not according to Brigitte Trafford, a spokeswoman for The Journal.
''Our policy is not to run standard book reviews of staff-written books,'' Ms. Trafford said. ''We either run excerpts, or a summary, if we do anything, and in this case we let Ken Wells describe the book himself, all fully disclosed to the reader.''
In chronicling critter lore at the paper, Mr. Wells mentioned stalking a hippo, observing goldfish surgery and discovering a German government requirement that farmers spend ''quality time'' with their pigs.
''Everything Ken describes actually happened,'' Ms. Trafford said.
