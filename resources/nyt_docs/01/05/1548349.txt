To the Editor:
Re ''A Wounded United Nations'' (editorial, Jan. 2):
Indeed, there are good reasons for the United States to expand the United Nations' role in Iraq -- international legitimacy and burden-sharing being the most prominent rationales. But the Bush administration's reluctance to turn to the United Nations is a logical response to the failures of United Nations peacekeeping and nation-building in the 1990's.
The United Nations failed to act in Kosovo, at first proved inept in Sierra Leone and rushed to elections in the institutionally weak states of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia.
In short, even if the Bush administration's approach to the United Nations is wrong, recent history shows it to be reasonable.
