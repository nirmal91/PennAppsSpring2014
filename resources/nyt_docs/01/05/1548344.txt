To the Editor:
Bravo for your insightful editorial series ''Harvesting Poverty.'' You make clear the economic and moral case for the elimination of farm subsidies that unfairly handicap poor countries' exports.
The muscle of the farm lobbies in the United States and other rich countries is an interesting reflection of how democracies often give more weight to rural voters -- a dynamic begun with our constitutional system over two centuries ago. This suggests that out-of-control agricultural subsidies may be just one symptom of seriously unbalanced political systems in many countries, including our own.
