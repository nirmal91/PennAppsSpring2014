A military analysis article on Thursday about the issue of persuading nations to abandon unconventional weapons programs, after Libya's decision to do so, misstated the timing of South Africa's decision to give up nuclear weapons. It was made by F. W. de Klerk, president under the last apartheid government, who issued an internal order to dismantle the nuclear arsenal in 1990 and disclosed that decision to Parliament in 1993. The successor government, under black majority rule, reconfirmed South Africa's nonnuclear status.
