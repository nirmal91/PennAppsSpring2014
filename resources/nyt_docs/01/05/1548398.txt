JANUARY is a month of pilgrimages for many who love cars.
The public and the press will preview automakers' new and not-yet models at international shows in Detroit and Los Angeles. Meanwhile, collectors and a small army of celebrity car enthusiasts will book flights to Arizona for bellwether events like the annual Barrett-Jackson Classic Car Auction in Scottsdale, where bidding for rare and finely restored cars will establish a market barometer for the coming season.
Vintage-car experts are not expecting anything like the wild boom that shook the collector market 15 years ago, when investors poured money into four-wheel financial instruments as the American dollar and stock market weakened while European currencies strengthened.
As a result, between 1984 and 1989 the values of some cars skyrocketed. For example, 1972-73 Ferrari Daytona Spiders costing $100,000 when the boom began sold for $1.2 million five years later. But that market collapsed in 1991 -- Daytona Spiders have since been in the $350,000 range -- and a more rational mindset has prevailed. Likewise, Lamborghini 350 GT's from 1964-66, of which only 143 were built, once brought more than $200,000. A professionally restored example, accompanied by $24,000 in receipts for recent work, brought just $81,400 at auction last year.
Today's market is less volatile, though some sectors have advanced sharply. Values for American-built coupes from the mid-1950's through the mid-1970's have shown a sizeable increase; well-restored two-door '57 Chevrolets bring over $30,000.
Traditionally, only convertibles from this era were highly valued, and while still costly, their prices have drifted lower. Fully optioned 1957 Chevrolet convertibles restored to showroom condition that sold for more than $100,000 two years ago can be bought today for $75,000 to $80,000.
Record-shattering prices for Corvettes were seen at a Mecum Collector Car auction held in St. Charles, Ill. last October. A 1955 'Vette documented as a factory prototype for the installation of V-8 engines introduced that year brought $262,500. More surprising: a 1969 Corvette, equipped with the 430-horsepower L88 engine option and only 2,535 miles on the odometer, brought $168,000.
''This price is simply the result of more guys reaching an age where they've got money to spend,'' said Dana Mecum, owner of the auction company. ''They're going to spend it buying the best and rarest, the cars they dreamed about when they were 16.''
Even commonplace Corvettes of the 1968-82 generation -- known as the C3 models to collectors -- are enjoying increased valuations. In 2002, models from the mid-1970's with the anemic 350 cubic-inch engines of the era could barely get past $8,000. Now, in nice condition, they bring as much as $15,000.
Classic American hot rods built in the 40's and 50's continue to attract interest if they have period-correct engines and chassis (as opposed to those built from kits available today) and historical significance. A '32 Ford hot rod used by Ricky Nelson in the television series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' sold for $192,000 in August.
Collectors continue to pay top dollar for rare models that have exceptional histories. A 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B with a well-documented racing history recently sold for $10 million in a private transaction, according to one Alfa specialist. Impressive as it may sound, it falls short of the record $15 million that a group of Japanese businessmen reportedly paid in 1990 for a Bugatti Royale coupe with coachwork by Kellner.
Prices of project cars -- those that need substantial work or complete restoration -- continue to decline, a result of the ever-increasing costs of restoration. Labor rates now exceed $100 an hour at some shops and environmental regulations have driven up the cost of painting and chrome-plating.
But some American classics bring strong prices even when key components are not the same as those installed at the factory. A 1935 Duesenberg Model J convertible sold at auction for $825,000 in the past year, despite not having its original engine.
Savvy enthusiasts often seek out cars that have been lovingly restored by a hobbyist as a labor of love, rather than for financial gain. The seller's financial loss -- the cost of pursuing an expensive hobby -- can be a substantial gain for the buyer. For example, a 1968 Pontiac GTO convertible sold for $61,101 at a sale held by RM Auctions last August in Monterey, Calif. Accompanying the car was a scrapbook full of restoration receipts totaling more than $120,000.
Predicting the future, or at least the next 12 months, is easy when it comes to the collector car market. Properly restored examples of popular models will continue to go up in price. Unpopular models, project cars and sloppily restored cars will go down. You don't have to be a genius to decide which camp is the better one to be in.
