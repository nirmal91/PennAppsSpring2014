To the Editor:
The United Nations' wounds (editorial, Jan. 2) were self-inflicted. It allowed Saddam Hussein to flout 12 years of Security Council resolutions. Its ill-judged security arrangements in Baghdad made the horrific bombing possible. Its excuses for not participating in Iraq's reconstruction are shown to be hollow by the successful rebuilding being accomplished by the coalition's military and by private companies like Bechtel and Halliburton.
The world needs an effective United Nations. The solution must be for the United Nations to reform itself, not for the United States to change its policy.
