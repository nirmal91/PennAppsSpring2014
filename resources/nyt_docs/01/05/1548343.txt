To the Editor:
Re ''India's Soybean Farmers Join the Global Village'' (front page, Jan. 1):
Knee-jerk adherents to the anti-globalism campaign would be well advised to note the benefits that farmers worldwide reap from connection to international markets.
Far from being crushed by a corporate overlord, Ravi Sham Choudhry and his fellow farmers seem to be well served by their relationship with ITC Ltd., which provides computers and Internet access to rural villages in India so farmers can check global and local prices.
Mr. Choudhry's example is a refreshing counterpoint to images of manufacturers taking advantage of low labor costs in third world countries to exploit free-trade regulations. Used wisely and properly, global markets bring the greatest benefit to those with the greatest need: individual farmers who can take greater control over the sale of their own goods.
