To the Editor:
The conclusion that the richest Americans ''give their share and even more'' (Business Day, Jan. 1) is flawed by its reliance on tax returns.
The vast majority of charity in America is never deducted from taxes, whether it takes the form of a donation during a church service, a gift to a needy person or volunteering of one's time. And giving by the super-rich is likely to decline with the Bush administration's elimination of the estate tax, which provided one of the biggest incentives for charitable donations.
Instead of celebrating the money given by people who have excessive amounts of it, we should question the economic system that subsidizes the wealthy while allowing so much poverty to persist.
