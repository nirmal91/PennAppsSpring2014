Gen. Wesley K. Clark said on Sunday that he would not accept the vice-presidential spot on a Democratic ticket, putting an end perhaps to a question that has dogged his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.
''I've said I am not going to be the vice president, and that's what I stand by,'' General Clark said in an interview on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''I am not going to accept that nomination. I can't make it any clearer than that.''
The question has hovered over the Clark campaign since last summer, when Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, met with General Clark, who at the time was trying to decide whether to enter the race.
General Clark has said that in that meeting Dr. Dean dangled the possibility of a Dean-Clark ticket. Dr. Dean has said he made no such offer.
General Clark, who has no previous political experience, has said repeatedly that he is running for president and not for the No. 2 spot. But until Sunday he had not explicitly ruled out the possibility of accepting such an offer.
Last week, he dismissed the possibility of joining a Dean ticket.
Pressed on the question on Sunday by Tim Russert, the host of ''Meet the Press,'' General Clark replied: ''I am running to be president of the United States. I am not running to be vice president. And I do not intend to accept that nomination, and I will not.''
''Absolutely?'' Mr. Russert asked.
General Clark replied, ''That's absolutely the facts.''
