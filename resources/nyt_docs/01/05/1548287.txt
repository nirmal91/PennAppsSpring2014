To the Editor:
Re ''Who's Nader Now?,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 2):
Before a single vote has been cast in Iowa, New Hampshire or anywhere else, Mr. Krugman scolds various Democratic presidential contenders and compares them to Ralph Nader, the 2000 general election spoiler, because they've had the audacity to attack and erode support for Howard Dean, the presumptive primary front-runner.
Only when Dr. Dean actually locks up enough convention delegates to secure his party's nomination should rival Democrats feel obliged to fall in line behind him.
Until then, Dr. Dean is just one of nine candidates vying against one another in the rough-and-tumble world of primary politics, and Democrats who believe that he would be trounced by President Bush and make Democratic candidates for other offices less attractive to mainstream American voters are free to say so, again and again, at the top of their lungs.
