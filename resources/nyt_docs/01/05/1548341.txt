A picture by The Associated Press in Arts &amp; Ideas on Saturday with an article about the involvement of Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad, the chief of staff to the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, in the business affairs of the pop star Michael Jackson was mislabeled by the news agency and published in error. (It also appeared in the News Summary.) It showed Ishmael Muhammad, a minister of the Nation of Islam and son of its former leader, Elijah Muhammad.
