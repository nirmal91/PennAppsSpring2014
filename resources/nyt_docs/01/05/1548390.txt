The picture caption on Saturday with a profile of Theodor Meron, president of the war crimes tribunal dealing with atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, misstated a word in his quotation. It should have read, as it appeared in the article itself, ''We must remember, without this tribunal, what would have followed is impunity''; he did not say ''trial.''
