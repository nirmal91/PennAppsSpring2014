A headline on Dec. 7 about the Bush administration's $2 billion increase in foreign development aid referred incorrectly in some copies to the intended use. Half of the increase is to fight poverty around the world; $600 million is to help fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. The increase is not ''mostly'' to fight AIDS in Africa.
