To the Editor:
Re ''A Wounded United Nations'' (editorial, Jan. 2):
After outlining how the United States has undermined and emasculated the United Nations, you recommend that the United Nations take an active part in Iraq's recovery, notwithstanding the continued contempt shown to it by the Bush administration and in the face of unclear United States intentions regarding the formation of a putatively independent Iraqi government.
You would better serve the cause of international law by supporting Secretary General Kofi Annan's caution about involving the United Nations in Iraq's recovery.
That caution is warranted given the administration's demonstrated intention of using others, whether allies or the United Nations, to give a patina of multilateralism and legality to an adventure that is clearly unilateral and destabilizing.
