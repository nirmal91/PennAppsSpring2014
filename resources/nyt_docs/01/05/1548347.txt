To the Editor:
Re ''A Wounded United Nations'' (editorial, Jan. 2):
The Bush administration legitimizes and delegitimizes the United Nations for its own political convenience. The United States defied the United Nations and attacked Iraq unilaterally. What was one of our main reasons for attacking Iraq? That Saddam Hussein defied the United Nations.
