With all the attention paid to China's success in selling its products on the world market, it is easy to forget that the Chinese can be avid consumers themselves. China's appetite for electronics is likely to be one of the most important contributors to growth in the semiconductor business this year, according to IDC, a market research firm.
Global demand for semiconductors picked up in the second half of 2003, leading IDC to raise its forecast for 2004. It now expects industry revenue to grow a healthy 18 percent, to $189 billion, the largest increase since 2000. More than half of the chips produced will be for PC's and cellphones, and China is now a leading market for both of those products, IDC said.
China's own chip industry is booming as a result of demand from foreign and local buyers for low-cost production. As Chinese companies evolve over the next few years and work on producing more sophisticated chips, they ''will play a key role in shaking up the competitive ranks'' of the global industry, said Mario Morales, vice president for semiconductor research at IDC.
