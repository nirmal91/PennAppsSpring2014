To the Editor:
Re ''2 More Flights Are Called Off After Warnings'' (front page, Jan. 2): I noticed while traveling through O'Hare Airport in Chicago that there were separate lines for screening the first-class passengers. Since greater resources were being devoted to the first-class passengers, I can only assume that this practice is used to minimize their waiting period and inconvenience.
This does not strike me as a valid goal for a government agency. It would seem to accomplish the opposite of the purpose of the Transportation Security Administration, which is to maximize security while minimizing the wait and inconvenience for all passengers. Why has the agency adopted this policy?
