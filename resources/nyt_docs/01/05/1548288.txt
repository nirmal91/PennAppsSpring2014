To the Editor:
Re ''Study Clears Way for 900 New Cabs: Fares May Increase'' (front page, Jan. 1):
Sounds good to me, but please, no new cabs with that axle running down the middle of the back seat, making New York taxis the world's most uncomfortable. (And I've taken taxis in Melbourne, Cape Town, Damascus and the major European cities. It was part of my job as a journalist.)
The back seat of most New York taxis can accommodate three passengers -- if one is four feet tall and can straddle that protruding axle. My guess is that today's back seat could comfortably fit one pro basketball player, if traveling alone.
True, there are a few ''boxy'' shaped taxis now that do not have the raised axle, but I've been lucky in catching only two of them in the last 10 years.
As for the fare increase, I marvel at the number of off-duty cabs I see every working day, from 4 to 5 p.m., parked on Lexington between 53rd and 54th, apparently waiting for the next driver to turn up.
