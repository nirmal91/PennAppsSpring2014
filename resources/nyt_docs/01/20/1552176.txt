Q. Does the same food taste the same to everyone?
A. No, or the saying would never have arisen that ''tastes mostly differ.'' The same foods can produce profoundly different sensations, pleasant or unpleasant, for different people.
The taste buds are linked to nerves that transmit sensations of taste, temperature and touch to the brain. Scientists have quantified how taste is determined by the number of taste buds and their distribution, affecting sensitivity to the major tastes -- sweet, sour, salty and bitter -- as well as to things like hot peppers and the fat content of food.
About 25 percent of the population are supertasters, blessed or cursed with a heightened sensitivity because the concentration of their taste buds can be 100 times as great as the concentration in nontasters, who also make up about 25 percent of the world. Regular tasters, about half of all people, fall somewhere in between.
Supertasters usually find sweet foods unpleasant, because sugar is twice as potent to their taste buds. The same holds true for some strongly flavored fruits and vegetables, like broccoli and grapefruit.
Taste differences are mostly genetically programmed but can fluctuate with hormone levels. Also, damage to nerves in the brain can permanently or temporarily alter the sensation a food excites.
