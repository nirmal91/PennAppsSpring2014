A man died from two gunshots to his head that he received on a subway train in Greenwich Village early yesterday, the police said.
The victim, identified by the police as Silverio Rivera, 25, boarded a northbound W train at the Eighth Street-New York University station just before 4 a.m., the police said. Two other men, also in their 20's, boarded at the same time. It was unclear whether they knew the victim, a police official said.
There was an argument at some point, and the victim was shot twice in the head, the police said. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he died. He had no arrest record, a police official said.
Two guns were found at the scene, one of which was a small revolver capable of firing five shots, a police official said.
The two other men were stopped at the 14th Street-Union Square Station, one stop north of where they had boarded the train. Detectives were questioning them yesterday, but they were not formally arrested or charged with a crime, a police official said.
Under questioning, one of the two men, who has been arrested before, told detectives that the man who was shot had tried to rob him, a police official said.
The shooting came after a year in which transit crime dropped 13.14 percent from the preceding year, according to police statistics. There was a 9.85 percent decline in robbery complaints and a 15.18 percent decline in felony assault complaints.
At the same time, misdemeanor arrests in 2003 increased by 21.57 percent from the number in 2002, and fare evasion arrests increased 23.35 percent.
In November, in a confrontation that began on an A train and moved to a platform, Shamel Garrett, 21, was shot and killed in Queens. The police described that incident as a robbery attempt. Two teenagers were charged with murder.
