Two searches of Prospect Lake Park by police divers yesterday morning failed to locate the body of a man who fell through the ice on Sunday, the police said. The divers suspended their search because their air tanks were freezing. They plan to resume today, said Lt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. The man, who appeared to be in his 20's, was walking on the ice on the western part of the 60-acre lake when witnesses saw him fall in.
