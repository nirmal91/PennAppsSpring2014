The National Track and Field Hall of Fame announced yesterday that it would honor the memory of Stan Saplin, the track historian, with a permanent educational exhibit. Part of the exhibit will be Saplin's voluminous scrapbooks that cover the sport's history for three-quarters of a century. He died in 2002 at age 88.
An annual Stan Saplin Sports Media Award will also be established to honor a journalist, broadcaster, filmmaker or public relations executive who has made a significant contribution to the sport.
