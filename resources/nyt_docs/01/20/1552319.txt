The World Trade Organization's appeals body has endorsed American taxes on imports of softwood lumber from Canada on the grounds that low tree-harvesting fees levied by Canadian provinces amount to an unfair subsidy. In 2002, America imposed taxes totaling 27 percent on Canadian lumber, which is used mainly for housing. Canada challenged the ruling under regulations of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
