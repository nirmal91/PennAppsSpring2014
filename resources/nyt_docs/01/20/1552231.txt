To the Editor:
Re ''Alaska Thaws, Complicating the Hunt for Oil'' (Jan. 13): The thawing tundra might be a handicap to the operations of the oil industry, but its consequences could be far worse.
If the thawing continues for another century and gets deep enough, it could release a dangerous amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that exists as a solid called clathrate hydrate.
One expert has said that if global warming becomes substantially worse in the next century, then releases from hydrates could become the largest single contributor of methane emissions into the atmosphere.
