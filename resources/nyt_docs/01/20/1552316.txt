The jobless rate fell to 7.3 percent for October through December, compared with 7.5 percent for September through November. The rate of underemployment, people working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs, fell to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent for the same periods. It was the fifth consecutive decline in unemployment as the economy continues to recover.
