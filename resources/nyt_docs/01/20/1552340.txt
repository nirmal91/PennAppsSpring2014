Natasha Hastings of A.P. Randolph High School in Manhattan extended her undefeated indoor season yesterday by winning the girls' invitational 300-meter dash in 38.46 seconds at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Relays at the Armory Track and Field Center in Upper Manhattan.
In doing so at the meet, sponsored by the Public Schools Athletic League, she equaled the New York State leading time for 300 meters that she posted at the Bishop Loughlin Games last month.
