To the Editor:
Re ''Strong Depth of Emotion and No Frills in 2 Footprints,'' by Herbert Muschamp (An Appraisal, Jan. 15):
The final design for the World Trade Center memorial is moving and powerful, and the process that produced it has been vindicated.
Michael Arad had a strong basic plan that he was ready to improve. Peter Walker contributed dimensions of beauty and resilience. The selection committee headed by Vartan Gregorian intervened with what now appears to be a sage and measured touch.
All credit to them, and a civic raspberry to the cavilers and procrastinators.
