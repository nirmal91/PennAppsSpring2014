To the Editor:
The decision to incorporate physical remnants of the 9/11 disaster into the memorial plan is a sound one (news article, Jan. 14).
When I visited Hiroshima Peace Park, it was the skeletal dome, the twisted and charred tricycle, and the ghostly imprint of a person on a stairwell that seared my soul and expressed the magnitude of the horror of violent loss.
