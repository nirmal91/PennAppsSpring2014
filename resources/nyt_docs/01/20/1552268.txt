The Mexican conglomerate Alfa said on Monday that it would spin off its steel unit, which has suffered from years of weak prices worldwide, in a move that would cut its debt load by $1 billion.
Alfa said that divesting the unit, Hylsamex, would reduce overall sales by about a quarter but that net debt would drop to $1.3 billion from about $2.3 billion.
Alfa's shares rose to a four-year high, ending up 8.73 percent at 41.83 pesos.
Hylsamex pared earlier losses and finished down 4.71 percent at 7.49 pesos.
''The rise in Alfa's stock price says it all: that its numbers will improve by stripping off Hylsamex,'' said Estefaan Peeters, an analyst with the Accival brokerage. He has a neutral rating on Alfa.
Shareholders will vote on the plan as well as a reduction in Alfa's equity capital at a meeting on Feb. 4.
