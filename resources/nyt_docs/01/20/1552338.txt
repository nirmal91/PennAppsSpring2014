Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich is expected today to sign what his administration is calling the final piece of legislation in the state's overhaul of the death penalty system. The bill calls for the decertification of any police officer found to have committed perjury in relation to a murder case. Other bills that among other things banned the execution of the mentally retarded went into effect in November.
