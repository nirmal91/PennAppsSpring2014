An article on Thursday about plans for a wide release of Mel Gibson's film ''The Passion of the Christ'' misspelled the name of the distributor at one point and credited it mistakenly with the distribution of another film. The distributor of Mr. Gibson's movie is Newmarket Films, not New Market. ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' was distributed in the United States by IFC Films.
