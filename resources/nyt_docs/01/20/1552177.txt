A Dutch study released yesterday found that workers suffering from back pain returned to their jobs sooner if their rehabilitation included measures to help them overcome their fears of reinjury.
Back pain can linger long after the back has healed enough for the patient to resume regular activities. But many patients equate pain with danger and in effect learn to let their twinges dictate the limits of their activities, the article said.
The researchers sought to test whether this caution could be overcome by a program with activities that steadily increased in intensity. It emphasized that pain does hurt, but that it does not harm.
For the study, which was published in The Annals of Internal Medicine, they enlisted 134 KLM airline employees who had missed work because of lower back pain. They were assigned to receive advice on ergonomics and injury prevention or to the activity program.
In it, workers first were given back exams and assured that nothing was seriously wrong. Then they were helped to develop programs of general exercises and tasks linked specifically to their jobs, like lifting suitcases.
For the first three sessions, the workers were told to stop an activity when it hurt. The goals of the next session were below that pain threshold. After that, workers set their own goals for each session, and an overall goal of a date for full return to work.
The therapists assisting the workers were instructed to praise success and pay less attention to pain. The point of the exercises was not fitness but confidence, the article said.
On average, workers in the standard care group missed 87 days of work in the 6 months that followed enrollment in the study. Workers in the activity group missed an average of 58 days, even though they reported only slightly lower pain levels and slightly higher functional abilities.
