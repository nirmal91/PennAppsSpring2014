To the Editor:
Re ''When Banks Go National'' (editorial, Jan. 16):
With lax Securities and Exchange Commission and NASD regulators embarrassed by a hustling state attorney general, you recommend national commercial banks without recommending concomitant national banking laws.
Can state banking regulators effectively monitor national banks? Can federal authorities? If the lines of responsibility are not clearly drawn, then no one will be accountable.
