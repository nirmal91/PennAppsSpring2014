To the Editor:
Re ''Revised Ground Zero Memorial Will Include an Artifact Center'' (news article, Jan. 14):
Devoting so much of the World Trade Center site to a memorial is a concession to the terrorists. When a plane went into the Pentagon, it was rebuilt. If terrorists had succeeded in destroying the White House or the Capitol, those buildings would have been rebuilt almost as they stood. There would not have been vacant land with reflecting pools.
Visitors to the World Trade Center memorial site, especially those who were there before 9/11, will look around, feel the absence of those two magnificent towers and wonder, who is really winning the war on terrorism?
