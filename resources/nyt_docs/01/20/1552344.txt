To the Editor:
The epidemic of crystal meth use among gay men in our city (news article, Jan. 12) is indeed destroying lives and is partly responsible for the rise in new syphilis and H.I.V. infections among this group. But a just-say-no approach to crystal methamphetamine is not enough.
A harm-reduction approach to addiction must supplement an abstinence-based approach; otherwise we are in danger of abandoning the people we need to reach most.
Government and public health leaders need to declare the crystal epidemic a state of emergency and champion a comprehensive, science-based approach to treatment for active users, including additional drug treatment slots, strong prevention approaches for non-users, more research into better treatments for addiction and the money to make all of this a reality.
