To the Editor:
Re ''Dealing With Depression and the Perils of Pregnancy'' (Jan. 13): The symptoms of quitting antidepressants, like frequent crying, do not result from ending an effective treatment but from taking a brain-altering drug.
Many people who have taken antidepressants show symptoms of withdrawal, a risk that doctors should alert their patients to.
Ending a drug regimen should be planned and gradual. People who show signs of withdrawal are often advised to stay on their drugs longer, and this can lead to more severe symptoms upon future interruptions.
