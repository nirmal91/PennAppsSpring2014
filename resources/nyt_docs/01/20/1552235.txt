To the Editor:
Re the Observatory column ''From Dunce to Genius'' (Jan. 13): I was pleased to learn of the study on skipping stones because my own unfunded research between the ages of 10 and 14 never nailed down the precise angle -- 20 degrees -- for the maximum number of skips.
But the study neglects a crucial question: how best to time the waves?
