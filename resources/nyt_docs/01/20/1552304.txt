The Jets are expected to interview Philadelphia's linebackers coach, Ron Rivera, for their opening at defensive coordinator in the next few days. Rivera is available now that the Eagles are out of the playoffs.
The Jets will most likely offer the defensive backs coaching job to the former Giants coordinator Johnnie Lynn.
Coach Herman Edwards is in Mobile, Ala., for the Senior Bowl on Saturday. Last week, he said he hoped to name a defensive coordinator by the end of this week. That timetable could eliminate candidates from the Patriots' defensive staff. They cannot be interviewed until after the Super Bowl on Feb. 1.
