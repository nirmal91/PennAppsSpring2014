To the Editor:
Re ''Revised Ground Zero Memorial Will Include an Artifact Center'' (news article, Jan. 14):
The final design of ''Reflecting Absence'' reflects an unwillingness to emphasize meaning over style. Hiding the vault that will contain remnants of the trade center deep underground highlights how attached the jury has been to prettiness over relevance.
The very elements of this design that represent reflection -- the reflecting pools -- won't reflect anything if their surfaces are disturbed by water falling into them on every side. These broken surfaces will only reflect a broken selection process.
