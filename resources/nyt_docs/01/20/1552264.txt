To the Editor:
The addition of a grove of trees to the World Trade Center memorial (An Appraisal, by Herbert Muschamp, Jan. 15) softens the severity of Michael Arad's ''Reflecting Absence.'' Trees are a natural expression of the strength and endurance of the city.
I expect that careful deliberation will be given to the selection of the trees. The cascading form of weeping birches, for example, would be an elegant expression of the permanent sadness etched in all our hearts.
Their stark white trunks and elegant branches retain their beauty and grace whether dressed for spring or laid bare during winter. The balletic swaying of the birches would bring comfort and beauty to this hallowed ground.
