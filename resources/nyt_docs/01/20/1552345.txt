Re ''Despite Gain in Degrees, Women Lag in Tenure in 2 Main Fields'' (news article, Jan. 15):
The improving number of women and minorities among engineering Ph.D.'s is heartening news.
But engineering's male cast is far more than an academic problem. The lack of diversity at the design table has had societal costs: environmentally hazardous facilities disproportionately located in low-income areas, cars designed without consideration of female drivers' proportions and safety needs, and the profligate use of nonrenewable resources like fossil fuels, to name only a few.
Good design begins in the classroom. With diversity of thought, perspective and experience, engineering's inequities -- and clear dangers -- can be averted.
