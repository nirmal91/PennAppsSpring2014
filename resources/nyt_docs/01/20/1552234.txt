To the Editor:
Adult intervention is an important part of stopping bullies (''A Bully's Future''). The parent of a victim can help by calling the police, the principal, the teacher, the coach, social service agencies or even by speaking directly to the bully.
These calls need not contribute to the violence. They can be done politely, and they will be effective. I learned this from a friend who once saw a boy bullying his sister and simply told the young boy to ''stop that,'' which he did.
