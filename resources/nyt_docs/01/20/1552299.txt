State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi has thrown a wrench into the Pataki administration's plan to reduce the state and local bill for its pensioners, rejecting several proposed changes on Monday that the administration had hoped would save the state $500 million this year.
Mr. Hevesi said that four of the governor's proposals aimed at reducing the contributions the state and local governments must make were unconstitutional, because they would in effect weaken the pension fund over time. The state's Constitution bans the use of the pension fund to balance state and local budgets.
Mr. Hevesi's refusal to sign off on the changes means the governor has a new $500 million hole to fill on the eve of the presentation of his executive budget. The savings were meant to help close a $5.1 billion deficit.
It also means county executives and mayors outside New York City may not receive the $800 million in relief from spiraling pension costs that they had hoped for. The Legislature could still pass bills enacting the changes, but Mr. Hevesi's aides said he would fight them in court.
The comptroller's action does not affect the rising costs of pensions in New York City, which has its own funds. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been asking for another, lower pension tier for new employees.
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki's budget office, said, ''We hope the comptroller is not playing politics with something that is so important to local property taxpayers.''
But aides to Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, said he had no political motive for blocking the changes, which he believes would be struck down in court in any case. They said the governor's plan would in effect push off on future lawmakers and taxpayers the bill owed for today's pensioners.
