To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''A Bully's Future, From Hard Life to Hard Time'' (Jan. 13): The article notes that the victim of a bully should either walk away or insist that the person stop.
But as someone who was severely bullied as a child and went to schools that encouraged these measures, I can say that they did not always work. When my classmates and I acted on these recommendations, the adults in charge penalized our doing so as antisocial and fearful.
What will prevent today's crop of young victims from receiving the same evaluations when they try to follow a suggested and perhaps actually valuable strategy?
