To the Editor:
Re ''Revised Ground Zero Memorial Will Include an Artifact Center'' (news article, Jan. 14):
I love the design chosen for the memorial to the victims of Sept. 11. It is solemn and serious as a memorial should be. But I also feel that because of the flowing waterfalls, the site will be healing and uplifting. I'm looking forward to visiting the memorial when it is done.
