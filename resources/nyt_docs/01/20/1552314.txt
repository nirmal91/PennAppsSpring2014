Corporate bankruptcies fell in 2003 for the first time in four years, reflecting an improving economy and help of government subsidies. Last year, 16,624 companies collapsed, 14.6 percent fewer than the previous year, said Teikoku Databank, a research group. The debts left by those companies decreased 14.4 percent, the third consecutive slide. In December, bankruptcies declined 24.6 percent.
