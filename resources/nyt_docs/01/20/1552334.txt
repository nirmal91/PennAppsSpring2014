Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland, announced that their governments would begin a formal review on Feb. 3 of the so-called Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which created a Catholic-Protestant self-government in Northern Ireland. The review will also involve Northern Irish political parties and is expected to conclude by Easter.
