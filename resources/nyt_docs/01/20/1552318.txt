Foreign stakeholders in the Enron Corporation's stalled $2.9 billion power project, Dabhol Power, have offered to sell their 85 percent for less than half their original investment. Enron, which owns a 65 percent stake, and the General Electric Company and the Bechtel Group, which own 10 percent each, have offered to sell their combined stake for $380 million. The 2,184-megawatt power project came to a standstill two years ago when the sole buyer of the power it generated, the utility of the western state of Maharashtra, defaulted on payments.
