A small study released yesterday reported that giving men with hypertension doses of the hormone that helps regulate the body's inner clock lowered their blood pressure readings while they slept.
The researchers, who published their findings in Hypertension, a journal of the American Heart Association, gave 16 middle-aged men with untreated moderate hypertension 2.5 milligrams of the hormone melatonin an hour before they went to bed each night for three weeks. They also took a placebo for three weeks.
When the men were taking melatonin, their blood pressure dropped more during the night than when they were taking a placebo, coming closer to the normal day-night cycle. The lead author of the study, Dr. Frank A. J. L. Scheer of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the effect was about half of what most antihypertensive drugs produce.
If the results are confirmed in larger studies, Dr. Scheer said, melatonin may become a useful treatment that allows patients to avoid side effects from prescription treatments.
But Dr. Scheer cautioned that people taking blood pressure drugs should not on their own add melatonin until it is studied for reactions with other medicine.
