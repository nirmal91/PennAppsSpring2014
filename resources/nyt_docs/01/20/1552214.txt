Yigal Amir, who is serving a life sentence for the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, is seeking to marry a divorced mother of four, but Israel's prison chief said Monday that he would not permit it.
Reports of the wedding plans prompted outrage among Israeli politicians. Mr. Rabin's daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelosoff, was admitted to a Tel Aviv hospital with an irregular heartbeat after hearing the news, but was expected to be released soon, Israeli news organizations reported.
Mr. Amir wants to marry Larisa Trimbobler, described as an immigrant from the former Soviet Union who was divorced last year. Mr. Amir and Ms. Trimbobler, who the news reports say has a doctorate in philosophy, exchanged letters initially, and she was allowed to visit him.
''I really hope that with God's help I will have enough strength,'' Ms. Trimbobler told Israeli television. ''It's obvious to everyone there will be difficult conditions and this will not be a normal marriage.''
But Yaakov Ganot, director of the Prisons Authority, said that Mr. Amir had not made a formal request to marry, and that it would be rejected if he did.
Mr. Amir, a fervent nationalist who opposed Israeli peace negotiations with the Palestinians, shot Mr. Rabin in Tel Aviv on Nov. 4, 1995.
