Last year, the federal government gave doctors who work with heroin addicts a new tool when it approved a drug that blocks withdrawal symptoms. Now a small new study has found that a single shot of the drug, which has few of methadone's drawbacks, can be effective for as long as six weeks, opening the prospect of making heroin treatment far more flexible.
The study was published this month in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.
Methadone stops an addict's craving for heroin, but has been subject to abuse because it can create a high itself. As a result, its use has been generally restricted to clinics that require a patient to show up every day.
The new drug, buprenorphine, does not produce euphoria, even when taken in large doses, and it is more effective at blocking the effect of other opiates. Those qualities led the Food and Drug Administration to approve its use more widely, raising the possibility of treating patients in the offices of their own doctors.
In the new study, five addicts fresh from daily heroin use were given what the researchers called a ''depot'' formulation of buprenorphine. The drug is contained in tiny biodegradable capsules that float in fluid that is injected; the capsules slowly disintegrate, releasing small amounts over a period of weeks.
During four weeks of residential treatment and two weeks of outpatient follow-up, the patients reported few withdrawal symptoms and only mild reactions to injections of an opiate given once a week to test buprenorphine's power to block other drugs.
An author of the study, Dr. George E. Bigelow of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said that the long-lasting form of the drug would have ''less potential for diversion or abuse.''
