To the Editor:
Re ''When Banks Go National'' (editorial, Jan. 16):
What is ''healthy'' about banks getting bigger? For whom is it healthy, the banks? Individuals or corporate clients? The national banking system? Hardly. In some cases, sure, it may be much more convenient. But healthy? Not at all.
Considering the corporate scandals of recent years, and the complicity of some large banks in helping companies like Enron in their scams, making banks larger is not likely to reverse such behavior.
Will giving larger entities greater control of the credit card market be better for consumers and prod issuers to lower interest rates? Fat chance.
It took me nine days to resolve a mistake made at a national bank, in which another bank customer withdrew funds from my checking account. Bigger is not more responsive, nor more responsible -- just bigger! Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, who were wary of national banks, were not completely wrong.
