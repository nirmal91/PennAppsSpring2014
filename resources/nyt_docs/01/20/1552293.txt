A Bronx woman and young boy were seriously injured yesterday afternoon when a driver lost control of a car while being followed by police officers in an unmarked car in the Bronx, the police said.
The woman, 44, and the boy, 4, were hit when the driver, Korey Bullock, turned abruptly into traffic on Bryant Avenue from Westchester Avenue at 4:15 p.m., the police and a witness said. The police said that the car, a Buick LeSabre, apparently skidded on ice, hit the victims and crashed into a tree in a park on the corner.
Two police officers in a black Chevrolet sedan had been following the car. The officers had not accelerated, and did not have flashing lights that would have warned the driver they were police officers, a police spokesman said. They were observing and following the vehicle," he said, but did not say why.
The police later determined that the Buick was stolen, but said that no one had reported it yet.
One witness said he saw the boy lying under a park bench that faced the road. The woman, who was lying nearby, motioned for onlookers to help him, according to Hiram Caraballo, 32, an employee of Anthony's Supermarket who ran to the scene of the accident after hearing the crash.
The victims, whom the police did not identify, were taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in serious condition, the police said.
