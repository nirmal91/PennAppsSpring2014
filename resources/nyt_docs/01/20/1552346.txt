To the Editor:
Your editorial on Appalachian mining is rich in hyperbole (''Decapitating Appalachia,'' Jan. 13).
Far from being a unilateral action by the Bush administration, the buffer zone regulation reflects the policies of past administrations. The regulation also proposes a series of protections to minimize the environmental impact of mountaintop mining -- including carefully engineered placement of excess material that is excavated during surface mining.
From your caricature of modern mining, your readers would not learn that West Virginia is the third most forested state, where over 15,000 jobs are dependent upon mountaintop mining. While you dismiss industry's reclamation effort, the Clinton administration's interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, praised it in 1996 as ''in some ways closer to the landscape that existed here a thousand years ago with all its diversity and richness and water fowl and deer and big game and wildlife.''
