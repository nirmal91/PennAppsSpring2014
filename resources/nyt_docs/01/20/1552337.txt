Off-duty police officers pulled a woman from a narrow ledge on a ramp at the Manhattan entrance of the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday morning, the police said. The woman, in her 20's, had just climbed onto the ledge, 30 feet above the ground, when Officer Rafael Martinez, driving to work, stopped and approached her. She told him she wanted to jump because of problems in her love life and music career, Officer Martinez said. ''I told her being a star takes a lot of work,'' he recalled. Two other off-duty officers soon arrived, and the three men grabbed the woman and pulled her to safety, said Officer Michael Bazerman.
