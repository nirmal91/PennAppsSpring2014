To the Editor:
Re ''Revised Ground Zero Memorial Will Include an Artifact Center'' (news article, Jan. 14):
The memorial chosen for ground zero represents those in charge of the decisions for the rebuilding more than it does those murdered on Sept. 11, including my son, Carl E. Molinaro, a firefighter.
''Reflecting Absence'' is empty, void of honor, truth, emotion and dignity.
Gov. George E. Pataki, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Lower Manhattan community board and the panel that chose the design did not care about what the families of the victims want.
Shame on them all.
