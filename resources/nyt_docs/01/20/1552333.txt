The police arrested a 19-year-old German man on suspicion of carrying out a bomb scare that forced a Delta Airlines flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta to make an emergency landing at Shannon Airport on Sunday. The suspect was among the 147 passengers. A note saying ''bomb on board'' was found in a bathroom on the plane, which was declared safe after a search and continued on to Atlanta.
