The chipmaker Infineon Technologies said it earned 34 million euros ($42 million) in its first quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss of 40 million euros, despite an 8 percent decline in revenue. Sales in the period, which ended Dec. 31, totaled $1.62 billion euros. The chief executive, Ulrich Schumacher, said sales dropped as a result of price declines and the weaker value of the United States dollar. Mr. Schumacher said he expected stable growth for all business divisions in 2004.
