Because of an editing error, the schedules for three Democratic candidates for president were scrambled in the Political Briefings column on Saturday. Wesley K. Clark was in Holderness, Laconia, Manchester and Pembroke, N.H.; Howard Dean was in Council Bluffs, Mason City, and Sioux City, Iowa; and John Edwards was in Des Moines, Dubuque, Iowa Falls, Maquoketa, Parkersburg and Waterloo, Iowa.
