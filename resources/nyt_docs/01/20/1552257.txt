An obituary on Friday about the novelist Olivia Goldsmith, who died of complications related to anesthesia for elective surgery, misstated the date she entered the hospital. It was Jan. 7, not Jan. 14. The obituary also misidentified the first publisher of her debut novel, ''The First Wives Club.'' It was Poseidon Press, not Arrow.
