Japan's government raised its assessment of the country's economy and said the economy was recovering steadily. The government cited improving exports, consumer spending and capital investment. Policymakers expect Japan's recovery to continue on the back of strong demand overseas. The government warned, however, that the yen's rise against the dollar posed a risk to the recovery.
