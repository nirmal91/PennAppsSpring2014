Although Continental Arena is hardly the sort of place that puts fear into opposing teams, it is home for the Nets, a place where they have made their reputation as one of the N.B.A.'s toughest teams the last two seasons.
But even as they made their two runs to the N.B.A. finals, the Nets were merely ordinary on the road.
Now the Nets are about to embark on a challenging stretch away from home, with seven of their next eight games on the road. The Nets are hoping that their fortunes improve during the test. In the franchise's N.B.A. history, the Nets have never been at or above .500 for a season on the road.
This season, they are 9-9 on the road. But the Nets have also struggled at home, where their record is 12-8 and where they have dropped their last two games after fourth-quarter collapses.
Next on the schedule: games in Dallas tonight and San Antonio tomorrow, followed by a game Friday in Miami. The Nets will then return home for a game Sunday against the Boston Celtics, then they hit the road again next week, playing in Philadelphia, Orlando, Houston and New Orleans.
Starting in Dallas will be particularly rugged. The Mavericks have beaten the Nets six straight times, the longest stretch of futility for the Nets against any team.
Facing the Spurs the next night is certain to bring back memories of the Nets' failure in the finals last season, along with a one-sided home loss to the Spurs earlier this season.
In a minor personnel move, the team signed Robert Pack yesterday to a second 10-day contract. At the end of this contract, the Nets will be required either to release Pack or sign him for the rest of the season.
