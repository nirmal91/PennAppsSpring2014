HSBC Holdings, the financial services company, has begun a worldwide review of its advertising, marketing and communications accounts, which are divided among various agencies, with the intent of consolidating assignments to cut costs. Total spending was estimated at more than $600 million.
A spokesman at HSBC in London, Adrian Russell, confirmed reports of the review in AdAge.com and Adweek.com. ''Because its expenditure on marketing communications is substantial, HSBC has a duty to its shareholders to deploy its resources as effectively as possible,'' he said. A decision is expected by May.
HSBC is considering agencies owned by four companies: the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Omnicom Group, the Publicis Groupe and the WPP Group.
