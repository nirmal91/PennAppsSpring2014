To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Goal of Flight to Moon to Establish Base'' (front page, Jan. 15):
To some, the idea of pouring billions into a risky, unimaginably difficult quest to put human feet on Martian soil must seem sheer folly. To me, it is wildly exhilarating. This quest is the fulfillment of our human destiny as resolute seekers of knowledge.
Mars is there and we are here; we must go. It is also our life raft in the sky -- creating arable land and an oxygenated atmosphere can be done over a couple of centuries. Surviving on Mars gives me hope that we will survive whatever disasters we devise at home.
In staking a human claim on Mars, President Bush would stake his own claim as one of history's boldest leaders. I hope that his detractors don't kill the idea to hurt the man. They would just be hurting mankind.
