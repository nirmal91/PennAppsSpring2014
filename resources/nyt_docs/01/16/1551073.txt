Everything looks good at Sant Ambroeus: the waiters in their pink shirts and black pants, the pastries in the gleaming cases, the terrazzo floor, the mosaic on the wall.
Why would an Upper East Side Madison Avenue shop that catered to the ladies who lunch move to the heart of Greenwich Village? Because the laid-back Village is changing fast, and the area around Perry and West Fourth Streets is filling up with high-fashion designer shops. Sant Ambroeus, which opened there last month, is in its element. The shops attract just the kind of X-ray-thin women (and men) who prefer to eat in stylish surroundings with like-minded diners. Taste is the last thing they notice.
The food looks wonderful. It is all artfully laid out, like a photo shoot. Slices of veal in the vitello tonnato are arranged to form a flower, with the tuna sauce, no longer a sauce but a paste, mounded in the middle of the veal petals and sprinkled with capers.
Such refinement reminds me of certain expensive Milanese restaurants that have taken the soul out of Tuscan cooking. The veal was expertly cooked but without flavor; the pasta perfectly al dente, the pesto bland. The chef wouldn't have to do anything daring to fix most of the food. Just pick up the salt shaker. And add more vinegar to the salad dressing.
The sweets look all dressed up with squiggles of frosting and pastry cream from a pastry tube wielded by people who are experts at the art of decoration. But they have no taste. The biggest surprise was the gelati, for which Italy is famous: these tasted like sherbets from the supermarket. We couldn't resist the tiramis√π because of its description as a specialty of Milan made with zabaglione.
That turned out to mean overwhelmed with alcohol.
Sant Ambroeus seems to be a club for rich Europeans and for Americans who wish to emulate them.
Sant Ambroeus, 259 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 604-9254. Dinner entrees: $18 to $32.
