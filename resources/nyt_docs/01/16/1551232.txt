The Italian economics minister, Giulio Tremonti, has called for the creation of a new government agency to protect individual investors. In testimony before Parliament on the bankruptcy of the Italian dairy and food conglomerate Parmalat, Mr. Tremonti criticized the existing regulators for not preventing the Parmalat crisis. He described overhaul proposals that would include the creation of a regulatory agency and that would change the responsibilities of the existing agencies, which include Consob, the market regulator, and the Bank of Italy, the central bank.
