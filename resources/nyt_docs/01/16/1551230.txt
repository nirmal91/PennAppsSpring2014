Financi√®re Richemont, the maker of Cartier jewelry, Piaget watches and Montblanc pens, said fourth-quarter sales fell 4 percent because of the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen. The company's textile and leather business was the hardest hit, down 10 percent. Sales at the luxury jewelry stores -- Cartier, the group's largest business, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels -- grew 2 percent. Watch sales were up 4 percent and luxury pen sales rose 2 percent, the company said. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, had the strongest gains, up 4 percent. In Japan, sales fell 10 percent. In Europe, sales were down 5 percent from the quarter a year earlier while sales in the United States were flat. Richemont said that sales would have grown 4 percent if exchange rates had remained constant.
