Michael J. Gansas, the captain of the Staten Island ferry that crashed in October, killing 11 people and injuring scores more, spoke with federal prosecutors yesterday about ferry procedures, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Gansas, who until yesterday refused to talk to investigators or officials about the crash, spoke to prosecutors in the United State's attorney's office in Brooklyn, officials said. ''It was nothing to do with the actual incident; it was all about procedural stuff,'' one official said.
