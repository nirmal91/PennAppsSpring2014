THE music of Robert Schumann (1810-56) is something of a litmus test for performers. Quite simply, it tends to attract the finest, the most musical.
There are no easy effects in his music. Although many of his works offer technical challenges, they are not of the sort likely to wow audiences in and of themselves. Even in his concertos, there is little room for empty virtuosity. But lyricism is everywhere, and it works like catnip on musicians with real soul.
Still, the deep-seated affection of some is not always matched by a profound respect from all. It is easy to condescend to Schumann, to discount his stunning originality by attributing it in part to the meanderings of a mind addled by syphilis. A master of the miniature, he had relatively little success in large-scale ventures. His theatrical works and big choral pieces are little known. Even his symphonies have long been faulted for a perceived murkiness in orchestration and texture.
Yet those symphonies seem to be everywhere at the moment. Kurt Masur leads the New York Philharmonic in the Third this weekend in Purchase, N.Y., and at Avery Fisher Hall. Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin perform all four at Carnegie Hall next week in concerts that also include the concertos and other works. Teldec, meanwhile, has released recordings of the symphonies by Mr. Barenboim and the Staatskapelle.
All this comes just a season after Wolfgang Sawallisch presented the four symphonies with the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie. And that orchestra has since released its own recordings of the symphonies.
With this impetus, the classical music critics of The New York Times are encouraging a closer listen to Schumann generally, with recommendations of favorite CD's. Their selections are on Page 28.
