Danese Gallery  41 East 57th Street, Manhattan  Through Feb. 7
Done with the patience of a Persian miniaturist, the tiny, ultra-realistic paintings of Patrick Faulhaber depict low-end, nondescript burger joints, tattoo parlors and small-time beauty shops in Dallas streets and strip malls. Garishly illuminated by catchy neon and electric signs (among other intentions, the artist regards them as studies in light), they are said to invoke such far-flung influences as Northern Renaissance painting, Edward Hopper and the early films of Walt Disney.
''Keller's,'' a little beer and hamburger shack proclaimed by a large sign on a nearby pole, has a couple of S.U.V.'s parked before it on a rain-swept concrete apron, fronting on a long, dreary street, the whole bathed in the faint glow of a rainy sky. The blue neon-lighted windows of ''Smooth Groove,'' a tattoo and body-piercing place, cast a somber night light on the adjacent sidewalk and a lone parking meter. And so on and so on.
But the appeal of these blandly photographic scenes, if any, lies solely in their postcard tininess. Their inscrutability remains just that, failing to convey an atmosphere or sense of place. Not for a minute do they suggest the poetic anomie of Hopper's work.
