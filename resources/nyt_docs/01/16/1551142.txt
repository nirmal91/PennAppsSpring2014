Scene Gallery  42 Rivington Street, near Eldridge Street  Lower East Side  Through Jan. 31
The graffiti-based art and comic strips of the South African artist Conrad Botes feel right at home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Botes is one of the founders of Bittercomix, an underground zine published in Cape Town, originally in Afrikaans, now in English-language editions.
''Since I grew up as a white male under apartheid,'' he says in a gallery release, ''it makes sense to make art about hierarchy, abuse of power, domination, suppression.'' And racism and authoritarian politics are targets of ''The Big White Sleep,'' his first New York show, organized by Euridice Arratia, an independent curator.
The main attractions are two series of circular reverse paintings on glass. Done in flat colors and clean-lined graphics, each painting is a montage of figures -- soldiers, sexy women, cartoonish and religious icons -- overlapping and sometimes interacting in settings alternatively mock-celestial and scatological. The results are a little like 1980's David Salle, with the political intention more direct and the sexist content no less troubling.
Such work is, by now, familiar in New York. So to get a full sense of how raunchily subversive Mr. Botes can be, I suggest taking a look at the copies of Bittercomix on display in the gallery. Comic book imagery has been endlessly adopted and adapted by painting since the 1950's. But comics remain most potent -- which means extremely potent -- in their original, low-tech, intimate printed format. As such, they constitute one of the major and least studied modern art forms, one for which the Lower East Side is still a primary source and showcase.
