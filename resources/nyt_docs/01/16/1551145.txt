To the Editor:
President Bush's plan to establish a base on the Moon as a springboard for a trip to Mars (front page, Jan. 15) is a fundamental misallocation of energy and resources.
Millions of Americans lack health insurance, the public school system is facing tremendous financial shortfalls, and large public health problems like the growing epidemic of obesity deserve attention.
There is no point in shooting for the stars, or the Moon or Mars for that matter, if you cannot fix problems like these right here on Earth.
