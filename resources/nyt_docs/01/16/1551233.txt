The central bank governor, Pridiyathorn Devakula, left, said that the government would buy foreclosed assets from banks to bolster their bottom lines as it compelled them to consolidate. A new financial master plan requires banks to either remain small retail banks or become full-service commercial banks, a choice that analysts say will force many to seek mergers. The central bank said as early as last August that it was drafting plans to strengthen the financial sector, where bad loans remain a problem in spite of Thailand's economic boom.
