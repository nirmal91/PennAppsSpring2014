After 45 minutes of deliberation yesterday, a Federal District Court jury convicted Benjamin Harris, a temporary office worker from Crown Heights, of seven counts of tax fraud and filing a false return. His tax return for 2001 claimed that he had earned $9 million as a lawyer for the Temporary Time Capital Corporation and was entitled to a refund of $1.5 million, even though he had reported an income of only $1,061 for 2000. A refund check was direct-deposited into his bank account, but he was unable to withdraw the money and was later charged. In his defense at the two-day trial, his lawyer said the tax return had been signed by someone impersonating him. Mr. Harris faces a prison term of more than three years.
