Lawyers for the estate of George Harrison and for the oncologist they sued last week negotiated for four hours yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in an effort to resolve the case and put an end to the publicity surrounding it. The suit sought damages for what the Harrison family claimed was Dr. Gilbert Lederman's violation of Mr. Harrison's confidentiality by giving many interviews in the former Beatle's final days and after his death. A major goal of the suit appeared to be to force the doctor to turn over a guitar that he had his 12-year-old son play for a failing Mr. Harrison and that he reportedly coerced the dying musician to autograph. Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis said, ''The reputation, the dignity of all concerned is best preserved by trying to reach some early settlement of the matter.''
