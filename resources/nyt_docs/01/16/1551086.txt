To the Editor:
Re ''Putting the Sex Trade on Notice'' (editorial, Jan. 9):
As an attorney who represents trafficked sex workers, I have seen firsthand how this administration has failed many trafficked young women.
Under United States law, the government is charged with offering assistance to victims who are trafficked into the United States by giving them visas and other benefits that will allow them to rebuild their lives.
But the frequent requirement of cooperating in criminal prosecutions intimidates most victims from coming forward, and in fact many victims have found themselves aggressively interrogated by law enforcement officials as if they themselves are the criminals.
Add to this the general level of fear and distrust that this administration has created in immigrant communities, and the result is a law that allows the administration to market itself well but does not deliver all that much for young people around the world.
