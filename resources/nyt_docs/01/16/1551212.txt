The Houston School Board unanimously upheld disciplinary action against an assistant principal who was reprimanded and transferred to an elementary school after he publicly disputed official claims of significant improvement in the dropout rate at Sharpstown High School. The assistant principal, Robert Kimball, was trying to evade responsibility for failing students rather than confront the problem, the board ruled. An inquiry by education officials revealed that Sharpstown, which reported no dropouts during the 2000-1 school year, in fact had 30. It also found that the entire Houston district understated by more than half the number of its dropouts. Mr. Kimball said he would appeal the decision.
