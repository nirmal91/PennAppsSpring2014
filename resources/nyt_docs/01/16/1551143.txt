Zane Edison Barnes, who started as a telephone lineman and became the first chairman of what is now SBC Communications, died Jan. 9 at his home in St. Louis. He was 82.
The cause was complications of injuries sustained in a fall during a trip in 2001, the company said.
Mr. Barnes spent nearly 50 years in the telephone business. He became president of the five-state Southwestern Bell Company, then part of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company with headquarters in St. Louis, in 1973. He added the title of chief executive the next year.
When AT&amp;T broke up in 1984, Mr. Barnes became chairman, president and chief executive of the Southwestern Bell Corporation. By the time he retired in 1989, he had set the course for the company's takeover of other Bell offshoots, like Pacific Telesis, in 1997, and Ameritech, in 1999. Renamed SBC Communications in 1994, it is now a $46 billion worldwide telecommunications concern with headquarters in San Antonio.
Zane Edison Barnes was born in Marietta, Ohio. He started working as a lineman for Ohio Bell in 1941 before serving with the Navy in the Mediterranean and the Pacific.
He returned to Ohio Bell, received a B.S. degree in mathematics from Marietta College in 1947, and started his way up through the ranks. He held executive positions as a vice president in Ohio, and in Oregon with Pacific Northwest Bell, where he rose to president in 1970.
Mr. Barnes is survived by his wife, Lu L. Milles Barnes; two daughters, Frances Barnes, of Portland, Ore., and Shelley B. Donaho, of St. Louis; a son, Zane Jr., of Phoenix; a stepdaughter, Cindi Allen, of Redondo Beach, Calif.; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Barnes was active in the civic affairs of St. Louis and its region. He was associated with the Brookings Institution, the United Negro College Fund, the Conference Board and the Business Roundtable, among others.
