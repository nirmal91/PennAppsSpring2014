Sandy Noren, a gray-haired browser in the grand promissory mart called the Iowa caucuses, finally ran out of patience this week. ''I have listened to everyone stand up every four years and promise me the world,'' she declared rather wearily to Senator John Kerry, who happened to be the candidate making his pitch at the moment. Then Ms. Noren dared to pose the ultimate caucus question: how on earth could the candidate -- a good man, she conceded -- get all those promises enacted into reality?
The question was an unusual jolt of cold water in the otherworldly land of caucus-bound Iowa. Another dose of chilly reality was sloshing around in the state Capitol, where Gov. Tom Vilsack used the word ''sacrifice'' 12 times in announcing that after three years of withering budget cuts, it was time for tax increases to secure Iowa's future. Happily for the presidential candidates, their concerns lay in a gloriously fuzzy future White House, not the gritty certainties of Iowa's Statehouse.
Ms. Noren's query about reality hung unanswered as Mr. Kerry moved on and some other Democratic hopeful headed for Vinton with an equally long and expensive political shopping list. The news on car radios was all about a political universe even farther off -- in Washington, where President Bush was topping all promisers by offering a trip to Mars.
But rather than dwell on Mars missions or state taxes on the horizon, Iowans, like most Americans, seemed to prefer hearing the latest candidates make fresh promises. Nobody was clamoring for a dose of reality the morning after Ms. Noren's question. Caucusgoers happily crammed a meeting to hear a campaign pitch from the nation's ersatz president Josiah Bartlet, portrayed by the actor Martin Sheen. Signing pictures of himself in the virtual Oval Office of ''The West Wing,'' Mr. Sheen promised Iowans something better in the candidacy of former Gov. Howard Dean -- ''this wonderful dreamer from Vermont.''
