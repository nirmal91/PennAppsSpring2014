To the Editor:
The problem with President Bush's space proposal (front page, Jan. 15) concerns its timetable, not its goals.
On May 5, 1961, the first American was sent into space, and we reached the Moon only eight years later, on July 20, 1969. This was accomplished with a space program built from the ground up, with technology inferior to what we possess today.
Mr. Bush wants us to return to the Moon no later than 2020. There is no reason to wait that long.
As a college student hoping to participate in the space program someday, I would like to see more than a Mars visit by the time I'm 50. Americans can do better.
