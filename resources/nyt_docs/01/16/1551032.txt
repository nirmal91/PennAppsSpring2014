THE weather outside may be frightful, but you can still keep in tip-top climbing shape. Indoor sport climbing emphasizes shorter routes and bolted protection -- no need to worry about placing your own -- so you can focus on the most technically challenging moves. This gear will help you get to the top; it will also transfer smoothly from the gym to the rock face when springtime comes around.
