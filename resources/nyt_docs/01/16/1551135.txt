Luise Ross  568 Broadway, at Prince Street  SoHo  Through Feb. 28
You don't have to be self-taught to be an Outsider artist. Consider, for example, the Rev. McKendree Robbins Long (1888-1976), who made the zany biblical paintings on view here. Born into a well-to-do North Carolina family, Long studied for three years at the Art Students League in New York and briefly at the Slade School in London. With time out for service as an ambulance driver in France in World War I, he tried to make a go of it as a professional portrait painter, but then religious urges took over. In 1925 he embarked on a 30-year career as an itinerant evangelical minister. It was only after his retirement from active preaching in the late 1950's that his career as a painter took off.
Despite his earlier academic training, Long's painting looks self-taught. His easel-size illustrations of scenes from Revelation, teeming with muscular, cartoonish figures of God, Jesus, angels, demons, mythic monsters and souls of the damned, have generous, slightly crusty surfaces and a frosty light that gives them a slightly eerie, visionary quality.
More interesting because they are not tied to preordained iconography are paintings of an unknown ''lady in red,'' a buxom, Joan Crawford type whom Long envisions in one case as a forest goddess attended by butterflies, lounging fully dressed in moonlight by the side of a stream over which hovers a little rainbow. The goofy eroticism nicely complements the offbeat religiosity of the Bible paintings.
Although Long's paintings are well known in the folk art and Outsider Art worlds, this is his first New York gallery exhibition. It's worth a visit.
