One of the five homeless men who have admitted robbing, beating and raping a woman near Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 2002 was sentenced in State Supreme Court yesterday to 21 years in jail. The man, Victor Cruz, 23, and his four co-defendants pleaded guilty last month to sexually assaulting a 42-year-old woman they had taken to a homeless encampment near the park on Dec. 19, 2002. Officials have said the men also beat and robbed the woman's male companion. Three of the homeless men are scheduled to be sentenced next week and the fifth will be sentenced next month, said the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. Mr. Brown said that Mr. Cruz ''has been justly sentenced to a lengthy prison term for taking part in one of the most shocking and brutal crimes in Queens County history.''
