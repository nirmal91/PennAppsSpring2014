Re ''The Doctor Is Out,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 15):
My husband and I are busy, successful professionals and community volunteers with very different interests, yet we share many conversations about one another's work and activities. That is what healthy families do.
I also talk to my kids about soccer and certain other of their interests that I don't find exciting.
Many people are taking time away from their productive lives to volunteer for Howard Dean, but his wife's dedication to her patients is stronger than her desire to help him change the country and the world. That is troubling.
