To the Editor:
''Bush's Space Vision Thing'' (editorial, Jan. 15) betrays your lack of vision and unfairly paints the announcement about space exploration in political terms. Of course President Bush's proposal will help him in swing states like Florida and Texas. But if carried out correctly, it might help the whole country (and world) achieve the next level of civilization.
Mr. Bush's plan is not only sound financially, calling for a modest increase of $1 billion, with the rest of the money to be redirected from NASA's budget. It is also sound conceptually. By phasing out the shuttle, making the international space station a priority and calling for bases on the Moon, Mr. Bush has recognized that we need a sustainable scientific and commercial infrastructure before we can realize the potential of space.
