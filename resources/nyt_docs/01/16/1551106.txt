Nuclear inspectors arrived in the Netherlands this week to examine a shipping container from the Middle East that was found to contain a small amount of uranium oxide, a low-level radioactive material that can be processed for use in a nuclear weapon.
Dutch officials confirmed Thursday that representatives from the International Atomic Energy Agency investigated the discovery of about two pounds of uranium oxide, or yellowcake, found last month inside a container at a scrap steel company in Rotterdam.
Their findings have not been released.
A newspaper, the NRC Handelsblad, quoted an official of Jewometaal Stainless Processing, where the uranium oxide was discovered, as saying that he was ''99.9 percent certain that this stuff is actually from Iraq'' but officials of the Dutch government were more guarded.
''The only thing I know for sure is that this shipment was sent from Jordan,'' said Wim van der Weegen, a spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment. ''Anything beyond that is speculation.''
Paul de Bruin, a spokesman for Jewometaal, told the Associated Press that the shipment was handled by a Jordanian exporter he has known for 15 years, who insists the material was from Iraq.
Dutch officials said Jewometaal s employees and nearby residents were never in any danger because the uranium oxide was not highly radioactive.
Mr. van der Weegen said experts told him uranium oxide has to be refined using sophisticated and elaborate measures before it can be turned into enriched uranium for possible use in nuclear weapons.
Also, according to experts, Mr. van der Weegen said, the amount of material discovered in Rotterdam was too small to be of any use.
