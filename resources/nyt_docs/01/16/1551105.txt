He was suddenly being taken seriously as a potential winner of the Iowa caucuses for the first time in months, but that was not enough of a lift for Senator John Kerry on Thursday. So he took to the air, hopscotching across western Iowa in a helicopter to squeeze in two extra campaign stops -- and he even took the controls.
''Can you imagine? They have actually liberated the candidate,'' he said after leaving his handlers behind in the earthbound Real Deal Express, his rolling campaign office, pressroom and after-hours club.
''Rock 'n' roll!'' Mr. Kerry shouted into his headset as his six-seater took off from Council Bluffs at 9:20 a.m. ''If you're game, I'd like to fly it a bit at some point,'' he told the co-pilot.
Mr. Kerry, who was in the Navy in Vietnam, was the son of an Army Air Corps test pilot, and started out in Yale's aviation club. He took up flying helicopters in the Navy.
From Council Bluffs he flew to Carroll, where he took questions from 35 people packed in a farmhouse living room. Then, en route to his bus in Sioux City, Mr. Kerry grabbed the stick. Buzzing along at 100 knots, he joked about detouring to Aruba and recalled his penchant for aerobatics.
''I won't do a loop here,'' he said, to the relief of three journalists aboard.
Later, Mr. Kerry flew again, from Sioux City to Adel and Fort Dodge. On the last leg, he was subdued, declining to play pilot. ''I thought I'd just chill out,'' he said.
Or maybe, after four hours' sleep and four events, and with miles to go left in the day, he was just tired. Ten minutes into the flight, Mr. Kerry was out like a light.
