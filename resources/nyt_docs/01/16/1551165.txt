To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd writes that ''Judith Steinberg has shunned the role of helpmeet'' (column, Jan. 15).
Reporters who itch to ride campaign roller coasters do not approve that a spouse would prefer to keep the home fires burning and tend her own business.
Howard Dean and Judith Steinberg Dean have a marriage that is at once traditional and innovative. This is also the hallmark of Dr. Dean's politics. The balance has proved successful in the private and public spheres of their lives.
If Judith Steinberg Dean becomes first lady, I do not doubt that she will serve the country well. Until then, isn't it Howard Dean's prerogative to judge what sort of help he needs from his wife?
