To the Editor:
Re ''Gaza Mother, 22, Kills Four Israelis in Suicide Bombing'' (news article, Jan. 15): Supporters of the Palestinian cause have sought to win over world opinion by portraying the Israelis as heartless barbarians. The Palestinians themselves, even the terrorists among them, know better.
The suicide bomber Reem al-Reyashi gained access to her target by asking Israeli security personnel for medical help. Her attack succeeded by exploiting the Israelis' fundamental humanitarianism.
The bomber's objective, in her own words, was ''to knock on the doors of heaven with the skulls of Zionists,'' notwithstanding that she left behind two children, ages 3 and 1. What Golda Meir said years ago remains true today: peace will come only when the Arabs love their children more than they hate the Israelis.
