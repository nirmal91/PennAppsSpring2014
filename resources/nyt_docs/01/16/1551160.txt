To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd (''The Doctor Is Out,'' column, Jan. 15) takes Dr. Judith Steinberg Dean to task for not accompanying her husband, Howard Dean, on the campaign trail.
I doubt that Ms. Dowd would be castigating Dr. Dean for staying home and seeing patients if Dr. Steinberg were out stumping for the presidency.
I also doubt that if Dr. Steinberg were out country-hopping to do surgery to separate Siamese twins in third-world countries that Ms. Dowd would be so hard on her. Yet Dr. Steinberg is a woman who has chosen a career giving care to ordinary rural people.
In an era when medicine as a profession has undergone enormous upheavals, Dr. Steinberg has chosen to stick with her vision of her career: unglamorous, time-consuming but noble in its devotion to the basic health needs of her community.
As someone who has helped train many young women for future careers in medicine, I hope that she will be seen as a role model rather than as a political liability.
