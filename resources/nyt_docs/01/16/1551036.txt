IF St. Paul were a play, it would have closed the January 1885 morning that a visiting New York newspaperman reviewed the city as ''another Siberia, unfit for human habitation.'' Town fathers of Minnesota's capital city didn't even bother to write a nasty note to the editor. Instead, to prove that the know-it-alls ''Out East'' were just wimps, they planned an outlandish outdoor festival in the dead of winter. The annual St. Paul Winter Carnival began in 1886. This year's edition will be Jan. 22 to Feb. 8., and as always, will be a battle between Vulcanus Rex, the king of spring, and winter's King Boreas, for the future of a town where the wind chills often hit 40 below zero. A highlight this year will be the National Hockey League's All Star Game, to be held the last day of the carnival. Among the other attractions: a palace made of 27,000 bathtub-size blocks of ice (shown above being cut out of Lake Phalen); an ice carving competition, which begins Tuesday; ice skating; a giant snow slide (helmets provided); and opening day and closing night parades with elaborately outfitted floats. There is even an occasional famous visitor. In 1986, Prince crossed the river and played unannounced to a crowd that danced away in long underwear and fur caps. Standing in the sub-zero wind chill, the Purple One ecstatically declared to the audience, ''Los Angeles ain't got this!''

Friday
8 p.m.  1. Beyond Lutefisk  One of the brightest new dining spots in either of the Twin Cities is Heartland (1806 St. Clair Avenue, St. Paul; 651-699-3536), featuring French cuisine and fresh Midwestern ingredients. Both the pan-seared goose breast and consommé are prepared with South Dakota birds butchered by the owner, Lenny Russo; wild ginger is from the nearby St. Croix Valley; and ravioli is made with North Dakota wheat and stuffed with locally grown pumpkin, parsnips, and goat cheese.
11:30 p.m.  2. Last Call  Although St. Paul, adhering to genteel tradition, generally closes up by midnight or 1 a.m., the doors of the historic Turf Club (1601 University Avenue, 651-647-0486) aren't locked until 2 a.m. Opened as a lounge in the 1940's, the Turf is one of the premier local clubs for alternative music. Music is on the main floor; those who would rather talk can retire to the Clown Lounge on the lower level. The crowd is a mix of scenesters, fans of the bands and regulars from every demographic.
Saturday
9 a.m.  3. Where Fitzgerald Wrote  Tree-lined Summit Avenue is one of the best-preserved boulevards of Victorian architecture in the country. F. Scott Fitzgerald lampooned the denizens of this grand avenue street, which stretches to the Mississippi River, in ''This Side of Paradise,'' his first novel. Fitzgerald would know of what he wrote; he finished the book on the third floor of his parents' brownstone at 599 Summit, a feat for which St. Paul never forgave its most enduring author. The James J. Hill House (240 Summit Avenue, 651-297-2555), a historic house museum, offers guided tours and maps. Wander the streets searching out literary ghosts like Sinclair Lewis (vilified in his own hometown of Sauk Centre, Minn., for writing ''Main Street''), who lived for a short time at 516 Summit, and Donald Ogden Stewart, future screenwriter (''The Philadelphia Story''). In the summer of 1919, when Fitzgerald was working around the clock on his debut novel, one of his few respites were visits with Stewart at his quarters at Mrs. Charles Porterfield's Boardinghouse at 513 Summit, above.
Noon  4. Gather by the Fire  While Fitzgerald was finishing his novel, he would often go for cigarettes and Cokes to the W. A. Frost Pharmacy (374 Selby Avenue, 651-224-5715). The former drugstore, now called W. A. Frost &amp; Company, has four wood-burning fireplaces and is one of the area's favorite restaurants for lunch or dinner. Among the offerings are double-cut pork chops with grits and collard greens ($23.95) and braised beef cheeks with potato purée and spinach ($19.95).
1:30 p.m.  5. Public Enemy No. 1  St. Paul was the country's leading hideout for gangsters during the 1930's as authorities turned a blind eye to shady visitors as long as they didn't make trouble locally. Alvin Karpis, named Public Enemy No. 1 by J. Edgar Hoover, recounted in his autobiography that, ''if you were looking for a guy you hadn't seen for a few months, you usually thought of two places: prison or St. Paul.'' You can see where Karpis, Baby Face Nelson, John Dillinger and Ma Barker cooled off on the two-hour St. Paul Gangster Tours that leave every Saturday from 215 Wabasha Street ($20; 651-292-1220; www.wabashastreetcaves.com). Or design your own tour using ''John Dillinger Slept Here,'' a widely available chronicle of criminals in St. Paul by Paul Maccabee.
4:45 p.m.  6. A Visit to Lake Wobegon  Despite the tepid reviews for Garrison Keillor's latest novel, ''Love Me,'' fans of Lake Wobegon can still take heart that their favorite tale spinner hasn't burned out. His prime métier remains the radio, and live performances of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' can be heard many Saturdays at the Fitzgerald Theater, 10 East Exchange Street. Four consecutive Saturday afternoon broadcasts are planned from the Fitzgerald for March 27 through April 17; tickets ($22 to $32) are available at the box office (651-290-1221, www.prairiehome.org) and at Ticketmaster (612-673-0404).
6 p.m.  7. Jazz and Bison Burgers  For a quick bite, stop by the cozy Zander Cafe (525 Selby Avenue, 651-222-5224), a popular gathering spot to see and be seen by both the young and cool and the older and romantic. The Zander offers jazz on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and features a New American menu that changes weekly. Popular dishes include pepper-encrusted pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and red wine ($15), and a bison burger ($11), as well as an array of appetizers.
8 p.m.  8. An Evening on Ice  In 1993, the Minnesota North Stars, the Minneapolis entry in the National Hockey League, were hijacked to Dallas by a carpetbagger owner, as Minnesotans will tell you, tearing the heart out of the country's center of pucks. The city came up with plans for the arena that became the Xcel Energy Center (175 Kellogg Boulevard West). The N.H.L. was persuaded to award St. Paul an expansion team for the 2000-2001 season; the Wild is the first major-league team ever in St. Paul. Tickets are $15 to $76 and available at 651-222-9453 or www.wild.com.
Midnight  9. Edward Hopper Comes to Life  No trip to St. Paul would be complete without a late-night stop at Mickey's Diner (36 West Seventh Street, 651-222-5633) a 24-hour counter in a dining car. With round-the-clock breakfast, malts so thick you could eat them with a fork, hamburgers so juicy you can use a spoon, and waitresses so ornery you better know exactly what you want by the time they reach you, Mickey's could be the painting ''Nighthawks'' come to life.
Sunday
11 a.m.  10. Mecca for Shoppers  Save what is known locally as the Megamall for a stop on your way out of town. The Mall of America (952-883-8800, mallofamerica.com), the country's largest smorgasbord of consumerism, is a mile off Highway 77, near the airport. Some visitors might be so bedazzled by the more than 500 stores and the indoor Camp Snoopy amusement park that they miss their flights; others might turn around and flee the Las Vegas-like overload. You've been warned.
