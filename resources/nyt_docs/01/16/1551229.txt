Airbus became the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft by delivering 305 planes last year. It topped the Boeing Company, which had 281 deliveries, but it remained near the level of 2002, when it delivered 303 planes. Last year, Airbus won gross new orders for 284 jets, compared with 240 for Boeing. Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has a backlog of orders for 1,454 aircraft, which represents about five years of production at current rates, compared with 1,110, about four years of production, for Boeing. The Airbus chief executive, Noël Forgeard, said that ''for 2004, we expect the market to remain soft, with deliveries close to 300.'' In 2003, Airbus delivered its first A318 double-decker aircraft to Frontier Airlines and Air France.
