Edward Thorp Gallery  210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street  Chelsea  Through Jan. 31
By now Deborah Butterfield's skeletal horses, fashioned of found wood, metal and other detritus, are familiar to almost a generation of gallerygoers. Yet they still have a freshness, which comes from the artist's regard for them as individuals. In fact, training, riding and bonding with horses, as she does at her Montana ranch, she thinks of them as personifications of herself.
The horses and ponies that she portrays here are quiet but not unspirited animals, built up from the inside out with body structure -- flesh, bone and sinew -- indicated by wayward fragments of wood and metal. There is nothing cutesy about them; they seem to express the very spirit of equine existence.
Of the nine shown here, the largest and most impressive is ''Untitled 2728.1.'' Tall and imposing, head down, his right back hoof delicately poised as if to prance, this mount is made of long, curving rhythmic sweeps and arches of wood that define his haunches, belly and neck, with large apertures in between acting as positive space. He -- you can tell it is a he by his size; none of these horses are sexed -- has a truly grand presence.
