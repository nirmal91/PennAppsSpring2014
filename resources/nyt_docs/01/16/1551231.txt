The clothing retailer Austin Reed Group said its chief executive, Roger Jennings, had quit after a 22-week period when sales at stores open at least a year fell more than 11 percent. Total sales for the 22 weeks ended Jan. 10 declined 5.2 percent. Austin Reed, which is based in Thirsk, England, reiterated that it expected that full-year pretax profits before one-time charges would be lower than analyst's forecasts.
