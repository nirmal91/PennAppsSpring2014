To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Goal of Flight to Moon to Establish Base'' (front page, Jan. 15):
Spending billions of dollars to send astronauts to Mars in the current economic climate is like sending your child to space camp for the summer and then telling her when she returns that there is no money for her personal health or school books.
It's nice to have dreams, but President Bush gave up that luxury when he condemned us to decades of paying off the national debt he mired us in.
