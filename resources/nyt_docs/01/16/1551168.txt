To the Editor:
What does Maureen Dowd find ''startling'' about the photograph of Dr. Judith Steinberg Dean, in which, Ms. Dowd writes, the wife of the presidential candidate appears ''uncoiffed, unadorned, unstyled and unconcerned about not being at her husband's side'' (column, Jan. 15)?
Is it really so perplexing that Dr. Steinberg would prefer healing the sick to taking part in a media carnival?
