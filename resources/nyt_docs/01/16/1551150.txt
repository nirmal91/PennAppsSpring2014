To the Editor:
Experience has taught that manned space flight is expensive, dangerous and rendered largely pointless by advanced robotics (front page, Jan. 15).
Trust an administration that has entangled us in an endless, costly foreign adventure and is fast running up the largest deficit in history to seize on it as just the thing to throw money at.
