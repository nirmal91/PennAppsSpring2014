The Federal Election Commission is now facing the first big test of its gumption since the Supreme Court ruled decisively last month in favor of the new campaign finance law's prohibitions on the use of unregulated soft money in federal election campaigns.
On one side are campaign finance activists who charge that the law is already being subverted by illegal shadow groups that are set up to collect and distribute soft money, just as the parties did before the new law. On the other are the groups themselves, who say they are operating within the law. Much is at stake here, and the commission is obliged to conduct a painstaking investigation.
The issue was fully joined yesterday when three watchdog groups -- Democracy 21, the Campaign Legal Center and the Center for Responsive Politics -- filed a complaint asking the commission to investigate three of these shadow groups and to impose sanctions for any violations of law. The two Democratic groups named -- America Coming Together and the Media Fund -- have made no secret of their ambition to rid the White House of George Bush. The pro-Republican Leadership Forum makes no secret of its wish to keep him there. All three insist they can make the proper distinctions between money that can be legally spent on federal campaigns and the unregulated money that can be spent only on more amorphous purposes. This is, of course, the same defense the parties offered when they were raking in tons of soft money and funneling it surreptitiously to the candidates. The F.E.C. has to make sure that these new groups are not serving as conduits for soft money from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.
The key question, as always, is whether the F.E.C. is up to the task. In its decision upholding the new law last month, the Supreme Court noted that the F.E.C.'s halfhearted administration of the old campaign finance laws helped usher in the soft-money age. It would be tragic if the commission allowed that to happen again.
