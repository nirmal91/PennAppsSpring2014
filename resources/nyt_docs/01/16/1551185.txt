Foreign Minister Yoon Young Kwan resigned, accepting responsibility for a rift between pro-American officials in his ministry and members of President Roh Moo Hyun's staff who favor an independent approach in relations with the United States. Mr. Roh's office said that Mr. Yoon, above, had failed to direct and supervise the president's foreign policy while ''dissent and confusion'' could be seen in the country's diplomatic efforts. Mr. Roh was elected with the support of many South Koreans who view Seoul's ties with Washington as a hindrance to reconciliation with North Korea.
