Running back Stephen Davis of Carolina missed his second consecutive practice Thursday with a pulled quadriceps muscle, but he said he still hoped to play in the National Football Conference championship game on Sunday at Philadelphia.
''Do I have to play for the team to win?'' Davis said. ''They won without me. But I want to be a part of it. I'm a competitive person.''
Davis injured his left leg on Saturday in the Panthers' 29-23 double-overtime playoff victory at St. Louis. He left in the second quarter after a 64-yard run and did not return. Davis was replaced by DeShaun Foster, who will start on Sunday if Davis cannot play.
''It's very frustrating,'' said Davis, who rushed for a team-record 1,444 yards this season. ''I've never been in this position before where we're playing the N.F.C. championship game to go to the Super Bowl. I've never been in this position and I'm very frustrated, a little bit angry at myself. That's part of why I'm pushing so hard to get back.''
Davis has been having physical therapy, and the Panthers plan to have him back at practice Friday. ''To take a look at him,'' Coach John Fox said, ''just to get him involved in practice. See what he looks like.''
Fox said the Panthers would not announce whether Davis will play until about an hour and a half before kickoff.
