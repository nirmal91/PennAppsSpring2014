The three cases of SARS that have been identified here so far this winter appear to represent a milder strain of the disease, and the public health system seems well prepared to prevent a larger outbreak, a senior World Health Organization investigator said here on Friday.
Dr. Robert Breiman, the leader of a W.H.O. team, said that each of the three had been feverish for only 8 to 12 days, had only showed signs of pneumonia on X-rays for a week and had never required ventilators. None of the three appears to have infected anyone else.
''What we've observed so far has been a little on the milder side,'' Dr. Breiman said. He said that investigators here had found further evidence linking SARS to civets, a relationship first documented by Guangdong and Hong Kong experts and one that overseas doctors are starting to accept. At a restaurant where a 20-year-old waitress has contracted a suspected case of the disease, investigators tested cages that used to hold civets, a delicacy here, and found that almost all the cages had traces of the virus believed to cause SARS.
