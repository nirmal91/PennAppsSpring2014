To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Goal of Flight to Moon to Establish Base'' (front page, Jan. 15):
There is a tendency among progressives to assume that because the Bush administration has made so many bad decisions, whatever it announces can be dismissed out of hand. I hope that the space initiative is not so swiftly dismissed.
Space, like public education, should be thought of as an investment in our future. American education teaches our children to dream big. My young generation could so easily respond to the terror of modern life by dreaming small and unlearning the human instinct to explore. The country must respond by sounding the call to dream big as loudly as ever.
