President Vladimir V. Putin berated military officials for the death of one conscript and the hospitalization of dozens of others with pneumonia and respiratory illnesses after they were forced to stand in the freezing cold as their transport plane refueled in Siberia. In comments on Russian television, Mr. Putin said the incident, which occurred in December, showed ''a criminal attitude toward people.'' He called for an inquiry, and for punishment if a crime was committed.
