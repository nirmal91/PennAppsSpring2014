A leading animal rights advocate, Allison Lance Watson, was arrested and charged with making false statements to a grand jury investigating a break-in at an egg farm and a fire at a timber company, which both occurred in 2000. In papers filed in federal court in Seattle, investigators said a truck rented by Ms. Lance Watson was used in the fire case by an associate of hers, but in testimony she denied lending it to anyone. Ms. Lance Watson faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
