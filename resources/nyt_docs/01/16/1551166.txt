To the Editor:
As Maureen Dowd points out (column, Jan. 15), the time has come for Judith Steinberg Dean to emerge from her own career to be with her husband in his campaign for the presidency.
To have one's partner by one's side is of prime importance to the candidate. It is also important to many voters.
My husband, Jonathan B. Bingham, a New York Democrat, who died in 1986, was elected to Congress nine times. Our lives became inextricably braided, with his career taking precedence during our marriage's middle years, and with my career, as an author and playwright, taking precedence during the later ones.
There are two kinds of career: those, like science, in which the spouse's input is marginal, if not irrelevant; and those, like politics and diplomacy, in which the spouse's input may be crucial.
Dr. Dean switched from the first to the second kind, and it's no wonder that his wife wasn't ready to abandon her patients.
But I hope that at least for the next half-year, she will shift her priorities. Whether her husband wins or loses, I predict on the basis of experience that neither of them will regret it.
