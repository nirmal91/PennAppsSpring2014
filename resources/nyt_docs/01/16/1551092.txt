The senior judge looking into allegations that the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair exaggerated available intelligence on Iraq to garner public support for war will publish his findings on Jan. 28, his office said Thursday.
Mr. Blair was prompted to establish the independent inquiry by the suicide of a leading government weapons scientist, David Kelly, 59, last July. Dr. Kelly killed himself after it became known that he was the source for a prominent news article asserting that Mr. Blair and his top aides had ''sexed up'' intelligence findings about Iraq's ability to deploy and launch chemical weapons.
Through poisonous recriminations last summer between Mr. Blair's aides and the British Broadcasting Corporation, whose correspondent, Andrew Gilligan, leveled the charges about intelligence manipulation in late May, the case has become a referendum on Mr. Blair's credibility and leadership.
But the conclusions of the judge, Lord Hutton, could also significantly affect the reputation of the BBC, which saw its reporting practices dissected before his court.
In addition senior government ministers, including Defense Minister Geoff Hoon, could be affected.
''Lord Hutton's report into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly will be sent to the printers on Jan. 19 and laid and published in Parliament on Wednesday, Jan. 28,'' Lord Hutton's office said in a statement.
Though his report, said to run more than 1,000 pages, is being handled under tight security, Lord Hutton said all affected parties would be given copies 24 hours in advance, provided they signed an oath not to reveal its contents before it was formally issued. The full report will also be available online at www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk.
