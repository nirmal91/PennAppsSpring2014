To the Editor:
Re ''Fear of Beef'' (letter, Jan. 13): I am a meat eater! I eat meat four or five times a week. I eat roasts, steaks, chops, hamburger. Mad cow didn't really scare me, but after reading what they feed cows, I will stop eating meat. If the ranchers lose consumers like me, they are really in trouble.
