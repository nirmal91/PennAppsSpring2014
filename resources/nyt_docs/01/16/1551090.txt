A Moscow court rejected an appeal on Thursday by the jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky that he be freed on bail pending trial. No court date has been set.
The Moscow City Court's ruling upheld a decision by a lower court and said that Mr. Khodorkovsky must remain jailed until at least March 25, with many more extensions possible. Thus Russia's richest man will remain behind bars through the March 14 presidential elections, which the highly popular incumbent Vladimir V. Putin is expected to sweep.
Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest last fall was widely viewed as politically motivated retaliation by the Kremlin for his donating money to opposition parties and candidates and for conducting an independent foreign policy using his oil company, Yukos, Russia's No. 1 producer of crude, as a platform.
Mr. Khodorkovsky's lawyers argued that jailing him was excessive and that he should be put under house arrest. Mr. Khodorkovsky was allowed to speak on his own behalf by a two-way video link from Matrosskaya Tishina Prison.
Mr. Khodorkovsky said he was not a flight risk and that he had made several foreign trips during the preliminary investigation. ''I made it clear I would not leave'' Russia, he told the court, saying he could not betray those in Russia's political and business circles who had vouched that he would stay in the country.
''I did not hide from the investigation, and there are no grounds for thinking that I would hide now,'' he said.
Judge Olga Timofeyeva said the lower district court's decision remained unchanged, and Valery Lakhtin, the lawyer representing the Russian legal authorities, argued that Mr. Khodorkovsky should remain in prison to prevent him from tampering with the investigation.
''There's no reason to release Khodorkovsky,'' he said. ''His health allows him to remain in jail.''
Defense lawyers argued that there was no evidence that Mr. Khodorkovsky had tried to influence the investigation by prosecutors.
