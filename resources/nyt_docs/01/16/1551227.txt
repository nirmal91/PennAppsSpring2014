A fake advertisement created on a reality series is becoming a, well, reality.
Marquis Jet, which subleases flight time on corporate aircraft, will run a television commercial created by a team of contestants on ''The Apprentice,'' the NBC reality series featuring Donald J. Trump.
The episode last night was devoted to the outcome of a contest between the teams on the series to create a mock campaign for Marquis, which creates its (real) ads internally.
Three senior executives at Deutsch in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, judged the commercials and print ads created by the women's team to be better than the campaign from the men's team.
The executives' recommendation was accepted by Mr. Trump, who subsequently ''fired'' a member of the men's team for losing the challenge.
The 30-second commercial will start running next week on KVBA-TV in Aspen and Vail, Colo., said Ken Austin, executive vice president and chief marketing and business development officer at Marquis in New York.
Marquis will spend an estimated $100,000 to run the spot 150 times in the next month, Mr. Austin said, along with ads in daily newspapers and the trade publication Variety that promote Marquis's role in the episode.
