When not shooting fashion, style or news subjects, Jean Pagliuso's lens battens on grand old ruins and weird landscapes from California to Cambodia, from New Mexico to India and Turkey. She prints her images of palaces, temples, sacred places, desiccated land and odd bodies of water on handmade Japanese mulberry paper, sometimes split into multiple panels by the use of several negatives.
A result is a ghostly 19th-century look that keeps the viewer at a respectful distance, no matter how closely the camera regards its subjects: the intricate remnants of Angkor Wat; the texture of massive stone architectural blocks at Machu Picchu; a trio of phallic towers at Cappadocia in Turkey; the awesome sheer cliff wall that seems poised to fall on the tiny pueblo ruins at Canyon de Chelly in Arizona.
People, animals and other natural furnishings occasionally intrude on these otherwise static scenes. A solitary bather takes a meditative dip in Ganges River in India, his white garment floating around his hips. At Mono Lake in California clusters of eroded stone megaliths rise out of the water to form a chummy conclave. Flocks of birds skim a lake at the pilgrimage site of Pushkar, India. At the ancient royal baths of Sra Srang in Cambodia, the camera strikingly closes in on a giant stone Naga, or semi-divine serpent god, that rears its cobralike head over a shimmering pool.
More than anything else, these photographs convey a poetic sense of time, nature and the erosive processes of both, showing how they conspire against civilization to make beautiful ruins of the past.
