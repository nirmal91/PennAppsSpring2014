To the Editor:
The writer of a Jan. 11 letter who lost her wallet in Tokyo says that ''as a lifelong New Yorker, I was surprised when my wallet, with all of its contents,'' was waiting for her at a local police station.
Over the years, I have lost a wallet at least three times on the streets of New York. In every instance, it was returned to me with contents intact by the person who found it.
