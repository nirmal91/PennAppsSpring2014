Eight people have been arrested in connection with a New York-area crime ring that obtained driver's licenses and other forms of identification from the State Department of Motor Vehicles through the sale of fraudulent documents, the authorities said yesterday. Those arrested in the seven-month investigation include five current or former motor vehicle bureau employees and a civilian Police Department employee. They are charged with illegally obtaining fraudulent documents. In the scheme, brokers would sell fraudulent documents like birth certificates to clients who used them to obtain authentic identification, like driver's licenses, from motor vehicle employees in two Manhattan offices and one in Westchester, the police said.
