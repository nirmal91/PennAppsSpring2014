WITH two more months of winter left, indoor rock climbing is one way to fool the calendar, but some special skills are needed. Rock-climbing gyms require that you demonstrate competence in climbing and safety techniques. If you don't have your own gear (typically, you will need a harness, shoes and comfortable clothing that allows full movement), rentals are available at most gyms for $5 to $10; daily or weekly instruction are also offered, usually at extra cost. Here are some top rock-climbing gyms nationwide.
CALIFORNIA -- Mission Cliffs, 2295 Harrison Street, San Francisco, (415) 550-0515; day passes $10 to $18.
Members can climb here and at five Bay Area partner gyms. The more than 40 ropes and the ''Harrison Street Arch'' area have been host to several national championships.
COLORADO -- Paradise Rock Gym, 6260 North Washington Street, Denver, (303) 286-8168; day passes $10.
Along with a separate bouldering loft for strength and technical training, the varied and challenging routes -- numbering over 65 and changing weekly -- make this indoor rock climbing gym especially suited to more advanced climbers.

NEW YORK -- The Sports Center at Chelsea Piers, Pier 60, West 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 336-6083; day passes for the climbing wall are $50.
