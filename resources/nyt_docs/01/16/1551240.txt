A Queens man who the authorities say is a member of the Hell's Angels and a kingpin in a methamphetamine ring was arraigned yesterday on weapons charges after a cache of guns was found in his home, District Attorney Richard A. Brown said. The authorities said said that 41 weapons, including semiautomatic and automatic pistols, were found in the Douglaston home of the accused, Gregory Heine, while a warrant was being executed in August. The raid was part of an investigation of a drug ring that operates in central New York and involves the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, said Michael Arcuri, the district attorney in Oneida County, where Mr. Heine faces drug charges. His lawyer did not return a call for comment yesterday.
