To the Editor:
Frank Rich's acceptance of two realities would be a tonic for his agitprop criticism: God, or a semblance thereof, is here to stay in American politics, and George Bush is not the reincarnation of Richard III. If Mr. Rich would broaden his myopic view of our culture, he would be more objective in his analysis of the American religious experience. Like Mel Gibson, he too has his ''minions,'' and in placating them he is more demagogic than those he condemns.
