If the Super Bowl were running for president, it could probably hit a home run. (Oops. Wrong sport.) When it comes to this particular contest between teams of very large people, a sharply divided nation shows a startling near-consensus about the vital importance of watching it.
Americans don't just watch it, though. They talk about it, and talk and talk and talk. That brings up an odd little footnote to the game's vast economic impact. (Think ads, empty restaurants and beer sales.) Does all that talk cost something?
Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the outplacement firm that's ever ready to crunch the odd number, calculates mis-chievously that water-cooler Super Bowl talk will cost $821.4 million in lost productivity. So there.
