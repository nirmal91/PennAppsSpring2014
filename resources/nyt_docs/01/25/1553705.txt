On the day many Westchester residents were reading the article ''What's the Problem, Officer?'' (Jan. 18), our 16-year-nephew had been dead for five days and in his new crypt for two, the victim of a horrific traffic accident in a Denver suburb. In the words of the coroner, his Subaru Impreza did not stand a chance when it was hit broadside by an S.U.V. making a left turn. The police surmise the S.U.V. driver was trying to ''make the light.''
While this tragedy took place on a four-lane road, the apparent cause of the accident -- speeding, or ''getting somewhere faster than the speed limit or common sense would allow'' -- is the epidemic that threatens our communities. People will continue to die, be injured and/or severely traumatized by accidents unless and until traffic calming measures like speed humps are installed.
Many drivers, even when sober, appear to be oblivious to the lethal danger of cars, a problem compounded by the perceived safety of the high-riding S.U.V.'s. (Yes, the killer of our nephew all but walked away from the accident.)
In Irvington, commuters are treated to a hassle-free way to race to the train: no stop sign from the top of Main Street to any of the parking lots. Children who walk on Dows Lane to the elementary school never have to be reminded to walk on the sidewalk: there is none. Get hit by a car at 30 m.p.h.? You are probably dead. A sign on the north side of Bridge Street bridge warns pedestrians to ''Please Use Sidewalks.'' Happy to, once a sidewalk is actually installed on that side of the bridge.
Getting hit by car is the No. 1 cause of death or injury for children ages 5 to 14 (the State Department of Health.) Self-enforcing measures such as speed humps are the only way to force drivers to slow down.
