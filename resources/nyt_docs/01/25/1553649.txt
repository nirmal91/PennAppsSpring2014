Middletown's Board of Education has a committee investigating whether to change the name of the Woodrow Wilson Middle School. The situation came about after two students at the school complained that Woodrow Wilson, a Wesleyan University professor who became the 28th president, was a racist.
The 10-member committee, including school board members, community leaders, teachers and students, will consider evidence gathered by Andy Beatman and Vincent Crawford, two Middletown High School seniors. The committee will also conduct additional research.
Mr. Beatman, president of the high school student council, and Mr. Crawford, the vice president, became interested in Mr. Wilson after a social studies teacher made a passing reference to his racist views, a position shared by many historians.
In a letter to the Board of Education, Mr. Beatman and Mr. Crawford said that President Wilson used his powers as chief executive to segregate the federal government for the first time since Reconstruction and vetoed a motion calling for racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations. They also said that Mr. Wilson personally endorsed ''The Birth of a Nation,'' the motion picture that romanticized the Ku Klux Klan and championed the lost southern cause.
Rene Romano, a Wesleyan associate professor of history and the chairwoman of its African American Studies program, said the students' information was accurate.
''He replaced patronage jobs held by blacks since Reconstruction and instituted segregation in federal restrooms and cafeterias,'' Ms. Romano said. ''I'd probably conclude he's not the kind of figure whose name we want on a school.''
John Hennelly, the assistant schools superintendent and the chairman of the committee, said it might take several months for the committee to make a recommendation to the Board of Education.
The public will be invited to the next committee meeting Feb. 3 at 6:30 p.m. in the school board's administrative building.
