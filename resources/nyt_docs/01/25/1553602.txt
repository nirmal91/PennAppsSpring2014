ARE we in a fog?
Well, it's a little unclear. What is clear is that the phrase ''The fog of war'' -- believed to have been pieced together from a passage written by the 19th century Prussian strategist Karl von Clausewitz -- has touched a nerve.
If part of the art of war is adapting to battlefield conditions, the phrase has been well-used, to describe everything from war to mood to media coverage to Elvis and J.Lo.
Here is a sampling of how the phrase has been used in domestic and international newspaper headlines since the war in Afghanistan in 2002.
