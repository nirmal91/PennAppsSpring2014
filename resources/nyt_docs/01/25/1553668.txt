To the Editor:
As a lifelong resident of Bridgewater and a member of the Bridgewater Land Trust, the article about the Bridgewater Land Trust (''A Land Trust, Wealthy Donors, a Family Farm and a Big Problem,'' Dec. 14) provided both facts I was familiar with and perspectives of the participants with which I was unfamiliar.
The article did focus my attention on the central issue:
The entity we are talking about is the Bridgewater Land Trust, which, I believe, is dedicated to preserving open space and farm land in Bridgewater. I was not aware that it was also dedicated to serving the interests of individual donors in perpetuity. For the donors' generosity, I am deeply grateful, as, I imagine, are other Bridgewater residents.
Beyond gratitude, the donors also probably got substantial tax benefits for their contributions. The Fitzgerald family, one of the donors, also benefited by having their own property surrounded by land owned, protected and maintained by the land trust.
I would like to voice my support for William Stuart Jr. and his family who are trying to make a living in agriculture, a noble profession.
Thankfully, your article explained the issue the way it is.
