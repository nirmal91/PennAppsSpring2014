When Chris Obudho, political director of the NJGOP, addressed a Jan. 12 memorandum to ''Interested Parties,'' it's doubtful that he intended everyone to read it.
A summary of the memo, Political ''Best Practices'' Conference, discussed strategies for strengthening the state's struggling Republican Party. But it found an audience across party lines when a Web site, PoliticsNJ.com, obtained the memo and posted it last week.
''To be blunt, our party has had a dismal record in reaching out to minorities and women,'' the memo read.
It continued, ''We can change that without compromising our beliefs and values as Republicans.''
But it went on to counsel party members: ''Translate key Republican materials for distribution to non-English-speaking voters. Note: be extremely careful with translations! Have a trusted member of the community do the translation.''
Democrats in Trenton required no translation. Seizing an opportunity, they made copies of the memo and plastered the State House with them.
''There is nothing more refreshing than a Republican operative who tells the truth about his own party,'' said Adam Green, a spokesman for the Democratic State Committee. ''We should probably offer to send this guy on a speaking tour of N.J.''
