A SAINT, MORE OR LESS
By Henry Grunwald.
Random House, $23.95.
The titular quasi saint of Henry Grunwald's slim, elegant novel is Nicole Tavernier, a real historical figure in the life of Barbe Acarie (1566-1613), a Carmelite lay sister known today as Marie of the Incarnation. His imagined account of their relationship, played out against the backdrop of Henry IV's reign and the religious tensions that roiled France at the time, gracefully avoids all of the traps -- humorlessness, expository dialogue, the fetishization of manners -- that can make historical novels feel like homework. Instead Grunwald, the former editor in chief of all of Time Inc.'s publications, allows an ensemble of fully realized characters to carry the story along briskly. The provincial but headstrong Nicole arrives in Paris with a hunger to save souls, a knack for performing miracles and a mysterious past. She is hesitatingly befriended by Barbe (then married to a prosperous businessman, though already longing to take the habit), whose jealousy of Nicole ultimately leads her to implement a kind of religious sting operation in which Nicole's credibility is compromised and her life endangered. Thus estranged, the two women pursue their own circuitous spiritual paths until the opportunity for reconciliation arises many years later. For a book about the burden of faith, Grunwald's novel is wonderfully light on its feet, with characters that seem strikingly modern -- especially Henry, who exhibits a Clintonian mix of rakishness and earnestness, and Dr. Monnet, a humanist whose rational skepticism augurs the Enlightenment just around the corner.
