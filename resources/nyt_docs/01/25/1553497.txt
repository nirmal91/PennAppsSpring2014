Hero worship does work in chess. If you are excited by the style of one of the great players, don't just beam happily at his brilliant productions, by all means try to play like him. Take the current United States champion, Alexander Shabalov. He is a disciple of the late Mikhail Tal, as he has said. And one can see the characteristic speculative sacrifices inspired by Tal in many of Shabalov's games.
On the way toward winning the North American Open in Las Vegas, held Dec. 26 to 29, Shabalov defeated Zviad Izoria of Georgia in Round 5 with a sacrifice reminiscent of Tal.
With 3 e5, White introduces the Advance Variation, avoiding the classical Caro-Kann, 3 Nc3 de 4 Ne4, which, although yielding White a slight superiority in space, also lets Black set up a solid Maginot line on three ranks that is difficult to overrun. The thrust 3 e5 was once suspect for establishing a forward point without ensuring reliable protection for it (Capablanca, as Black in the 1927 New York Tournament, gave Nimzovich such a drubbing that it put volunteers off for years). But now a new generation of players has made it popular again.
After 4 Be3, several people have tried to upset White's plans by 4 . . . Qb6, without much success. For example, a Kasparov-Shirov game at the World Rapid Tournament in 2002 went 5 Qc1 e6 6 c4 Ne7 7 c5 Qa5 8 Bd2 Qc7 9 Nc3 Nd7 10 Be2 h6 11 b4 with advantage to White.
After 6 . . . a5 7a4, Shabalov prevents the further march of this pawn, which threatened to pin down his queenside. He cannot count on castling queenside, but then that was never part of his planning.
After 9 . . . Ne7, Izoria was ready for 10 O-O Nf5, to be followed by either 11 . . . Ne3 or 11 . . . c5. It was inconvenient to counter that in any routine fashion, so Shabalov played 10 Nh4!? Do you think he did not see that 10 . . . Ne5 11 de Qb4 12 Bd2 Qh4 wins a pawn? He is a brilliant tactician who likes to gamble.
After 13 O-O, Shabalov was ahead in development, and Izoria's queenside was underprotected. He doesn't usually need more provocation for a pawn sacrifice. After 15 c4, it would have been dangerous for Izoria to open the position with 15 . . . dc 16 g3 Qd8 17 Bc4.
On 20 a5, if 20 . . . b5, then 21 Rc1 followed by 22 Qd4, 23 Rc5 and 24 Qb4 recovers the pawn with clear positional superiority.
After 26 Ne6, Izoria had no chance with 26 . . . Rfb8 27 Nc5 Bg6 28 Be6 Bf7 29 Bd7 Rb5 30 Ra7 Ra7 31 Qa7. So he gave up the exchange at once with 26 . . . Qf7 27 Nf8 Rf8 28 f4 Qg6 29 Kh2 Nc8.
After 29 Kh2, Nb5 would have done no good because 30 Ra8 Nd4 31 Rf8 Kf8 32 Qa8 would give Shabalov a winning endgame.
After 32 e6!, Izoria's chances to fight were disappearing.
After 37 Qb5, there was no hope in 37 . . . Qb2 38 Re2, nor in 37 . . . Kf7 38 Qe8 Ke8 39 Rc8 or 37 . . . Re7 38 Rce7 Ne7 39 Qe8 or 37 . . . Qf7 38 Qc5. Izoria gave up.
