An article last Sunday about the actor James Spader misstated his experience with television. While his current role in ''The Practice'' is his first as a series regular, he has indeed acted on television before, in movies and as a guest star on other series. The article also misidentified the prep school Mr. Spader attended. It was Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., not Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.
