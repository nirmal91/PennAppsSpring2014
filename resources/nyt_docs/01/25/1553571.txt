For Sona Jasani, Rachel Kim and Pam Phan, being inducted into the National Art Honor Society at Morristown High School presented a chance to puff up their college applications. Along with the benefits of membership, however, came a few invitations to volunteer.
Before the school year is out, they and the 47 other members of the chapter will paint a mural to be hung in a nursing home. Even more challenging, these three young women, as the volunteer contingent for the winter/spring 2004 Open Art Workshop series at the Morris Museum, are leading a revolving cast of 15 to 40 3- to 8-year-olds in weekly Thursday afternoon craft projects. They also have to figure out clever ways to tie their crafts together with whatever is on exhibit at the museum -- a way of enriching young museum-goers' understanding of what they have just toured.
''For instance,'' said Tony Setteducatto, the museum educator who has overseen the program for the last four years, ''for 'Hip Hats''' -- a Feb. 12 installation in conjunction with an exhibition on the fashion designer Arnold Scaasi -- ''they will make hats out of colorful construction paper and decorate them with whatever crafty things we have on hand.''
Their biggest challenge will come on Feb. 26, when children who plunk down their $4 line up for the Googly-Eyed Guys session. ''That one is supposed to go with an exhibition called Eyes on Earth, about satellite technology,'' Ms. Setteducatto said. ''But for this we're giving them a collection of hundreds of large, rather odd napkin rings donated by a friend of the museum to work with. They're going to have to use their imaginations.''
The workshops, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., began this week and run weekly until March 11; no registration is required.
