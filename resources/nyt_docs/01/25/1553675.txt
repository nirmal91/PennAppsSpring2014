To the Editor:
The observations made by James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca (Soapbox, Jan. 18) about the affordability of housing seem to take it as a given that the state will need to find a way to make housing more affordable for large numbers of people who would otherwise not be able to find housing or afford housing.
Given that New Jersey is already the most densely populated state, where is it written that we must accommodate unlimited inflows of new residents and use direct or indirect public subsidy to guarantee a continuing supply of affordable housing?
Affordability varies greatly around the state. Legislative and judicial efforts to manage availability and affordability have often have been hijacked to serve the interests of developers and not communities. As result, I have serious concerns about the state's managing this marketplace.
Of even greater concern is the notion that the population needs to keep expanding. Is there a point where, as in an ecosystem, we are full? Sure, we can pave the state over with concrete and high-rise apartments, but is that what we want? Manhattan West? Messrs. Hughes and Seneca should address the natural limits of population growth in a region like New Jersey. Common sense suggests that we may need to accept some limits.
