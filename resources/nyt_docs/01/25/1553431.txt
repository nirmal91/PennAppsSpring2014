When Christopher Cruz was a freshman at Midwood High School in Brooklyn two years ago, he tried out for the baseball team and made it. But he had a problem: because the school was so overcrowded, freshmen started school around 11 a.m. and didn't get out until about 4 p.m., two hours after practice started.
''They rearranged his schedule so he could get out earlier, but even so, he had to skip some practices and arrive late for some games,'' said Christopher's father, William, co-president of the school's parent association. With 3,485 students, Midwood High School is well over its 2,133-seat capacity.
But a proposal to build a science and library annex on an adjacent lot has drawn fire from people in the community who say it would deprive two elementary schools and local residents of outdoor recreation space, and would fall short of relieving the overcrowding.
Late last month, after a public hearing at which the School Construction Authority presented the results of an environmental impact statement, Community Board 14 reiterated its longstanding opposition to the proposal.
''The annex wouldn't make a significant dent in Midwood High School's overcrowding,'' said Alvin Berk, the board's chairman, noting that the annex would add only 340 seats to the school.
Mr. Berk added that he thought the environmental impact statement did not go far enough to address community concerns, including increased traffic, noise and the loss of open space.
The annex, which would cost $21 million, would include science labs and a library. Separately, a bridge is planned over Bedford Avenue that would link it to the school. And the current science labs and library would be converted to classrooms.
Marge Feinberg, a Department of Education spokeswoman, said the project would leave most of the open space intact.
