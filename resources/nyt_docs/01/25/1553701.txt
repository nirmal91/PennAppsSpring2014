To the Editor:
Regarding the article ''Beyond Bake Sales: Nonstop Fund-Raising'' (In the Schools column, Jan. 4). After I spoke with your reporter, I found that much of the information that we discussed was absent from the article.
I am a mother of five children who all currently attend the Mount Pleasant Central School District, and I am a co-vice president of the elementary's PTA.
One thing your reporter might have written is that the hardest part of fund-raising for me is deciding which one of my kids will get to bring in the wrapping paper order form to school and making sure that any last-minute orders get submitted. Of course with five children, fund-raising gets to be a lot -- it would to anyone with multiple children in the schools -- but the positives far outweigh the donation envelopes, which I pointed out during the interview.
What I said to your reporter regarding PTA meetings was that my presence at the board meetings allows me to see firsthand just how important the PTA fund-raisers are. Not only do they pay for the Cultural Arts and Authors in Residence programs in our elementary school, but they also pay for student planners, new library books, fourth-grade yearbooks, Science Discovery Days, gym equipment, the Accelerated Reader Program and an end-of-the year barbecue and carnival. In addition, funds raised by the PTA also help to defray the cost of class trips and recently helped purchase digital cameras for each of our two elementary schools. While we discussed these points, none were attributed to me and some were only vaguely mentioned. The only impression one gets from that article is that in parents' views, there are no positives to the fund-raising that they are asked to support. Fund-raising is a necessity for most school districts.
