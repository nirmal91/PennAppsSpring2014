To the Sports Editor:
I write to you as a former and forever Brooklynite. I was only 8 years old at the time, but my soul remains seared by the loss of our beloved Bums. George Vecsey attributes the recent rebirth of Brooklyn not to the immigration of the nouveau riche, yuppies and Manhattan wannabes, but to a remarkable resilience of Brooklyn after O'Malley (may his name be disgraced) moved our Dodgers to L.A. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The spiritual destruction of Brooklyn and its aspirations for leading societal growth came in 1957. The destruction of Carthage was as complete. That the spiritually destitute buildings, parks and boulevards remained and have regrown reflects the fertile environment of Brooklyn, perhaps in its remaining people, soil and stones -- not in the subsequent successes of the finance of Manhattan's residents.
Perhaps Vecsey is not a Brooklynite (which should, alone, disqualify him from writing such drivel) or -- heavens -- is a Yankee fan. The Nets or another major league team may play a role, over time, in the restoration of some of the communal values in Brooklyn. As for its current economic revival, this is merely because Brooklyn provides a fertile environment for such a process. Let's leave the accursed O'Malley and his deed where they lie.
