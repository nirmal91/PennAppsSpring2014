To the Editor: Regarding ''What's Doing in Houston'' (Jan. 4): The startup of our MetroRail light-rail train will make getting between downtown and Reliant Stadium a lot easier during Super Bowl weekend. But there was no mention of the train in the article or on the accompanying map. Also worth mentioning are our revitalized downtown and the many great clubs, hotels, theaters and restaurants, like Zula and Quattro, that are very accessible thanks to the Metro.
