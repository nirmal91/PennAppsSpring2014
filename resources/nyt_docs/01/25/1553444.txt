Sunny Spain sounds appealing these days. If you can't hop a plane to Madrid, these Spanish restaurants offer a brief escape from winter.
AZAFRÁN  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 284-0577; 77 Warren Street (near West Broadway); $$$; Review 1/1/03.
The extensive menu at this unassuming neighborhood spot rests on a solid foundation of tapas, like poached artichoke hearts with sautéed onions, olives and capers. Entrées include lamb medallions encrusted with wild mushroom paste.
BAR JAMÓN  (212) 253-2773; 125 East 17th Street (near Irving Place); $; $25 and Under: 12/31/03.
Bar Jamón, whose name means ''ham bar,'' feels as true to the boisterous spirit of a Spanish tapas bar as you can find in New York. It lacks only a selection of sherries and the incessant smokiness found in Spain. Tapas selections include anchovies; smoked mackerel; bacalao with clementines and olives; and chorizo with pickled peppers.
BOLO  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 228-2200; 23 East 22nd Street (near Broadway); $$$; Review: 6/4/03.
After showing signs of slippage over the decade since it opened, Bolo is newly energized. The Spanish-influenced menu has been updated. And with the new tapas menu, the star chef, Bobby Flay, shows off his talent for expressing simple flavors clearly, with precise flavors. The restaurant looks like a glorified café, but the food says it is more than that.
1492  (646) 654-1114; 60 Clinton Street (near Rivington Street); $; Article: 4/10/02.
A boisterous brick-walled restaurant, for traditional tapas, like whole grilled prawns seasoned only with sea salt; dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped with bacon; grilled baby squid; or Spanish frittata with aioli sauce. Larger dishes like paella are also available.
MARICHU  (212) 370-1866; 342 East 46th Street (near First Avenue); $$; Article: 5/24/00.
Unusual Spanish and Basque dishes in a location near the United Nations draw diplomats and others interested in dishes like clams in a garlic and wine sauce, and tender baby squid served in its own ink. The eclectic wine list features a well-chosen Spanish selection.
SOLERA  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 644-1166; 216 East 53rd Street (near Third Avenue); $$$; Review: 4/8/98; Article: 5/24/00.
Solera looks cozy with its terra-cotta tiles and romantic lighting. The menu offers contemporary Spanish choices like grilled lamb chops with a ground lamb ''burger''; salt cod confit; and roasted loin of monkfish with a potato and leek stew.
SUBA  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 982-5714; 109 Ludlow Street (near Delancey Street); $$$; Review: 5/1/02.
Suba offers quirkily modernized Spanish cuisine. Appetizers currently include boneless grilled sardines fillets with chipotle sauce; entrées include grilled hanger steak with onion marmalade, served with paprika and cumin-spiced fries.
