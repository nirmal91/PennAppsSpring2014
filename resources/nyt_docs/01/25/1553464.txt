Despite solid corporate earnings reports, two of the three major stock market indexes fell last week, ending a string of advances.
The third market measure, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, managed a small gain. The trading week was shortened by Martin Luther King's Birthday on Monday.
For the Dow Jones industrial average, it was the first drop in nine weeks. The Dow fell 32.22 points for the week, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,568.29.
Eastman Kodak, which said it would shed more than 20 percent of its work force by 2006, was the Dow's best performer. Its shares rose by nearly 15 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index slipped by 16.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,123.87.
Quarterly earnings reports from technology companies were generally strong. Compure, which provides software for computer specialists, was among the Nasdaq's best performers, rising 17 percent.
The S.&amp;P. 500 rose 1.72 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,141.55.
The Treasury's 10-year notes yielded 4.07 percent on Friday, compared with 4.02 percent a week earlier.
