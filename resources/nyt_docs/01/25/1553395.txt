It's not easy -- to look chic while body-slamming a roasted turkey with Adam Sandler. But Brent Popolizio and Candace Bailey, hosts of Nickelodeon's ''U-Pick Live,'' seem to manage. The show, broadcast weekday evenings, combines cartoons with celebrity interviews and comedy sketches performed by Mr. Popolizio, 28, and Ms. Bailey, 21. On Super Bowl Sunday, the duo will take their act to the CBS Sports Studio for a pregame special at 11 a.m.
The pair's style is part preppy-punk and part vintage. ''Pink is my favorite color, and I love jeans with pumps,'' Ms. Bailey said. Mr. Popolizio gravitates to sneakers, jeans and tight vintage T-shirts. Here, Ms. Bailey wears an Urban Outfitters blouse ($40), Citizens of Humanity jeans ($168) and Bebe shoes ($130). Mr. Popolizio is in a vintage sweat shirt under a Sisley blazer ($95), a Diesel belt ($50), women's Seven jeans, which, he said, ''show off my svelte figure'' ($130), vintage Nikes ($90) and glasses by Ferragamo ($150).
Mr. Popolizio dreams of wearing ensembles by Marc Jacobs and Paul Smith, and Ms. Bailey wants to darken her hair. ''I've been trying to convince the producers,'' she said. ''They're afraid the kids won't recognize me.''
