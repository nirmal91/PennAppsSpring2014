Once again, the nation is getting an education about livestock feed (The Way We Live Now, Michael Pollan, Jan. 11). Seems we went through this before in 1998 with the Oprah Winfrey trial: front-page stories reminding us how we make our farm animals into cannibals and living sewage receptacles.
But where do people think all that industry byproduct is going to go instead? If farmers are prohibited from reincarnating their chicken manure into feed, local waterways could in some cases become waste repositories. As is so often the case with the problems of the meat industry, the solution is not a solution unless people cut back on their consumption.
