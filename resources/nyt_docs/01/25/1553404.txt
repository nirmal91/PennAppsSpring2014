Once in a decade, a fashion designer comes along with the authority to influence the way women dress. Such a talent is Tom Ford, the designer for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent.
Mr. Ford and his astute business collaborator, Domenico De Sole, together salvaged the Gucci label and turned it into a tiptop fashion brand. But they have decided not to renew their contracts (which expire April 30) with Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the French owners of both Gucci and Saint Laurent. The thought of the dismantling of this rare, proven collaboration has stunned the fashion world.
Just how important is Tom Ford to fashion? He put the sex back in. Unlike many top Paris designers, he never made theatrical, Ert√©-like costumes to grab headlines. His sensuously constructed dresses often commanded the most attention, but I always thought his tailored coats and jackets were more meaningful, displaying the talent of a fashion architect.
Mr. Ford describes himself as a designer who makes clothes that women want to buy, and I frequently saw them on the avenues. Pictured here, being worn day and night, are examples of his work for Saint Laurent, on the left, and for Gucci, on the right.
For Gucci, he had commercial success with 1999's coat with a stand-up collar and a tube belt, and 2003's corset-seamed, high-collared coat with buckle fastenings. For Saint Laurent, recent hits included last fall's ruffled coat and velvet jackets with satin bow closings. The 2002 taffeta and velvet jacket, near left, bottom, signaled a return to dressmaker softness in tailored clothes.
Mr. Ford's antennas were attuned to the energy of his generation. Last April, he greeted Diana Ross, above, at the ''Goddess'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You could see the electricity between them as they kissed, she shaking her magnificent Afro. Later, her exploding hairstyle showed up on the models at his fall show for Saint Laurent.
