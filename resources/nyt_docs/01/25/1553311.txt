I want to compliment Peter Maass on his article (Jan. 11). I agree that fighting insurgency in our role as conqueror/nation-builder is challenging and not guaranteed to succeed. But I find it reassuring that an officer of John Nagl's caliber has become a major player in our efforts to pacify and rebuild Iraq. May I add that this article does so much more to inform me about the current situation in Iraq than the unending news briefs announcing that another bomb has exploded, killing more United States troops and Iraqi civilians.
