The people in THE RED PASSPORT (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22), Katherine Shonk's collection of stories about life in post-Soviet society, can be roughly divided between real Russians and those who wish they were; natives trying to get out; well-meaning Americans trying to fit in; and some older types still trying to wake from the nightmare of the New World Order. ''Their desire to be in each other's countries hung between them,'' Shonk writes of a pair of couples, ''embarrassing and sad, as if the four of them were misfits who, full of false hope, expected to fit in elsewhere.'' Fresh from the Chechen conflict, Sasha in ''Our American'' plans to save his younger brother from conscription by marrying Amy, the cute girl from Ohio who works on a collective farm; the three of them, he thinks, will simply move to America. Temporarily stuck in Prague, an American named Rachel in ''Honey Month'' is faced with a painful decision: returning to her selfish boyfriend in Moscow or helping an expectant Russian couple desperate to get to America. Leslie, the American descendant of czarist-era nobility in ''Kitchen Friends,'' is so convinced she's a real Russian that she proclaims imaginary guilt over her ancestors' treatment of serfs -- a stance that cuts no ice with the locals. (''Russian-American, eh?'' sneers one. ''Like a dictionary?'') In ''The Conversion,'' a rootless American named Tom finds himself returning to Russia following a nasty breakup because he ''harbored a secret conviction that if he remained in America, he would always regard his time in Russia as the best of his life.'' In her first collection, Shonk sees these and other varied perestroikans with an eye both rueful and ruthless, sympathetic to their dreams even as she sees through them. She writes with the comfortable sense of one who has not only been there but taken a good look around.
