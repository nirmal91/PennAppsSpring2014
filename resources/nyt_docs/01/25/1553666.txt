To the Editor:
I have been commuting to Manhattan to work in advertising for 15 years, and I can sympathize with the tales of the commuting grind in the Commuter's Journal column (''The Ride Was O.K., but the Book Was Better,'' Jan. 4). Until recently, I've been able to walk to work from Grand Central. But now, I work downtown and I have added a half-hour of travel on the subway.
The contrast between the commuters on Metro-North and the subway couldn't be greater. Metro-North has the landed gentry from the gold coast of Connecticut, while the subway is a real melting pot. You get the young students in their hip-hop finest, steelworkers in their union local jackets, models who aren't yet supermodels and people from God-knows-where speaking their native tongue and the odd exec like me feeling terribly corporate.
There is also a wealth of musical talent in the subways. There is the Bruce Springsteen sound-alike who regularly compliments commuters as they march by. Last week I heard some terrific bluegrass fiddle playing by a quartet with dreadlocks. Then there is the businesswoman who belts out Madonna songs. She is evidently between jobs because she has an enlarged, mounted résumé next to her while she sings ''Like a Virgin.''
The two principals who own my agency also own the building we work in. Their commute is only 30 seconds, down the elevator. But I have passed through many worlds to get here, and they are missing out on all those brushes with humanity.
