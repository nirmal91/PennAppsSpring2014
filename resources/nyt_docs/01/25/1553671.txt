It's a matter of common sense. Will a child's safety seat fit inside a Prada handbag? No. You'd have better luck cramming a camel through a gold-plated needle.
Well, this month Governor McGreevey pocket-vetoed legislation that would have required parents to secure their children in safety seats while riding in limousines.
''The bill would have imposed the burden on parents to carry a safety seat around with them,'' explained Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for the governor. ''It goes without saying that we're talking about a relatively small number of people who use limos regularly. For those who do, it would be an unfair burden to have to carry these seats around.''
Current legislation holds drivers responsible for child safety seats without distinguishing between family cars and vehicles operated by a hired driver.
But is luxury an excuse for lassitude? And who should bear the burden? Not drivers, suggested Barry Leskowitz, president of the Limousine Association of New Jersey.
''A lot of our members have child safety seats, but we can't carry them around in our trunks all the time because the trunks for limos, as you know, are not that large,'' Mr. Leskowitz said.
Furthermore, he explained, placing the onus on drivers exposes them to excessive liability, particularly when patrons expect a chauffeur to buckle in their child.
''We want to make sure that the installation of the seat, and the installation of the child, is done by the responsible adult,'' Mr. Leskowitz concluded.
