RAPE
A Love Story.
By Joyce Carol Oates.
Otto Penzler/Carroll &amp; Graf, $16.
Early in Joyce Carol Oates's compact and potent new novel, a 12-year-old girl named Bethie Maguire witnesses the gang rape of her young and provocatively dressed mother, Teena, while the two are on their way home, after midnight, from a Fourth of July fireworks display. In depicting this event and its aftershocks, Oates's narrator addresses Bethie directly, forcing us to bear witness along with her: ''As soon as your mother and you were dragged into the boathouse at Rocky Point Park you began to exist in after. Never again could you exist in before.'' The effect is unnerving but never gratuitous, despite the novel's provocative subtitle and an opening chapter called ''She Had It Coming.'' Tabloid attention, public scorn and inept legal representation send Teena into seclusion while the patrolman who found her at the crime scene -- a gun-loving Persian Gulf war veteran named Dromoor -- attempts to provide the kind of justice that's beyond the scope of the courts. Although the novel's ending is abrupt, ''Rape: A Love Story'' gives us Oates at her darkly enthralling best.
