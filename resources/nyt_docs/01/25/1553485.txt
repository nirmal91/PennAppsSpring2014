To the Editor:
Today's scrapbooks, as described in ''Catering to a Love Affair With the Past'' (Dec. 28), seem far removed from those traditional repositories of yellowed clippings.
But both forms are products of engagement with new media. In the hundreds of 19th-century scrapbooks I have examined for a book in progress, I've found that Americans overwhelmed by the proliferating cheap press shaped the flood of print into usable form by organizing it in scrapbooks. Similarly, we are now surrounded by the flashing impermanence of digital images. Today's scrapbooks use and manipulate such images, but join them to the tactile qualities of paper.
Present-day scrapbook enthusiasts depend on snapshots to ground their scrapbooks in personal significance. Nineteenth-century scrapbook makers worked without photographs, often using impersonal mass-produced selections from their reading. Still, their scrapbooks had great meaning for them.
Scrapbooks leave a record of more than the memories pasted in them. They tell us what people thought about what they read and saved.
