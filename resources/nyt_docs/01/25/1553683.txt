Citing the effects of snow and extreme cold on train service, Metro-North Railroad temporarily changed its schedule late last week. The railroad has canceled and combined runs during morning and evening peak hours through tomorrow morning's rush hour.
''The snow and cold have wreaked havoc with major electrical components, traction motors, air compressors, train brakes and train doors,'' said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the railroad. ''There are no quick fixes. All of those have been done already.''
The main problem, she explained, is that last weekend's powdery snow continues to blow around and get inside the mechanical parts of the train. ''Different kinds of snow cause different kinds of problems,'' Ms. Anders said, noting that the last time the railroad experienced similar problems was in 1998.
Of the 600 trains that the railroad runs daily, 12 have been affected, with riders experiencing about 10- to 15-minute delays because of the schedule changes. The latest schedule is posted on the railroad's Web site, www.mta.info, as a service advisory and remains in effect through tomorrow morning's rush hour.
