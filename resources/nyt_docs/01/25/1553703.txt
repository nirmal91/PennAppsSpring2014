To the Editor:
I suggest a routine disclaimer from The New York Times that the Westchester Soapbox does not necessarily reflect (unless the contrary is true) the views of The Times.
Regarding ''No Easy Way Out'' (Soapbox, Jan. 11), Paul Wasserman's citing of the report from James Lee Witt, the former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is not unusual, but the thousandth citation of the Witt report will not make it any more credible than when it was originally issued. Its conclusion that current emergency response plans are unworkable is based primarily on a fast-breaking accident scenario with the release within hours of amounts of radioactive materials sufficient to compel evacuation.
There is no credible nuclear physics or engineering to support this scenario.
Current emergency planning training and testing conjures up extremely low probability scenarios just to exercise the evacuation components of the plans and the compulsion to evacuate is measured in days.
Alternative sources of electricity may not be sufficient to keep up with projected growth in the region and such outside sources as Conjunction don't support the metropolitan region's electric network stability.
Advocates of the idea that Millennium can cross the Hudson River to Indian Point where a gas-powered plant can be built are under-informed.
We can't afford significant additions to green-house gas burden. Such a construction effort adjacent to an operating or decommissioned nuclear facility probably isn't feasible. There isn't any margin to reduce existing electric supply.
We need even more nuclear generation to support a hydrogen economy.
