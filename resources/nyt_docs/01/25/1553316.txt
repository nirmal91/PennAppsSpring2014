The new rules forbidding the use of sick, ''downer'' cattle as food make sense. But it is important to note that even with the less restrictive policies we've had all along, to date, not one person is known to have been infected with the human variant of Mad Cow disease here in the United States. Why? Because the safeguards we have in place have been protective of human health, and are about to become even more restrictive.
