The Mets had offered pitcher Rick Reed a minor league contract with a spring training invitation, but yesterday he agreed to attend the Pittsburgh Pirates' camp as a nonroster player.
Reed, a 38-year-old right-hander, broke in with the Pirates 16 years ago. He had spoken to six teams -- the Mets were his top choice -- before reaching terms with Pittsburgh.
His agent, Phil Tannenbaum, was critical of Mets General Manager Jim Duquette for having another Mets official deliver the offer and for not negotiating directly.
''They made some offer, but to me, if it doesn't come from the general manager for a two-time All-Star, it's not valid,'' Tannenbaum said in a telephone interview Friday. ''Rick Reed will not be a New York Met because of the general manager. It's a slap in the face of Rick Reed.''
Last season, Reed was a career-worst 6-12 with a 5.07 earned run average for Minnesota. He had a 15-7 record with a 3.78 E.R.A. for the Twins in 2002.
