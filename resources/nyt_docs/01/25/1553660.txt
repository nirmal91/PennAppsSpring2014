To the Editor:
Re '' 'Passion' Film Is Incendiary, 2 Jewish Leaders Report'' (news article, Jan. 23):
If Mel Gibson's version of the death of Christ is ''as it was,'' then why all the secrecy with the screenings? Why the need for confidentiality agreements with viewers, excepting those Christian clerics who wholeheartedly support his position?
Mr. Gibson's not sounding too confident to me.
