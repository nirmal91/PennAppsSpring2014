To the Editor: The last two words -- ''freak out '' -- of ''Homework for Aspiring Divers'' (Practical Traveler, Jan. 11) could have been the focus of the article. The freak-out factor is what makes the difference between a disturbing experience and a deadly one. Things often go wrong. It's what happens when things go wrong that changes the course of events. Certain skills, like scuba diving, in order to be learned properly, must be learned slowly. Divers who have taken full certification courses (as opposed to quickie courses) and who have put in a reasonable amount of time practicing certain critical skills (like how to handle air emergencies) are less likely to freak out and more likely to survive.
Most dive shops rent equipment, and a fair proportion of their income is generated through equipment rentals. When something goes wrong and you're diving with equipment that's new to you, the probability of freaking out is dramatically increased. Finally, divers tend to maintain their own equipment with care. Many dive shops attend only to that which is conspicuously broken.
