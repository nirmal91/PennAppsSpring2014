Re ''George Balanchine, Musical Comedian?'' by Matthew Gurewitsch [Jan. 18]:
Nowhere in the Balanchine centennial chatter has it been pointed out that part of the inspiration for the maestro's revolutionary redefinition of ballet came from his appropriation of a black aesthetic. His musical comedy years in London, Hollywood and on Broadway were flavored and accented by the coolness, timing, acrobatics and unexpected movement juxtapositions that we call jazz dance -- our American euphemism for black influences.
Balanchine became an all-American. It's high time to acknowledge what that means.
