To the Editor: I read with great interest ''What's Doing in Santiago'' (Dec. 21). It is a city I have visited at least 10 times over the last few decades. But I was disappointed to learn about yet another annoying addition to the many discomforts of modern travel -- the $100 ''entrance fee'' for Americans. If visitors from other nationalities do not pay the same fee, I wonder why we must.
I have traveled extensively in Latin America and I do not remember other countries with such an expensive visitors fee.
I hope potential visitors to Chile are routinely informed about that fee before they travel, and do not feel unpleasantly surprised when they arrive. Such additional costs may discourage visitors.
