The Southampton Town Board has approved a $3.25 million bond, a major step toward completing its first joint land acquisition with the neighboring Town of East Hampton. The two towns agreed to split the cost of buying the 39-acre Poxabogue golf course in Sagaponack, on the Southampton side of the border, and East Hampton approved a bond for its half in early December.
Some East Hampton residents complained about spending so much money for land outside the town, but a petition challenging the bond issue failed to materialize before the 30-day deadline, according to the town clerk's office.
''Subject to dotting the i's and crossing the t's, I see no reason this shouldn't happen,'' said Dennis Suskind, the Southampton councilman who negotiated the $6.5 million deal. All that was left, he said, was a final contract with the sellers.
They include Leonard Ackerman, an East Hampton lawyer and real estate investor. He and the other sellers had sought to divide the property into 18 house lots after being denied variances to expand the golf course. Southampton officials balked at the original $7 million asking price, threatening to acquire the property under eminent domain laws instead.
