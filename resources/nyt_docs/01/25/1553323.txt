Your Ethicist correctly advises the owner of the golden retriever to pay the terrier's owners for the funeral bill. But while giving this good advice, he winks at readers by mocking the idea of an expensive funeral for a dog (''the Yorky's owners may be a pair of airheads'').
But why? Surely he knows that funerals are as much for the living as the dead. And that deep attachments can form between people and their pets.
