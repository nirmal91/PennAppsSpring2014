Rock music purists -- who miss the crackle and pop of listening to old vinyl records may want to snap up a pair of sunglasses by Vinylize, a new line of eyewear made from old LPs. Sturdy and nerdy, in a punk way, the heavy black frames ($320 at DisRespectacles in New York, 212-608-8892) have an acetate foundation fitted with a veneer cut from a vintage record -- thus confirming the vinyl album's status as something that is meant to be seen and not heard.
