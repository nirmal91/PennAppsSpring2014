To the Editor:
This article was of particular interest to me, having raised my two children in a New Jersey suburb, Ridgewood.
I am an urban creature through and through. Children in suburbia seem to be so bored with the nothingness of it all. They must be driven everywhere, which takes away their independence. They usually don't even walk to school.
Some young adults seem to be captivitated by the ''sleaze'' of the city, especially if they're living in an upper-class ''white ghetto.'' If they're exposed to a more diverse community I suspect they won't be as captivated with the sleaze, simply because on a day-to-day basis they will see diversity and realize that sleaze is not the only thing in the city. The city has everything, both intellectually and creatively.
