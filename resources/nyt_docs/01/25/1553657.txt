To the Editor:
In ''The New Electoral Sex Symbol: Nascar Dad'' (Week in Review, Jan. 18), Jeff MacGregor writes that ''Nascar dads'' are defined as being ''disaffected with politics and parties.'' Such disaffection often serves as an excuse for a lack of involvement in the process and hides a resentment at not being more central to it.
These days, there is a certain machismo associated with not being involved, because to be involved would align you with the elitists who purport to tell others what to do (that is, to lead).
Yet it is a self-satisfied and ultimately phony patriot who rises in the grandstands to sing the national anthem while complaining about those who have chosen to roll up their sleeves, to serve something and someone other than themselves, and to willingly enter the fray of democracy to work for, and not just sing about, freedom.
