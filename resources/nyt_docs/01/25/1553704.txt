To the Editor:
Regarding the article ''What's the Problem, Officer?'' (Jan. 18), speeding on residential and commercial streets is clearly a practice that has to be stopped. However, the 55-mile-per-hour speed limits on many major limited access highways in and around Westchester (Interstate 684 and Interstate 84 come to mind) are ludicrous. Such absurdly low limits breed disrespect for speed limits in general and may add to the problem at the local level. They should be raised to at least 65 m.p.h. And if elderly drivers don't feel comfortable driving on roads with such limits, they should exercise their better judgment and drive on roads on which they do feel comfortable just as I stay off ski slopes that are above my (limited) level of skill.
