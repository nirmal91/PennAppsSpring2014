To the Editor:
In ''The Garden State Honors One of Its Own'' (Jan. 18), on the selection of the blueberry as the official state fruit, you say that not even the U.S.D.A. could tell whether the tomato was really a fruit. But it is a fruit. The tomato is a reproductive structure in the plant. It is the ripened ovary and contains seeds to perpetuate the species. Fruits should not be confused with vegetables, which constitute the roots, stem or leaf of the plant.
