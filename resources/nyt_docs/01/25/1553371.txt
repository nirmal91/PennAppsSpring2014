To the Editor: Regarding ''Homage to Patagonia'' (Jan. 4): I visited Patagonia on a trekking trip in 1988, before the current crowds of tourists arrived. I agree that the Perito Moreno glacier is worth a visit. We were told that there was a three-year cycle of ice build-up and that in the third year, the rotura (rupture) of calving ice was especially dramatic. If so, it would be well worth trying to time a visit around it, although admittedly difficult as to a specific week.
