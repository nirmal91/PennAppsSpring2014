The smart drink at an apr√®s-ski bar facing the slopes is Taylor Fladgate's First Estate, an entry-level port. A hedonist's delight, this Portuguese red tastes of sun-dazed red grapes, cocoa, powdered chocolate, macerated berries, stewed prunes and raisins. Its warming depths offer clues to vintage ports that are worth diamonds.
Astor Wines, 12 Astor Place (Lafayette Street), charges $16.
