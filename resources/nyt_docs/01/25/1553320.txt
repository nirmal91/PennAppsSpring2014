As a pediatrician and well-adjusted atheist, I have this advice for Dana Tierney: You may learn many important lessons from your 4-year-old son, but don't be misled into thinking that his fantastical musings about some Grand Overseer implore you to join him at his concrete mental level (Lives, Jan. 11). Remember that all people -- believers in God certainly included -- need introspection and motivation to find purpose in life. The exigencies of the physical world are all the stimulus I need to do my part, simply because it makes me and those I touch better.
