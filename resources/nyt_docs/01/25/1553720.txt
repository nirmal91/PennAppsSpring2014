Re ''Nets Are Sold for $300 Million, and Dream Grows in Brooklyn'' (Jan. 22):
A better headline for your story on Bruce C. Ratner's plan to raze 10 acres of private property in order to build an unnecessary and unwanted stadium would be ''A Nightmare Grows in Brooklyn.''
Traffic on Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues is already strained to the breaking point. And study after study has shown that sports facilities do not benefit local economies -- indeed, often the reverse. Brooklynites have been doing a spectacular job of revitalizing our beloved borough without the disruption, noise and pollution sure to stem from a white-elephant project like this.
