THE GRENADILLO BOX
By Janet Gleeson.
Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.
The British writer Janet Gleeson's first novel casts Nathaniel Hopson, journeyman to the gifted cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale, as a reluctant but astute detective. Hopson travels from Chippendale's hectic workshop in London to the country house of Lord Montfort, where he has been dispatched to outfit a library. When Montfort is found dead, Hopson is commissioned to determine the cause. (The suspects include Madame Trenti, an actress of dubious reputation, and Chippendale himself, whose ambition yields a coldly single-minded character.) Hopson's colorful narration is marked by his intermittent class frustrations as well as a craftsmanlike eye for detail, yet few of the other characters move beyond their initial flatness. Gleeson's novel benefits from her familiarity with her subject matter -- she is an antiques expert who has worked at Sotheby's and is best known for ''The Arcanum,'' a history of European porcelain. Her knowledge is evident in a description of the various woods in Chippendale's shop; a footman's account of the types of coaches in a noble family's possession; and startling details such as a lady's ''perfectly arched mouse-hair brow.''
