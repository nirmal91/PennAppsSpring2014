To the Editor:
Frank Rich's comments concerning ''hard-knuckle religious politics'' were right on target, and his term ''spiritual McCarthyism'' defines them to a T [''The Pope's Thumbs Up for Gibson's 'Passion,' '' Jan. 18]. Perhaps Mel Gibson's ''Passion'' could only happen in an age of malicious sanctimony. However, Mr. Rich's repeated coverage of the film probably gives it far more weight than it deserves.
As a gay man, I've lived through the obnoxious rantings of televangelists who demonize my lifestyle because doing so justifies their own positions. I miss the time when religion was practiced quietly, privately and humbly. What I truly resent is when Christian conservatives co-opt Christianity to persecute others. However, Mr. Gibson's ''Passion'' will probably prove a tepid tempest in a teapot, and the less said about a film of a well-known story whose only novelties are its graphic violence and Latin-Aramaic dialogue, the better. If I want to see a good film about the Passion, there's always Pasolini's ''Gospel According to St. Matthew,'' a fine religious film by a gay director.
