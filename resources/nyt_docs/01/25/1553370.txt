To the Editor: I read Mary-Lou Weisman's piece on fanatical fans of Admiral Lord Nelson, ''Master, Commander and Me'' (Jan. 4), with interest.
I am sure that spending a vacation in the company of such people may well be very trying, but that is no reason to misrepresent the English town of Chatham so grievously. Nelson started his naval career in Chatham and built his flagship there. But Ms. Weisman remarks that those were not reasons enough to visit the ''dismal'' place. I agree. Chatham, however, has more than memories to offer. It has perhaps the finest 18th-century naval dockyard in Britain, containing unique buildings and vessels. Also, the town is ringed by a series of spectacular forts built on and beneath the chalk hills to defend the dock from Napoleon's armies.
