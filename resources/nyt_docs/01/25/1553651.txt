To the Editor:
Re ''Workers Assail Night Lock-Ins by Wal-Mart'' (front page, Jan. 18):
Because of Wal-Mart's policy of locking up employees at night, jeopardizing their health and safety, and policies that thwart the right to organize, I have yet to walk through those same doors when they are open.
