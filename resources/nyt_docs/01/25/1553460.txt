THERE are ways to get around the sometimes long wait for a popular car. Following are a few suggestions from auto experts:
Surf the Web. The Internet has made researching cars easier, but it can also be invaluable for finding hard-to-get vehicles. AutoTrader.com may be a good place to start the search; more dealers are using the site to sell new cars. Many sites also let you search by ZIP code, so you can find dealers outside your area.
Get in line. Before a car is even available, put your name on dealers' waiting lists. In some cases, you may have to put down a deposit. (Don't forget to get the deposit back if you change your mind, or have it deducted from the price after the sale is completed.)
Get to know the dealer. By building a relationship with a dealer, you can find out when certain models will be delivered, or when waiting lists will be created.
Comb the lots. If you're willing to compromise on the color and options, you may not have to wait.
Take a road trip. Find out where the car you want is less popular. You may have to travel to a dealership in a faraway city or hire someone to deliver the car to you.
