To the Editor:
Your article ''The Emerald City'' (Jan. 11) captures perfectly the ambiguity that I, a lifelong New Jersey resident, have always felt toward New York. The feeling is never stronger than it is the moment the DeCamp bus pulls out of the tunnel and I am transported into another universe, so vastly different from the suburban landscape of Essex County.
I applaud the teen-agers mentioned in the article for their bravery, and I empathize with their fears. To this day I feel that I am dressed inappropriately every time I go into New York, especially downtown. But I keep going.
