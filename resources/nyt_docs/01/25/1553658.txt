Re ''The New Electoral Sex Symbol: Nascar Dad,'' by Jeff MacGregor (Week in Review, Jan. 18):
Using the term ''Nascar dad'' for a swing voter the way ''soccer mom'' has been used implies that going to Nascar events has something to do with being a father in the same way that chauffeuring kids to soccer practices and games has become part of being a mother.
These are not Nascar ''dads''; they are just Nascar guys.
