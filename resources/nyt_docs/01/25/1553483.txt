Some successful real estate agents use the hard sell to close big deals. Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead, a real estate firm on Long Island that specializes in multimillion-dollar houses, is more subtle.
Before entering the real estate field 17 years ago, Ms. Saatchi was a psychiatric occupational therapist for more than 18 years. That training has come in handy for her second career. ''I think there's a peculiar psychosis among people who are buying or selling their homes,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ''There are a lot of emotional issues wrapped up in where one lives.''
So Ms. Saatchi's approach is to sit back and listen, often taking notes, when clients wrestle with decisions about making a house purchase.
This strategy proved effective recently, when a wealthy investment banker from Manhattan was searching for a second home in the Hamptons. After working with the man for several weeks, Ms. Saatchi said, he told her a childhood story. Every Sunday, his father would take the family to search for vacation homes but was never able to pull the trigger and acquire one.
''He said he was determined to be different, and that he was actually going to buy one,'' she said.
Once the man made an offer on a house, however, ''days went by, and he stopped returning my phone calls,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ''He couldn't explain it,'' she added, ''but he just couldn't sign the contract.''
Knowing the man's history, Ms. Saatchi said she called his bluff. ''I couldn't help myself,'' she said. ''I called him up and said, 'You are destined to be just like your father,''' she said. ''Without a word, he hung up the phone.''
A few days later, though, it appears that her words had had an effect. ''He called me to tell me that his psychiatrist appreciated my help,'' she said. ''And then he signed the contract.''
