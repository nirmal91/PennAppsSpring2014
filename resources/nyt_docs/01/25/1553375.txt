To the Editor: In ''Airlines and U.S. in a Bag Battle'' (Practical Traveler, Dec. 14), Susan Stellin rightly decries the high price of shipping baggage in the United States.
This should be contrasted with the highly developed takyubin (delivery) system in Japan, where for 2,000 yen or so (about $19) one can ship a bag almost anywhere in Japan overnight. The services pick up and deliver -- even, if you have skis. And you will find your skis in your ski locker in Hokkaido when you arrive.
Most useful for tourists, you can drop your bags off at a counter in Narita Airport (look for the ABC sign) and find them at your hotel a day (or possibly, two) later anywhere in Japan. It works the other way too, particularly helpful if you are traveling to and from Narita by train. Hotels will readily handle the details. And there's no tipping.
