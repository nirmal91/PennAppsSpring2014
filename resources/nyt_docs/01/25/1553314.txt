I noticed that Maass exclusively used the term ''winning hearts and minds'' instead of the more specific, technical term: pacification. Perhaps this is because pacification doesn't sound politically correct. Bottom line, though, at least it doesn't sound downright cynical in the way that ''hearts and minds'' has pretty much always sounded.
