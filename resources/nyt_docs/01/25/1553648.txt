A giant sculpture that was recently vandalized will return to its previous spot on Main Street in front of the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield next month, an official at the museum said last week.
Richard Klein, the museum's assistant director, said that ''Big Baby,'' a 7-foot-high, Fiberglass representation of an infant clothed in diapers, will be repaired at a Connecticut auto body shop and then be exhibited on Main Street until May. The piece will then be moved to another location at the museum.
''There has been a lot of interest in it,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We also want to show that we are not going to cave into stupid vandalism.''
The Ridgefield Police said that according to a witness, the sculpture was damaged by what appeared to be two young men using a road flare on Jan. 2, a Friday evening. The police said they have leads in the case, but that no arrests had been made.
''Big Baby'' is the work of Nina Levy, who is based in Brooklyn, N.Y. Ms. Levy, who has not yet seen the damage, said the sculpture took about six months to complete and is worth about $25,000.
Mr. Levine said the piece was controversial because some residents don't think it is suitable for the town's historical district.
