VOLUME appeared in unexpected ways at the couture shows in Paris.
Big hair, inspired by the photographs of Norman Parkinson and Richard Avedon, gave a Liz Taylor sense of glamour to Dior and Christian Lacroix. For Dior, the stylist Orlando Pita used fat sponge rolls to amplify the models' hair; some hairdos were even shaped into squares, like flat-screen televisions.
For Jean Paul Gaultier's samurai-inspired show, Odile Gilbert wound extensions into hair, and for other looks piled on tortoise-shell combs. The effect was ethnic but also wildly elegant.
