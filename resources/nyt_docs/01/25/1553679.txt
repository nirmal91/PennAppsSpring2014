Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued a rare public apology yesterday, to the widow of Dr. Robert Atkins for mocking the late diet guru at a Brooklyn firehouse last week.
While digging into a pasta dinner with a group of firefighters -- a no-no under the Atkins plan, which calls for controlling the intake of carbohydrates -- the mayor used profanity to suggest skepticism about the account of Dr. Atkins's death last year -- he slipped and fell on a sidewalk -- and went on to describe him as ''fat.''
Mr. Bloomberg, not realizing that his remarks were being taped by NY1 News, told firefighters that he had attended a fund-raiser at the Atkins's home in the Hamptons, and found the food there to be so inedible that ''I took one appetizer and I had to spit it into my napkin.''
Dr. Atkins's widow, Veronica, appeared on ''Good Morning America'' on Friday to demand a public apology. During an interview taped later that day with ''Eyewitness News Up Close with Diana Williams,'' Mr. Bloomberg said he did not think he had to apologize for a joke. ''I think my answer is lighten up a little bit, and you should watch what you eat,'' he said. But yesterday, the mayor had a change of heart. His apology came in a contrite statement from his press secretary, Ed Skyler.
''While talking to firefighters about the challenges of losing weight, the mayor made a joke which upset Veronica Atkins,'' Mr. Skyler said. ''He never intended to insult her late husband or offend her and is sorry that has been the result.''
His apology included an invitation to the kind of meal that won Dr. Atkins a following. ''To make it up to Mrs. Atkins, the mayor would like to invite her to a steak dinner -- no potatoes,'' Mr. Skyler said. Mrs. Atkins accepted Mr. Bloomberg's invitation for dinner next week, a spokesman, Richard Rothstein, said. ''She is delighted with his apology, and feels that he is being very gracious.''
