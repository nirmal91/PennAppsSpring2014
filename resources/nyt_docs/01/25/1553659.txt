To the Editor:
Re ''Mystery Drama, With the Pope Cast as a Movie Critic'' (Vatican Journal, Jan. 23):
The focus of concern about the historical accuracy of the narrative portrayed in Mel Gibson's film ''The Passion of the Christ'' and whether or not His Holiness actually uttered the words ''It is as it was'' is misguided.
The real question in a world torn apart by conflicts that are more often than not rooted in the religious passions of the various combatants is whether the telling of this version actually helps or harms the world.
For those of us, including Mr. Gibson, with strong commitments to particular spiritual traditions, now is the time to make choices that prove our ability to remain faithful to our understandings of our religious pasts, while helping to create a more peaceful and humane future.
Failing that, we are likely to be left in a world in which one must choose between either a hatemongering religion, or a humanity bereft of spirituality.
