ATLANTIC ISLANDS -- The Azores, islands off the coast of Portugal, are the destination in a one-week package from Azores Express, a Fall River, Mass., tour company. The trip leaves from Boston, and the starting price of $579 a person, double occupancy, includes round-trip air fare, six nights' lodging and all breakfasts. Departures are on Friday and some Tuesdays through April. The base price features the Terra Nostra Garden in Furnas on SÃ£o Miguel. The Terceira Mar Hotel on the island of Terceira brings the price to $729 to $879 a person. Taxes ($80) are extra; flights are on a Sata International A-310. Information: (800) 762-9995 or www.sata.pt.
FAVORABLE EXCHANGE -- If Americans could trade their dollars for British pounds at par value, it would be a good deal, since 1 pound costs about $1.86. The Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments in London has something like it: This year, it is charging the same figure in dollars for its rates as in pounds, for any night. Rates range from $285 for a room to $415 for an apartment to $445 for a studio. Tax, at 17.5 percent, is extra, as is breakfast. The Athenaeum, with 157 units, is at 116 Piccadilly opposite Green Park in Mayfair, near the West End and Buckingham Palace. Ask for the Pound for a Dollar rate; (800) 335-3300 or www.athenaeumhotel.com.
A DROP AT THE LIFTS -- Bretton Woods, the New Hampshire ski area, is celebrating its 30th anniversary next weekend, and as part of that, lift tickets will be $30 on Feb. 1. (The same rate is available only for Feb. 9 and 29 and March 8.) The rate is good for all ages. A typical weekend pass is $59, $48 for ages 13 to 18, and $36 for ages 6 to 12. Information: (603) 278-3320 or www.brettonwoods.com.
MED SAVINGS -- When two people travel together to the Club Med Columbus Isle in the Bahamas, the second person stays free. That breaks down to a total of $1,738 for a couple, including a Club charter flight from New York, for travel Feb. 21 to March 27. The Club membership fee of $55 is extra. Rates include all meals and drinks and most activities. Information: (800) 258-2633 or www.clubmed.com.

TRAVEL ADVISORY  Correction:  February 8, 2004, Sunday  An entry in the Deals and Discounts column on Jan. 25 about the Club Med Columbus Isle in the Bahamas misstated the terms of a $1,738 package for two from New York. The price does not include the air fare for the second person; that is $390 extra.
