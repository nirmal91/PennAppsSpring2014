To the Editor:
Fair Lawn, and any suburban New Jersey town, could be considered Dullsville. We don't have glamorous billboards or Broadway shows in our backyards. I've been through that whole ''NYC = Cool'' phase.
But even though New York may be the Emerald City, most of us, like Dorothy, learn over time to appreciate our home. Tame, static, predictable, simple, quiet, peaceful home.
