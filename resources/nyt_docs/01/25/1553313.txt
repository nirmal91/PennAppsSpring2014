Nagl suggests that Iraqis who do not inform on insurgents might have their neighborhoods shelled by American artillery. His history books must tell him that the Germans used such collective reprisals extensively as a counterinsurgency tactic in France, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in 1940-45. Despite the might of the Nazi Wehrmacht, these tactics failed.
Many who ordered the reprisals later found themselves at Nuremberg, facing justice for their war crimes.
