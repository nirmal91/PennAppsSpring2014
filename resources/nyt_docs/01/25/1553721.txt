To the Sports Editor:
I am disturbed to read that some Brooklynites will have a problem rooting for the Nets. Where does this myth come from, that one must be faithful to the same team one's whole life? It's rare when an athlete does it, so why should I? In 1996, I changed allegiance from the Knicks to the Nets simply because one let me down too many times and the other had a more exciting style of play. Switching teams is no big deal. Let's not take ourselves so seriously.
