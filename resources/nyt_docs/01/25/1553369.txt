To the Editor: I commend you on warning people to be safe when approaching the sport of recreational diving but hope people don't get turned off on a truly wonderful experience. A suggestion is to spend the money and take a certification course including all pool and classwork at a local NAUI or PADI dive shop recommended by others. If you do not want to do your open-water certification dives in cold water, then you can do them at a certified warm-weather resort where there are also other activities. It's well worth the investment if you plan on taking the plunge more than once.
