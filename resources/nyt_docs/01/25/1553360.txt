It's easy to imagine Ernest Hemingway at work on the balcony of the Sun Valley Lodge's Room 206, tapping out the final pages of ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' with the sun beaming in from above the jagged Smoky Mountains. His suite might still have been littered with the detritus of the previous night's party. Hemingway was famous for entertaining celebrity guests of the lodge until all hours during his stay in 1939.
Like the others, Hemingway was lured to Ketchum by the Union Pacific Railway chairman, W. Averell Harriman, who founded the Sun Valley Resort as a way of drumming up winter business for his company.
Today the resort has grown into a minivillage on the western edge of the town of Ketchum. There are 505 lodging units of various sorts, two skating rinks (one indoors, one outdoors) and even a post office.
But Sun Valley is more than a great ski area and resort. Ketchum itself is a charming town, thanks to its isolation. From most United States cities, getting there requires a three-leg flight. And because the local airport can be a difficult place to land, flights are often diverted to Twin Falls, a 90-minute bus ride away.
The isolation spares Ketchum from crowds and day-trippers, which is fine with most local residents. A bigger airport is planned. But for now, getting to Sun Valley can be challenging.
Events
Far from urban street lights, the Galena Lodge Nordic ski center, 24 miles north of Ketchum on Highway 75, (208) 726-4010 or www.galenalodge.com, takes advantage with dinners for moon- and stargazers. For $30, guests are served a five-course dinner with family-style seating in the historic lodge, part of which dates from 1879. Full-Moon Dinners (Feb. 5 and 6 and March 5 and 6) are followed by moonlight skiing. Stargazing Dinners (Feb. 20 and March 20) feature an astronomer's lecture and the opportunity to peer through a telescope.
Ketchum's lovely landscape inspires a lively arts scene. Upward of 30 galleries dot the town, with a heavy concentration on First Avenue. Visitors can tour them on their own or during monthly Gallery Walks, from 6 to 9 p.m. on select Fridays (Feb. 13 and March 12). Information: (208) 726-5512.
The Wells Fargo Boulder Mountain Tour, Feb. 7, is one of the largest cross-country ski races in the nation. It's $85 to race, free to spectators, who watch from multiple vantage points along Idaho 75. About 1,000 racers follow a 32-kilometer course (a little under 20 miles) along the Big Wood River from Galena Lodge to the headquarters of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, just north of town. Elite competitors start first and finish in just over an hour. Nordic neophytes are welcome as well. Information: (208) 788-1550 or bouldermountaintour.com.
If a 32-kilometer race sounds too strenuous, there's the annual Sun Valley Gourmet Ski Tour March 13. It follows a 13-kilometer portion of the same course and the same finish, but participants stop every few miles to sample the food and drink of local restaurants. Entry fee is $60. Tickets sold at Backwoods Mountain Sports Shop, (208) 726-8818.
The final big events of the winter season are the overlapping Bill Janss Pro-Am Classic (March 26 and 27) and SolFest (March 27 and 28), both fund-raisers for the Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation. The Pro-Am is a gathering of big name ski and snowboard athletes for a weekend of racing. SolFest is a youthful event centered on a Sunday big-air exhibition by nationally known pro skiers and riders, followed by a street party at the Warm Springs base area. New this year is a Saturday festival of 1970's works of Warren Miller, the ski-film pioneer. Information: (800) 634-3347.
Sightseeing
Bald Mountain won't disappoint seasoned skiers. ''Baldy'' is known for consistent steeps, prodigious snowmaking and impeccable grooming, which combine for boulevards of perfect corduroy on which speed-loving experts carve long, fast arcs. (Ketchum has produced several skiing Olympians, including medalists Christin Cooper and Picabo Street.) Among the first-rate facilities are three handsome new lodges: one at each base area (River Run at the north end of town and Warm Springs, at the south) and one at the summit of the Seattle Ridge area, with wind-sheltered decks and 360-degree views of the jagged Pioneer and Boulder Ranges. Beginners may find Baldy, with its vertical drop of 3,400 feet, a bit challenging. But the trails at Dollar Mountain, a separate area near the resort, are far gentler. Lift tickets are $66 a day at Bald Mountain, $26 at Dollar. Information: (208) 622-6136; sunvalley.com; snow conditions, (800) 635-4150.
If there's a knock against the skiing at Sun Valley, it's the dearth of natural snowfall (150 to 200 inches a year on average, compared with 300 at Aspen and 350 at Whistler). That's rarely a problem for Sun Valley Heli-Ski Guides, which delivers powder lovers deep into the mountains aboard its five-passenger A-Star. Skiers pay $7 per 100 vertical feet skied, so a typical day of 10,000 vertical (the pilot keeps track of how far and how often you ride back up) costs $700. This year, the company opened a backcountry lodge on the south fork of the Boise River. A two-night, three-day heli-ski package there costs $3,200 a person, meals included; (800) 872-3108, or visit sunvalleyheliski.com.
Cross-country skiers and snowshoers can choose between the 75-mile North Valley Trails system, which meanders through the Big Wood River Valley north of town, or 25 miles of trails on the Sun Valley Resort campus, (208) 622-2250. Galena Lodge, (208) 726-4010, the last remnant of a once-burgeoning mining town, lies at the heart of the North Valley system. Skiers can have lunch near the fireplace. North Valley Trails passes cost $9.54 and are available at several sporting goods stores in Ketchum as well as at the headquarters of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, (208) 727-5013, eight miles north of town on State Route 75. Sun Valley Resort trail passes cost $13. Equipment rentals are available at either Galena Lodge ($20 for skate skis; $15 for classic Nordic skis) or the Sun Valley Nordic Center ($22 and $17).
The Ketchum/Sun Valley Heritage and Ski Museum, 180 First Street East, (208) 726-8118, occupies a complex of former Forest Service buildings. Exhibits cover the area's natural history, Native American culture, early mining and sheep-herding days, Sun Valley's Olympic heritage and general ski history. Free admission.
Huskies do the work at Sun Valley Sled Dog Adventures, (208) 823-4600, www.sunvalleysleddogs.com, about a 20-minute drive southeast of town on East Fork Road. A seven-mile tour through the Pioneer Mountains takes about 90 minutes and costs $100 a person.

WHAT'S DOING IN JOE CUTTS is a senior editor at Ski magazine.
Correction:  February 15, 2004, Sunday  Because of an editing error, the What's Doing column on Jan. 25, about Sun Valley, Idaho, reversed the locations of the River Run and Warm Springs base areas of the Sun Valley ski resort. River Run is at the south end of the town, and Warm Springs at the north end. A map with the column mislabeled the body of water that runs parallel to Warm Springs Road. It is Warm Springs Creek; Big Wood River, unlabeled on the map, runs north and south parallel to Route 75.
