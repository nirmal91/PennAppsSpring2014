An article on Dec. 21 about the musician Chip Taylor misspelled the surname of the lead singer of the Wild Ones, the group for which he wrote the song ''Wild Thing.'' The singer was Jordan Christopher, not Christoper. (The error was detected last week when the article was prepared for transmission to subscribers of The New York Times News Service.)
