Some executives find the future leaders of their organization by hiring headhunters, but Mark Pappas found his right-hand man behind a Starbucks counter.
Seven years ago, when Mr. Pappas, the president of MortgageIT, a national mortgage provider based in New York, was in Boston for a meeting, he stopped at a Starbucks for a latte. His server was Rich Hofbauer, who was barely out of college at the time. The two began talking, and Mr. Hofbauer told Mr. Pappas that he had tried to start a business selling high-end specialized bicycles. Though the business wasn't successful, he was able to give a number of ''brilliantly thoughtful'' reasons as to why it failed, Mr. Pappas said. ''His insights,'' he added, ''were keener than most seasoned businesspeople.''
Then, Mr. Hofbauer told Mr. Pappas that he and his girlfriend wanted to move to New York, and he gave Mr. Pappas his card.
A few months later, Mr. Hofbauer was hired as a sales assistant, and he recently was promoted to director of operations.
''It's amazing how much you can learn about someone over a latte,'' Mr. Pappas said.
