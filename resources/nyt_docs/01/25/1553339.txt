''Tarnation,'' a first feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival (which ends today) is being heralded for its frugal, lets say minuscule, budget. The news release -- yes, even this film has a publicist -- highlights its $218.30 cost. Made by Jonathan Caouette, 31, using home movies, telephone messages, re-enactments and diary entries, the film's about a seriously dysfunctional Texas family. Its budget breaks down like this:
High 8 tapes: $149.46  VHS tapes: 33.57  Angel wings: 25.00  Camera adaptor: 10.27
Total budget: $218.30
FILM  Correction:  February 1, 2004, Sunday  A brief article last Sunday about the $218.30 budget of the film ''Tarnation'' omitted a credit. Andy Bailey contributed reporting.
