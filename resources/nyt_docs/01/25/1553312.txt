Maass's report has further darkened whatever dim hopes I once had for an expeditious end to the occupation of Iraq. Perhaps in some future monograph, Major Nagl will point out the difference between liberation and invasion. Liberators are greeted with ''flowers and sweets'' because they free a country from foreign occupation. Foreign armies that arrive to replace indigenous governments, no matter how repressive those governments may be, will always be perceived as invaders. Inevitably, there will be resentment, resistance and insurgency.
