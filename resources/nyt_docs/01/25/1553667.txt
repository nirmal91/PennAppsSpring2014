To the Editor:
While your Jan. 23 editorial ''The Perils of Online Voting'' (''Making Votes Count'' series) and Paul Krugman's Jan. 23 column, ''Democracy at Risk,'' about electronic voting, are on target, they don't recognize that at some time in the future, electronic voting can probably be made safe, certainly as safe as any system currently in use.
That said, it is necessary to do something today about the vote fraud and irregularities that already affect the voting system. This is an immediate problem that undermines our Republic.
The ease of registering has created vote-fraud problems without a corresponding effort to cleanse voter rolls.
The issue needs to be addressed comprehensively, and not just from the point of view of electronic voting.
