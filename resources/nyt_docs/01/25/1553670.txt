It looks like a campaign tour, it sounds like a campaign tour, it feels like a campaign tour, but Bret Schundler, who sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination the last time around, insists that his 41-day swing through the state's 21 counties over the next three months is not a precursor to a run for governor in 2005.
Call it wanderlust? No, Mr. Schundler insists that the statewide trek that kicked off this month is the latest effort of his ''Empower the People'' campaign, an advocacy group he began when he was mayor of Jersey City. Meeting with local and school officials by day and holding town meetings at night, Mr. Schundler is seeking local support for two state constitutional amendments that would reward local governments that keep spending in check.
Matthew Barnes, the executive director of Empower the People, agreed that his boss was involved in a ''full-blown campaign.'' But Mr. Barnes quickly added that it was ''not political as such.''
Taking a page from someone on the opposite end of the political spectrum -- Howard Dean, a Democratic presidential contender -- Mr. Schundler said he had spent the last year upgrading his organization's technology. The new Internet-driven program he calls ''Web Army Mobilization,'' or WAM, will allow him to tap into vast numbers of volunteers, he said.
''We're making it easy for volunteers,'' he said. ''They can be in their pajamas and pick up the phone to call their legislators.''
Skirting a question about plans to run for office with ''I haven't made any decisions yet,'' Mr. Schundler said he had found it more enjoyable traveling the state pressing his agenda without the partisanship that comes with declaring one's candidacy.
''When I ran for office, I was attacked personally,'' he recounted last week, taking a break during his Morris County kickoff day. ''They were creating a caricature. Every time my name was mentioned it was like you'd hear that 'Jaws' theme.''
