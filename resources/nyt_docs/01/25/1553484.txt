To the Editor:
''The No-Bang, All-Whimper Recovery'' (Market Watch, Jan. 11) looked at why the number of new jobs was not expanding as fast as the overall economy.
Not examined, however, was the notion that many companies, having gone through the long and costly process of downsizing, have a built-in repugnance to adding workers again. Instead, as business improves, they persuade their existing workers to put in more overtime.
That saves the company from rebuilding head count -- something that most companies did recklessly in the freewheeling late 90's, to their later chagrin. Moreover, this policy has an added advantage for companies: they do not have to pay for the benefits packages associated with taking on new workers.
This means that the mountain -- improving the jobs picture -- will be even harder to climb. Meanwhile, those who are already working will reap a windfall while those on unemployment lines will wait that much longer. Is legislation needed to resolve this?
