Re ''Bullies Are Not What Ails Hollywood'' by Frank Rich [Jan. 11]:
Citing an epic production like ''Cold Mountain'' as evidence of Miramax Films' ''big studio mentality'' fails to offer the proper perspective on the company's priorities. Considering that every major studio originally turned down ''Cold Mountain'' (just as they did ''The English Patient,'') and that one of them abandoned it during preproduction, the financial risk and sacrifices associated with the project hardly qualify as joining ''the establishment.'' In many ways ''Cold Mountain'' became so independent, it was almost an orphan.
Mr. Rich acknowledged that Miramax released ''some genuine indie movies'' like ''The Station Agent'' this year. A true evaluation requires considering the entire slate, including Miramax's financing of the Portuguese-language ''City of God'' and Stephen Frears's ''Dirty Pretty Things,'' and its distribution of ''The Barbarian Invasions'' and ''The Magdalene Sisters.''
While Miramax can no longer be best described as ''a renegade operation,'' our co-chairmen remain committed to those projects that no one else will make, to help rescue the art that remains such an important part of our culture.
