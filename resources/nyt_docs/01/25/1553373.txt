To the Editor: I enjoyed ''What's Doing in Houston'' and was sorry that it did not mention Houston Friends of Music, a presenter of chamber music featuring world-class ensembles. These concerts are co-sponsored with the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University, which is only minutes away from the museums, the Warwick Hotel and the new light rail.
One concert scheduled during week of the Super Bowl is the Emerson String Quartet, on Thursday. For information or reservations call: (713) 348-5400.
