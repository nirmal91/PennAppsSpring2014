To the Editor:
Re ''Critics Say the Park Service Is Letting Religion and Politics Affect Its Policies'' (news article, Jan. 18):
In Charlotte, N.C., where I live, churches and homeowners post Christian religious messages for all to see. I'm not offended because it is on their own property.
But the national parks are the property of all citizens, Christians or not. To post Christian religious messages in the national parks, on public property -- that offends me!
