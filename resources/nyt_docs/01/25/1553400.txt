Now that trucker -- caps are fading into fashion's twilight, there is a new breed of ball cap on deck, one that is prettier, feminine and blessedly logo- and mesh-free. The cap, designed to accommodate long hair, wraps around a ponytail and has a Velcro closure and a small opening in the back -- no ponytail elastic required. The hats, called Wrap Caps, come in suede, leather, cashmere, denim and tweed, $129 to $169 at www.wrap-cap.com. (Gwyneth Paltrow owns versions in beige suede and baby-blue cashmere.) Each is lined with a Liberty of London fabric, a paisley, stripe or tie-dye print.
