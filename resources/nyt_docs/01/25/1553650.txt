A box of valuable jet aircraft parts lost off a truck on Interstate 95 in Fairfield County earlier this month has been returned.
Mark P. Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt and Whitney in East Hartford, which had refurbished the titanium engine blades for Korean Airlines, said the box was found by a driver for a food company in New York City shortly after it fell off a truck bound for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Jan. 15.
Mr. Sullivan said the parts, valued at $100,000 and destined for Seoul, South Korea, were undamaged. The box was brought back to Pratt and Whitney on Monday.
The box was part of a consignment of Korean Air parts being shipped by Condor Air Transport of Stratford.
