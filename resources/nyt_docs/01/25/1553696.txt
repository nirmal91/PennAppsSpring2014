THE campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination reaches a crucial stage Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary. Can Howard Dean rebound from his third-place finish in Iowa? Can Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, the first- and second-place finishers in Iowa, stay on a roll? Can Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Gen. Wesley K. Clark gain a foothold?
Here is the current outlook for the five major candidates:
HOWARD DEAN
Strengths: Many New Hampshire voters know Dr. Dean from his near 12-year tenure as governor of neighboring Vermont. He used to have ski races with their governor. His campaign has used grass-roots organizing tactics borrowed from the labor movement, holding some 2,000 house meetings for neighbors to share their stories of support, across the state. He also has the endorsement of the state's largest union, the Service Employees International Union.
Weaknesses: Still reeling from his third-place finish in Iowa -- and the endless replays of his screeching outburst afterward -- a hoarse-voiced Dr. Dean has only a few days to recalibrate his message and reassure voters of his stability.
