The Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, is beginning a two-year term this month as president of the County Executives of America, a Washington-based organization representing elected county officials from 700 counties in the nation.
As president of the 40-year-old group, Mr. Spano will have a national platform from which to lobby for a variety of issues. He said his first order of business will be to lobby the federal government to continue paying a larger share of Medicaid costs, reducing the amount borne by state and county governments.
