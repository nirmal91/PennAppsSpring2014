To the Editor:
Re ''Workers Assail Night Lock-Ins by Wal-Mart'' (front page, Jan. 18):
One night a few years ago, I was working on a computer program for a retail chain store. At 10 o'clock, I started to leave the building, which was busy with people getting the store ready for the next day. ''You can't leave until 6 a.m.,'' I was told. ''The doors are locked, and no one here has the key.''
The person who had the key was called at home and asked to unlock the door, but only after I said I would call the police.
Smart leaders and business people should recognize that the push to cut wages, benefits and human dignity is building up to a social or political explosion. They must ease greatly the pressure working people are under.
Besides, workers with low wages cannot buy goods to support our economy.
