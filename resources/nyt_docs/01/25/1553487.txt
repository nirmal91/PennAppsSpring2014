To the Editor:
When I was 10 years old in 1937, my mother suggested that I start a scrapbook, so I did. All the social events in my life are represented in these books, down to the place cards at dances and weddings.
Now, it's 52 scrapbooks later and I'm 76, looking back on all the pages. All I needed was a scrapbook, scissors, good paste and neatness, with lots of sentimental feelings about my family and friends. It's the cheapest hobby around.
