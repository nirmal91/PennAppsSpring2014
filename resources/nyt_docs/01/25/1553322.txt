Leaving the issue of contributory negligence and other legal arguments aside, if my retriever were to accidentally kill your Yorky, I would be ethically bound to compensate you for the loss of your property (The Ethicist, Jan. 11).
The disposal of the remains is quite another matter. Ultimately, the owners of the Yorky would have to pay for a funeral. The accident forced them to pay for it sooner rather than later.
