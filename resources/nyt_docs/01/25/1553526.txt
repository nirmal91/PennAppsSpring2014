You can buy books on Amazon.com, along with action figures or digital cameras. And now, you can buy into the presidential race as well.
Amazon.com, the online mega-merchant, is taking retail politics to a new level, allowing shoppers to contribute to candidates with a credit card and the click of a mouse.
''We're making it as easy for people to contribute as it is to buy the latest 'Harry Potter,' '' the Web site says.
The candidates are listed in alphabetical order, with biographical information and a policy statement. The law allows contributors to give up to $2,000 to a candidate, but Amazon.com asks that contributions be $5 to $200.
The company is charging the campaigns what it says are the normal fees for transactions and says the money will be donated to Kids Voting USA, a nonpartisan group that provides civics education.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Gen. Wesley K. Clark each had raised about $2,500 on the site as of yesterday, followed by Dr. Howard Dean and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who pulled in about $1,500 apiece. Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio took in $300, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, about $100. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut intends to sign up, a spokesman said.
President Bush, who has raised more than $130 million for his re-election campaign so far, has apparently decided not to participate. Nevertheless, the site has his picture and a link to his campaign's Web site.
