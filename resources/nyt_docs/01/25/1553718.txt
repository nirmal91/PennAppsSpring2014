To the Sports Editor:
In response to George Vecsey's column about Brooklyn (''Dodgers Moved On; Nets Could Move In,'' Jan. 22), I must say there is a distinct disconnect between his perception of what is going on here and the reality of life here. Vecsey's reference to downtown Brooklyn as ''iffy'' is a sad misrepresentation of the area. Brooklyn is an extremely vibrant community that does not need a stadium to provide it with an identity.
It saddens me that the general tone of The Times's coverage of this issue so far has been to talk about how sad Brooklyn is and how a stadium would make us so much better off. If your reporters had more of a keen eye and ear to the pulse of what is really going on in the neighborhood, you would not be such a booster of the real estate grab by Bruce C. Ratner.
We don't need to condemn property to stuff the pockets of a multibillionaire. Ratner hides his real motives of getting richer under the umbrella of the Nets' making Brooklyn a proud place. This is a very clever strategy, but it is not fooling anyone here.
