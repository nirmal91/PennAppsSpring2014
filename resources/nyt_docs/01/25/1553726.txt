To the Sports Editor:
In ''Fox's Familiarity With Eagles Benefits Panthers'' (Jan. 19), the Panthers were referred to as underdogs. Shouldn't it be more politically correct to call the Panthers -- as well as the Lions, the Bengals and the Jaguars -- undercats? Since this could be seen as a slap on the beak, so to speak, of the poor Eagles, Seahawks and Falcons, from now on they should all be referred to as underbirds.
