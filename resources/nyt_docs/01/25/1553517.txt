Armed with spray cans and paint bombs, about 500 antiglobalization protesters clashed with the police in the eastern Swiss town of Landquart on Saturday, as the officers tried to stop them from heading into nearby Davos to protest illegally at the World Economic Forum.
The police said they fired tear gas and pepper spray at the protesters at the Landquart railway station. Four protesters were injured, the police reported; two were given first aid, and two were taken to the hospital.
The railway station and trains were left covered with anticapitalist and antiwar slogans. The police said there had been many cases of criminal damage, including a train so badly vandalized it had to be taken out of service.
The protesters arrived in Landquart by train from Chur, where they had been among about 1,200 people demonstrating earlier in the day, leaving a trail of litter and spray paint -- in the anarchist colors of red and black -- and the window of one bank smashed.
The Swiss authorities banned protests in Davos to prevent disruption to the five-day economic forum, which opened there on Wednesday, but allowed one in Chur, about 45 miles away. Security for the forum was tight, with 4,600 Swiss soldiers and hundreds of Swiss police officers on patrol.
Earlier, 50 to 70 protesters managed to get past police lines and reached Davos.
The police in Davos said they had kept the group ''under control'' and had checked their identities before releasing them. About 30 who refused to give proof of identity were put on a train to Landquart.
