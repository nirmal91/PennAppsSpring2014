To the Editor:
Re ''Democracy at Risk'' (column, Jan. 23):
I don't buy Paul Krugman's argument that paperless electronic voting is a ''threat to the Republic.'' My bank does a pretty good job of counting every cent of my money with computers. My phone company dutifully counts the minutes I use on my cellphone.
In a country where a vote is supposed to be more important than a dollar or cellphone minutes, can't we come up with a sure-fire way to count votes electronically?
Have Americans lost our can-do will? If so, the Republic is gone and we just have not figured it out yet.
