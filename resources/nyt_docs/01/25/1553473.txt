To the Editor:
Urban legends begin with statements like yours about Elizabeth, N.J: ''Just a few minutes from New York, but it feels as if it were on the other side of the country.''
Elizabeth has magnet schools where elementary school students can study Chinese and Russian. It also has a nationally acclaimed yeshiva elementary and high school system known as the Jewish Educational Center. It has excellent Catholic schools and a richly varied population attracted to these schools. It has many Cuban professionals who came after the revolution, along with Portuguese residents who are building up the port neighborhood, and faculty members from Kean University.
I lived for 28 years in Elizabeth, a place that is emblematic of the whole country.
