To the Editor:
Re ''Iraqis Press U.S. for Compromise to Gain Self-Rule'' (front page, Jan. 23):
At the same time that some Iraqis are calling for early elections, it is indeed ironic that the Bush administration is fostering a slower approach involving caucuses and a delay in the transfer of sovereignty, partly because of a lack of security. The security that is needed to ensure a free and fair election in a nation of factions, religious and ethnic, may be difficult to achieve at an early date.
Even in the world's oldest democracy, as was shown in the 2000 election in Florida, the ideal conditions are not always present to obtain a free and fair result.
