If dining out means a favorite chef-prepared meal that you can count on for consistency, the Melting Pot, newly opened in Westwood, is probably not the place for you. Here, you're the chef. You select from an assortment of cheeses, meats, seafood, vegetables and sauces to prepare the dinner you want to have. At a premium price.
The Melting Pot, part of a nationwide chain that is also expected to open in Red Bank later this year, is an upscale fondue dining experience.
The menu selection called Fondue for Two has three courses: a cheese sauce and vegetables and bread for dipping, a specialty salad and a main course. Entrees with names like Continental ($58), Pacific Rim ($60) or Surf and Turf ($78) have combinations of duck, filet mignon, chicken, shrimp and potstickers. Entrees can also be ordered singly, like breast of chicken ($16), vegetarian ($18) or teriyaki sirloin ($18). All include potatoes, broccoli and mushrooms.
Orders require brief cooking in a central pot placed on a magnetic induction heating element set into each table. We tried cooking just enough to eat as we went along and also cooking a bigger batch all at once. Either way, we lost our timing between drinks and the conversation. We were just two; larger groups may need to appoint an official timer.
Dessert is chocolate fondue mixed with nuts, marshmallows or even Bailey's Irish Cream, with fruits, pound cake, brownies and cheesecake for dipping. The small size, at $14, was more than enough for two. Many diners came just for dessert, which meant the restaurant was still crowded when we left at midnight.
