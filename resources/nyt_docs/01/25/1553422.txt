To the Editor:
Re ''Before Cancer Strikes, and After'' (letters, Jan. 18):
The overwhelming majority of the world's cancer control professionals agree that prevention and early detection will save more lives from cancer than any other tool available.
Studies show that about 60 percent of the cancer deaths that will occur in 2004 -- more than 300,000 -- will be related to preventable behaviors like poor nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity and smoking.
Many of the more than one million skin cancers that will be diagnosed could have been prevented. And certain cancers related to infectious diseases, like hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus, could be prevented through behavioral change, vaccines or antibiotics.
Regular cancer screenings can result in detection of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, oral cavity and skin at their earliest, most treatable stages. If all of these cancers were diagnosed at these early stages, their five-year survival rates would increase to an impressive 95 percent.
