To the Editor:
''Peter Grimes'' has always been one of my favorite operas [''Britten and His 'Hero,' Outsiders Both'' by Anne Midgette, Jan. 18]. During a visit to the Aldeburgh Music Festival in 1984, I spent time photographing the area, which is the setting for Britten's opera. Seeing the Moot Hall, the village church (where Britten is buried), and the fishermen bringing in their catch assisted by young boys in hip-waders, made the opera very real.
Perhaps the most striking feature was a few kilometers north, where a marker near the edge of a cliff commemorated the loss of a child who had fallen. The North Sea has been known to erode the cliffs in the area, a fact that could exonerate Grimes in the death of his second apprentice.
