To the Editor:
''Analyze This: Blodget's New Act'' (Jan. 18), about the former analyst Henry Blodget and his emergence as a journalist covering the Martha Stewart trial: One wonders whose trial Ms. Stewart will be covering when her legal travails are over. The possibilities for recycling seem limitless.
