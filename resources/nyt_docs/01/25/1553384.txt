To the Editor:
Kelefa Sanneh cites Bob Dylan as Exhibit A when it comes to playing down vocal virtuosity [''The Sweet Sounds of Really Bad Singing,'' Jan. 18]. But consider Billie Holiday. At the start of her career her style was considered by many to be anything but virtuosic. Yet nearly 50 years after her death, she continues to entrance us. Will this be the case for 50 Cent?
