To the Sports Editor:
I read every article printed in The Times on Thursday concerning Mr. Ratner's plan to bring the Nets to Brooklyn. As small-business owners with a commercial building on the north side of Dean Street, my husband and I are panic-stricken that one developer, with the sweep of his money, power and selfishness, is to use eminent-domain condemnation to take our building and livelihood away from us and many other people in Prospect Heights.
