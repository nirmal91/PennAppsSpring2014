To the Editor:
Readers of your article might think that every suburban high school student who visits New York has Times Square in mind.
Not true. I travel around the city. This lets me see contrast between the cobblestone East River promenade at 86th Street and the fenced-off, weed-strewn walkway in East River Park. Such a view has taught me more about the realities of life than Fair Lawn, N.J., ever could.
And it's invigorating to escape to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or punk concerts on the Lower East Side.
For now, I plan on leaving Times Square to my friends. But we still have one thing in common: the sublime feeling of freedom you get when stepping off the bus at the last stop, Port Authority.
ALEX OSTER  Fair Lawn, N.J.
