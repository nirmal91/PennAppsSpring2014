To the Editor:
Re ''Democracy at Risk,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 23):
It is imperative that we never repeat the frightening scenes from the 2000 election of the taking home of ballots to fill in missing voter information, the scrubbing of voters from voter rolls and so on.
And these scenarios were simply part of the traditional means of voting.
Since so few people vote anyway, why not go back to a paper ballot marked by pencil, pen or marker and then hand-count them all?
Unless there is a paper trail to verify all votes, what the country experienced after the 2000 election will look like a tea party.
