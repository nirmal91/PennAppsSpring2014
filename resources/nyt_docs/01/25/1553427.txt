To the Editor:
Fans of democracy owe Senator John Kerry a note of thanks for his shake-up of the Democratic race (front page, Jan. 21). Why? For the first time in eons, voters in California, the nation's most populous and arguably most important state, may finally have a say come March in selecting a major-party candidate for the presidency.
Barring a close race like the current one, voters in California and other large states are deprived of their right to vote by the one-upmanship scheduling of small-state primaries. This should be high on the list of election practices to reform, right after the statistical distortion created by the Electoral College system.
From 2008 forward, I suggest that California schedule its primary for the same week as New Hampshire's or the Iowa caucuses.
