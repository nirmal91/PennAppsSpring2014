To the Sports Editor:
Brooklyn hasn't waited for the Nets to dream again. For the past 15 years, the borough has grown in leaps and bounds, restoring both an identity and a good quality of life, and this despite obstacles like cuts in the city's budget. It's galling to see that public funds much needed for schools, health care and the arts may go toward helping N.B.A. mercenaries tear apart the fabric of a neighborhood.
Incidentally, downtown Brooklyn already has a world-class institution that draws thousands of happy patrons every year. It's called the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
