Re: ''A Folk Heroine and Her Images of a Quaint World That Never Was,'' (Jan 18).
Benjamin Genocchio describes Grandma Moses's fame as ''like a bedtime story.'' So it is. There have been many movements with a nostalgia for an unreal, earlier day at their core, from the Arts and Crafts movement to the Colonial Revival. Grandma Moses offered an anodyne to a world torn by the Depression and war, and an art world seen by the public as mysterious and even hostile. The wars have not ended; art still baffles many -- hence Grandma Moses's continuing popularity.
But why cover the exhibition at all if it so unworthy? There are other exhibitions that could have been covered in the same space. It is unlikely that the people who wished to see Grandma Moses will be deterred by one negative review.
I was particularly amused by Mr. Genocchio's reference to ''laudatory wall texts.'' What did he expect -- abuse?
