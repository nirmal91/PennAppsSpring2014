Following the craze -- for skin products that contain rare oils and extracts, high-end hair-care brands are whipping up their own outlandish recipes. The label for Phyto's new sell-out curl-enhancing shampoo ($20) and spray ($22, both at sephora.com) lists among the ingredients leaves from the South American mat√© tree. Lavett &amp; Chin puts extracts of hibiscus and neem, a tree native to India, into a hair moisturizing treatment ($26 at Rescue Beauty Lounge, 212-206-6409), while Mario Russo's Once a Day Spray uses extracts from the Asian herb horsetail and green tea ($17.50 at Henri Bendel).
Philip B's Drop Dead Straightening Baume contains horseradish and the essence of the Matricaria flower ($20 at philipb.com). Oscar Blandi combs the ocean floor for his Fango Marine Mud conditioning hair treatment ($23; 212-593-7930 to order). Finally, fans of Fresh's Umbrian Clay products can lather up with the shampoo ($24 at Fresh.com), serene in the knowledge that they are washing with only the finest white clay, from Nocera Umbra, Italy.
