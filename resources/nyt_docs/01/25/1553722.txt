To the Sports Editor:
Absent in all of the coverage of the Nets' potential move to Brooklyn is the financial impact on the fans. I took my son to see a Nets game recently and we spent a tidy $195 by sitting in average-priced seats, drinking $4 sodas, buying a small souvenir and parking the car. I trust that Mr. Ratner will not be giving away seats in his new arena, and I hope that the local fans in Brooklyn are not priced out of the games played in their neighborhood. I don't notice a trend toward lower ticket prices these days.
It's a curious thing that while the Nets were playing average basketball for the last two decades, nobody was rushing to buy them. Now that New Jersey has a marquee team, we lose them in a bidding war. I guess we can take credit for building the team into a contender, and if they falter in Brooklyn, we'll be happy to have them back.
