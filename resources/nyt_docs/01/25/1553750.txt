''Nothing I can tell you will fatten your checking account,'' Brendan Galvin writes in the final poem of this, his 13th book. For him, this is not a shameful confession but an affirmation, and ''Place Keepers'' resonates with his embrace of both the natural world and his own interior one. Wilderness is everywhere in Galvin's poems; few living poets are as memorable in their descriptions of the goings-on in the non-man-manufactured world. In ''Sustenance,'' he writes: ''All night the wind locomotive in the eaves, / and this morning an industrial glassworks / on tree limbs and wires. / . . . it will be barely April for a couple of hours.'' Galvin revels in his ability to find images in moments and objects, and he frequently achieves small transcendences. There are a few times when Galvin piles the words so deep and high that the poems almost break apart from the weight of vocabulary they are asked to bear, and his reflections can occasionally seem like mere ramblings. But Galvin achieves a good deal here. This is a strong collection with a voice that alternately conjures and captures the manifold wonders of the natural world.
