To the Editor:
Re ''The Perils of Online Voting'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Jan. 23):
Online voting is the last, worst voting reform our country needs for a more basic reason than the ''potential for hackers to steal votes or otherwise subvert elections electronically.''
The online voter does not have any guarantee of a secret ballot.
Without the secrecy of the voting booth, no vote can be assumed to be the vote of the registered voter, and no election result can be assumed to be the will of the people.
