Faced with an expected $14 billion state budget shortfall, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has approved hefty fee increases for the state's parks. Beginning July 1, fees in some parks will more than double, though in most cases the increase will be less. The new rates also apply to reservations for visits on or after July 1.
The fees are expected to generate $18 million to offset $15 million in budget cuts and pay for critical maintenance, officials say.
The California parks use a sliding fee system, with higher rates charged in peak season and for more popular parks. Day-use fees at developed parks, now $3 to $5 a vehicle, will rise to $4 to $12. Developed campsites, now $8 to $13, will jump to $11 to $25, plus $10 (up from $4) if the site is considered premium (say, on a beach), or $3 to $9 (currently $3) if there is any kind of hookup.
The fee structure is posted on the department's Web site, www.parks.ca.gov.
It will also cost more to get into the museums and historical sites run by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. For example, visiting Hearst Castle, now $7 to $12, will cost $8 to $25.
California has 277 state parks, with 15,000 campsites, 280 miles of coastline and 3,000 miles of trails. They draw more than 85 million visitors a year, the most of any state park system.
