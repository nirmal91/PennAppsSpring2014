To the Editor:
''Workers Assail Night Lock-Ins by Wal-Mart'' (front page, Jan. 18) read almost as if it had been pulled out of a 19th-century novel about the Industrial Revolution, rather than a 21st-century newspaper. It shocked and embarrassed me to think that such incidents could occur in this great country.
Congress should pass a bill that bans overnight lock-ins of workers. After all, we live in the 21st century, not the 19th. Such situations should never occur in this day and age.
