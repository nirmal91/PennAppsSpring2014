To the Sports Editor:
So, the Patriots and the Panthers were the winners last weekend. Did New England's victory over the Colts and Carolina's victory over the Eagles have anything to do with the strong showings in Iowa by John Kerry (New England) and John Edwards (Carolina)?
Now I'm neither superstitious nor a stargazer, but given that Kerry defeated Edwards by 6 percentage points, I'll take the Carolina Panthers and 7, please.
