After the Enron scandal broke in 2001, Eric Thode, a public relations executive for the company, was left to clean up the publicity mess. But it was nothing compared with the messes Mr. Thode started cleaning up after his position was terminated last month.
The very next day, he started a new company, Craig's Biohazard Solutions. The company, based in Houston, cleans up crime scenes and other sites that have been contaminated. Mr. Thode, a 15-year public relations veteran, said he got the idea for the company from an article about a similar company in U.S. News &amp; World Report.
Mr. Thode's new company is affiliated with his father-in-law's dry cleaning business, Craig's Cleaners, and has already completed four jobs, including cleaning a house where a woman was murdered.
Mr. Thode is the first to say that his career change is a bit dramatic. ''As far as I know,'' he said, ''I'm the only one who has gone from the P.R. business to the death business.''
