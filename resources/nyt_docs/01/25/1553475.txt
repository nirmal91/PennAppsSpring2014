To the Editor:
Re ''The West Side: Mittens On, but No Place to Play'' (Jan. 18): ''Recess'' in the elementary school in the Bronx, where I teach fourth grade, is 10 minutes after lunch, and only when the weather is warm.
I wish our school had a public park for the children to use, one with slides, swings and other luxuries. Instead, our students must play in the staff parking lot.
It's unfortunate that the students at Public School 87 must be confined to an auditorium on the snowiest days, since every child should be able to get fresh air and exercise during the day.
But they should be grateful they even have recess at all, as well as enough textbooks, running water, doors on bathroom stalls, and hooks in the closets where they can hang their mittens and coats. These things, often taken for granted, don't exist in many city public schools.
