A plan to create a park in White Plains is under fire from the Concerned Citizens for Open Space, an advocacy group that has distributed bumper stickers that read: ''A Central Park for White Plains.''
New York Presbyterian Hospital owns more than 200 acres designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, who also designed Central Park. The hospital has floated development proposals in the past that have never come to fruition, but Mayor Joseph M. Delfino has proposed a deal with the hospital that would exchange a rezoning of the property's northern tier to allow for medical commercial development in exchange for 55 acres of parkland that the hospital would lease to the city.
''We're absolutely opposed to this deal, not just because it would add to the city's traffic woes,'' said Barbara Benjamin, chairwoman of the group. ''Under the agreement, the hospital is only going to lease the land and it reserves the right to take it back any time it wants to and any money the public pays to build and maintain the land would be lost. Progress is fine, but this has gotten out of hand.''
The plan is still in the initial phase, said Willa Brody, hospital spokeswoman. ''We're committed to negotiating with the mayor and details are still being worked out,'' she said.
