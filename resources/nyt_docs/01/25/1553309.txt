Males of the global shopping persuasion will find themselves at a crossroads this spring. Never mind the black suits and somber ties of seasons past; a world of color awaits -- flashes of red, paisley, plaid, even orange and turquoise. It has been predicted, at least by those who make their livings knowing such things, that men will want to shop as they have never shopped before, and designers have determined that there are four main roads to go down this season: Preppy, Western, Slim Suits, Pattern and Color. Which is for you? Perhaps all. In a post-metrosexual, free-enterprise system, real men shop for anything as long as it does not necessitate a bikini wax, but maybe that, too. Brave new world this 21st century, isn't it?

Preppy
The elements may be familiar -- bow ties and button-downs -- but the look is anything but. This preppy has continental swagger. And pinko's not a dirty word.
Western
Think of it as the Mild West, where you can mix your metaphors -- i.e., aviator shades and cowboy boots.
Slim Suit
From the shoulder to the ankle, the new suit is narrow. Thin lapels. Skinny ties. And no pleats, please.
Color/Pattern
Are you a solid citizen? Sorry, they're pass√©. It's time to go hippie, with paisleys, florals and the boldest of color choices -- orange.
