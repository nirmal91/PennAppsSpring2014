After struggling for nearly a decade, Florida Splendid China, a theme park in Kissimmee showcasing Chinese art and culture, shut down at the end of the year. Its demise was blamed by park officials on low attendance, which had dropped to fewer than 200 people a day, and a lack of aggressive national advertising.
A spokesman for the 76-acre theme park, Al Riley, said the owner, China Travel Services H.K., an agency of the Chinese government, hoped to find a new owner.
Splendid China was the second theme park in the area to close in 2003, after Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla. Both faced stiff competition from Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, which all reported record crowds -- anywhere from 65,000 to 90,000 in all -- on New Year's Eve, the day Splendid China closed.
The park drew criticism for its ties to the Chinese government. It was picketed a year ago by a local group, Citizens Against Communist Chinese Propaganda, which objected to exhibits from Tibet and other provinces that they asserted were oppressed by the Communist government.
Mr. Riley said there was not a ''direct hands-on relationship'' with the government. The holding company still owns a Days Inn nearby that will remain open.
Besides landscaping that included small ponds and foliage, Splendid China displayed models of famous landmarks in China, including the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. About half of the 40 employees, including the Hebei Acrobatic Group, which performed at the park, were returning to China.
