COLLECTED POEMS
By Paul Auster.
Overlook, $24.95.
Despite all the red flags it raises -- a famous novelist publishing a book of poems, the most recent of which are nearly 25 years old -- this is not the work of a dabbler. Before making his name as a writer of postmodern mysteries, Paul Auster was a poet almost exclusively. He spent his 20's apprenticed to the French Surrealists, the American Objectivists and a handful of hard-to-classify poets like William Bronk, perhaps the most conspicuous influence here. ''Collected Poems'' is dominated by sequences of short, dense lyric meditations on the nature of reality and our inability to apprehend or describe it: ''everything / has changed in us, if we speak / of the world / it is only to leave the world / unsaid.'' But Auster rarely achieves Bronk's clarity or control. Translations of several French poets -- René Char, André Breton -- feel right at home, not because Auster makes English seem like their natural idiom but because his own poems so often read like French Surrealism in translation: ''Along with your ashes, the barely / written ones, obliterating / the ode, the incited roots, the alien / eye -- with imbecilic hands, they dragged you / into the city.'' Here Auster seems reluctant to make any phrase syntactically subordinate to another. Does ''ones'' refer back to ''your ashes'' or forward to ''they''? What's doing the ''obliterating''? Hard-core admirers of Auster, or of his poetic models, might also admire this sort of terminal indeterminacy. Others will prefer the more involving mysteries of his prose.
