The acute angle on a corner of the lot on Upper Broadway on which a 20-story condo is rising dictated a form that has its designers reaching for a word not often heard in architects' offices: a prow.
''That prow has become the major focus of the site,'' said Randolph Gerner, a principal at Gerner Kronick &amp; Valcarcel, the project architect, who said a prow came to mind after he sized up the angle (64 degrees 8 seconds) formed by the southeast corner at Broadway and 107th Street.
The $56 million condominium on the former site of the Olympia movie theater is to have 64 apartments and retail space. Foundation work on the building, to be called the Opus, is under way, with completion set for January. A sales office -- already opened a block north -- has six contracts out.
Apartments leading to balconies with glass balustrades overlooking Straus Park are priced at $1.455 million to $2.9 million. Two-bedroom units of 1,219 square feet are $850,000 to $1.1 million; 1,800-square-foot three-bedrooms are up to $1.7 million.
The developers oriented the Opus ''as a family building and took inspiration from the classic six and seven with flexible rooms,'' said Veronica W. Hackett, co-founder of the Clarett Group, which is jointly developing the site with Prudential Real Estate Investors.
At the third level, a 40-inch-high bronze frieze by the sculptor Ed McGowin will have abstract figures symbolic of Upper West Siders in the arts, as well as a clock.
