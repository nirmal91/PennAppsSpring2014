Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano has submitted legislation to the county Board of Legislators that would make it illegal to sell bottled water with nicotine additives to minors in Westchester. The proposed law also requires merchants to take steps preventing minors from buying it, like they must do with the sale of cigarettes.
''Nicotine is a tremendously addictive drug,'' Mr. Spano said on Wednesday. ''We want to make sure that this product stays out of the hands of teenagers.''
Although labels on the water bottles caution against selling the product to anyone under 18, there are no penalties for doing so.
Nico, as the product is called, is marketed as a product that relieves ''the symptoms of nicotine craving'' and serves as ''a refreshing break to the smoking habit.''
If adopted by the board, the law would ban the sale of Nico to those under 18 and require that the product be under lock and key or placed behind a counter. Violators would face a penalty of $150 per violation after two warnings.
