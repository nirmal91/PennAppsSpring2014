To the Editor:
If Parisians can have kiosks, why can't New Yorkers have news boxes? They add color, character and a public benefit to the streets and pose no more safety risk than trash cans.
The Council bill potentially imposes severe costs on news rack owners, makes it difficult for them to appeal fines and takes away a means for them to distribute free publications. I doubt that many New Yorkers would agree to have their access to free papers taken away. The Council measure should be repealed.
