On Long Island, one gets used to the obnoxious behavior of those who think their ''rights'' trump those of the majority of us who value peace and civility. That's why it was great to see a crackdown on illegal A.T.V. use on environmentally sensitive lands [''Outlaws Ride the Range on Four Wheels,'' Jan. 4]. A few points come to mind:
Penalties for illegal A.T.V. operation should be stiffened so they hit hard enough to curtail the further destruction of sensitive lands.
Police officers caught breaking the law by riding A.T.V.'s in this manner should be dealt with harshly by their respective departments.
We should encourage the extension of this level of enforcement to a similar scourge, the Jet Ski.
