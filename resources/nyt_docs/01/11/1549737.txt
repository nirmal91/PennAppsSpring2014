To the Editor: In his article about an Elderhostel trip to Las Vegas, ''A Disbeliever on the Strip'' (Dec. 28), Alan S. Oser complained about a large gentleman hogging space at a blackjack table. He complained sanctimoniously that he, himself, didn't like to gamble, and he spent $200 skipping classes to fly to the Grand Canyon. He complained about front-row seats at a show, and complained about losing 25 cents in a slot machine.
Mr. Oser trudged and tramped, stared blankly at garish imitations, and skipped many lectures.
I've seen a few guys like him on some of my 35 Elderhostel trips. I wished they had stayed at home instead of ruining my pleasure in learning something new.
