To the Editor:
As the author of the book for ''West Side Story,'' I am bewildered by your review of James McCourt's ''Queer Street'' (Dec. 14). Maureen N. McLane quotes McCourt as saying ''West Side Story'' is ''the supreme encoded queer Broadway musical'' and comments, ''I feel pretty, indeed.'' I have no idea why McLane feels pretty and even less what is encoded in the play.
