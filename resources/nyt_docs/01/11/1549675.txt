Roberto Bolano's novel BY NIGHT IN CHILE (New Directions, paper, $13.95) relates -- in one long, masterfully sinuous paragraph punctuated by a one-sentence finale -- the deathbed memories of the Rev. Sebasti√°n Urrutia Lacroix, a literary critic and Jesuit priest. We learn of his mentoring by a right-wing critic at whose estate Father Urrutia encounters Pablo Neruda; his trip to Europe to visit churches whose priests are more interested in falconry than religious practice; his being called on to give lessons in Marxism to the leaders of Chile's military regime, General Pinochet among them. Pinochet is shown indulging in petty one-upmanship, comparing himself to the leaders of the recently overthrown government. (''I'm always reading and writing. All the time. Which is more than you could say for Allende or Frei or Alessandri, isn't it?'') Father Urrutia's final recollection is of Pinochet-era literary gatherings at the home of a local writer and her American husband (transparently based on the former ambassador Orlando Letelier's assassin and the assassin's wife), in whose basement the regime tortures dissidents. Postwar Chilean politics and literature infuse this densely learned, richly evocative novel. In Chris Andrews's lucid translation, Bolano's febrile narrative tack and occasional surreal touches bring to mind the classics of Latin American magic realism; his cerebral protagonist and nonfiction borrowings are reminiscent of Thomas Bernhard and W. G. Sebald. The novel, Bolano's first to be translated into English, is at once occasion for celebration and for mourning. The author, a native of Chile, died of liver failure in July at 50. Of some consolation is a substantial body of work still to be translated.
