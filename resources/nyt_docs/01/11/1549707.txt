1. The photomural of the Grand Trianon at Versailles adds drama and depth to the small apartment. Duggal will make a digital enlargement of your favorite scene for between $12 and $15 per square foot, not including a $150 charge for the digital scan and $100 for a proof; (646) 638-7070.
2. The living room's vintage tub chairs evoke the 1960's glamour of a Palm Springs living room. McKay salvaged them from the storage room at Henri Bendel, where he worked as the art director in the late 1970's, and had them upholstered in black and white leather. Greenbaum Interiors will replicate McKay's chairs for $2,650, not including fabric; www.greenbauminteriors.com.
3. McKay found the dining room's decorative wall brackets at a suburban mall and painted them himself. Exposures offers a simple but stylish bracket in white, as well as two wood finishes; $29 at exposuresonline .com.
4. The Ming entertainment unit from Milling Road captures the spirit of the antique red lacquer Chinese cabinet in McKay and D'Arminio's apartment -- but this armoire can accommodate a plasma screen television, too; $3,696 at Baker Furniture, 129 Hudson Street.
