To the Editor: Regarding Brian Service's question about hiking in Sicily (Q&amp;A, Dec. 28), I'd like to add a recommendation about a walking tour in Sicily.
Caroline and Pino Nobile, a couple who operate Caspin Journeys, (39-0575) 614-356, www.caspin.com, run regular tours to Sicily, which my wife and I have taken twice. They will customize tours to suit individual groups of travelers. Caroline is English, and Pino is Italian. Both speak English and Italian fluently. In addition, Pino's father is from Sicily and much of his extended family still lives there. So their knowledge of Sicily and its special language, along with their sense of place is deep and current. Their organized 10-day tour costs $3,100 a person.
