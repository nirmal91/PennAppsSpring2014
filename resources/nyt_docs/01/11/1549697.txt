Thank you for ennobling the life of Dorothy Farnan (Arthur Lubow) by featuring her on your cover. She was my English teacher at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx (class of '65). With an open book in one hand, the other clutched to her chest, she recited work from memory.
A slender woman given to frilly collars, accentuated by a generous application of face powder, she seemed prim and modest to us. We had no inkling that she led a bohemian life after 3 o'clock. Now, having read of her adventures with W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, I have become aquainted with the other Dorothy Farnan. I liked them both.
