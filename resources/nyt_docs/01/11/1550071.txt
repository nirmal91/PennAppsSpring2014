Sidewalks and curbing [''Uneven Pavement,'' Jan. 4] are necessary in places of vehicle and pedestrian congestion like along major roads and in shopping areas. But many of us see our communities as havens from the encroaching city and opt for the park-like setting of lawns extending down to a quiet neighborhood street that can be safely shared by children, adults and local traffic. Defining the distance between these two extremes is the job for a community master plan. We all need to think long and hard about changing any element of a neighborhood if we wish to maintain the charm, beauty and quality of life in our communities.
