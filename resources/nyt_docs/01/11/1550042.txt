To the Editor:
Rabbi Gerald L. Zelizer has a narrow vision (''Gay Marriage: A Compromise,'' Soapbox, Jan. 4) that does not include me or my experience, representative of many, many gay and lesbian people and couples. His proposal that homosexuals compromise core values for civil rights is ludicrous, offensive and scary coming from a man of the cloth. If inclusion and equality can cause a ''cultural meltdown,'' then such a meltdown is in order. However, his view of our culture is one seen through fear, not faith.
Not far from Rabbi Zelizer's very own Metuchen congregation is the Church of the Redeemer in Morristown, where I met my partner and where we intend to marry in Spring 2005. This thriving Episcopalian church, highly regarded in the community at large and within the Episcopal community, respects every one of its hundreds of members, the majority of whom are not heterosexual. I can only believe that gay marriage will become -- indeed, is becoming -- a ''normative religious sanctification.'' Why would I even consider otherwise? Isn't this what faith is all about?
