To the Editor: Without question, the most relaxing vacation I ever took was to the North Shore of Kauai, and I enjoyed reliving it through ''A Cottage of One's Own in Kauai'' (Dec. 28) by Daisann McLane.
I'd like to suggest one other outstanding company that rents cottages very reasonably, including many at Anini Beach, one of Kauai's best spots. They also have rentals elsewhere on Kauai and also on the Big Island of Hawaii. I found Anini Aloha Properties, (800) 246-5382 or www.aninialoha.com, to be efficient and reliable.
