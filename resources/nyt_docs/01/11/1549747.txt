Air travelers can now determine not only whether their airline or airport has a track record of delays, but also what causes those delays. The federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics recently introduced a feature on its Web site, www.bts.gov, allowing users to peruse the causes of delays.
The feature is available from the link for Airline On-Time Performance and Causes of Flight Delays, below the Airline Information heading. There, visitors are brought to a page showing monthly statistics for airline delays, and links for data for 17 major airlines and the nation's 31 busiest airports.
Visitors may click on the All Airlines link for the month of October, for instance, then choose Table Version to see a side-by-side comparison of airlines and the reasons for arrival delays. (Departure delays are not covered.) On the main page, under Airline On-Time Statistics, users can type a flight number into a search box, and retrieve statistics about that flight, including the percentage of delayed arrivals and the average length of the delays.
The data, which have been compiled since June, can let prospective fliers weigh the extent to which delays were from weather or circumstances within the carriers' control. They can also see which major airports are most plagued by delays.
''But it's important to remember to look at the long-term trends,'' said David Smallen, a spokesman for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. He suggests scanning through a few months' data to get a fuller picture.
