SERIOUS GIRLS
By Maxine Swann.
Picador, $23.
''Something happens, and you forget to be afraid,'' Maxine Swann writes in her first novel, ''Serious Girls.'' For the 16-year-old Maya -- an outsider at the boarding school near New York City where her wealthy grandmother has dispatched her -- that something is meeting Roe, the other ''serious'' girl in her class. A Southerner on scholarship, Roe shares Maya's passion for books, her curiosity about sex and -- most thrillingly -- her amorphous concerns about the future. On some afternoons, the new friends discuss thrift-store fashion; on others, ''we worry that we don't have a core.'' In descriptions of the girls' relationship, Swann's present-tense, first-person-plural form conveys Maya and Roe's intense attachment to each other, their determination to explore that ''flowering feeling'' of late adolescence together. ''What makes a person a person?'' Roe wonders aloud. To find out, the girls forge permission slips and spend illicit Saturdays in Manhattan. As the outside world intrudes on these jaunts, the girls drift apart, and this exquisitely written novel loses its conviction. Maya takes up with a 32-year-old art critic, Roe with a local dead-ender. From there, the improbabilities heap up, smudging the careful impressionism of the book's opening pages. ''Serious Girls'' confronts the complex torments of adolescent loneliness and unbelonging, the impatience for ''life'' to begin and the ill-defined yearnings that ensue. But for all its elegiac prose and vivid recollection, Swann's novel ultimately enacts the same uncomfortable conclusion as ''Sex and the City'' brunch dates: that even ''serious'' girls require men to become fully human.
