The year is beginning with signs of economic recovery, but when the new state Legislature convenes this month it will confront a budget season that officials say will be the most desperate in years.
For the 2005 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, the state faces a shortfall that could amount to one-fifth of the total budget. And the last two budgets, patched together with elaborate effort to avoid increases in the sales or income taxes, exhausted obvious one-time fixes.
''Of the four budgets we've done, this is the toughest,'' the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, said. ''A lot of easy solutions have been taken. We've cut the budget three years in a row, so the fourth year for the same reason gets a lot harder.'' An analysis by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services said the gap could reach $5 billion.
Mr. McCormac said the current fiscal year should bring an end to a two-year decline in receipts from the three major taxes -- personal income, corporate income and sales tax -- that together account for two-thirds of state revenue. But much of the revenue that closed the budget gap this year and last has been exhausted. This year's $24 billion budget relied on the last money, $1.3 billion, the state could borrow against future receipts from the national tobacco settlement, and on more than $500 million allotted the state in a federal aid package that is unlikely to be renewed. ''Given the loss of those sources,'' Mr. McCormac said, ''even if we had a billion in growth we'd still be a billion short.''
