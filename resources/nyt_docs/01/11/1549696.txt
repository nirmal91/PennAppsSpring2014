Ah, Landrum Shettles (Robin Marantz Henig). Now there was a man who was a thorn in my side for, thankfully, only a few years. I was the head nurse of the birthing center at the ''small hospital in Vermont'' where he ended up after being tossed out of Columbia-Presbyterian, and he kept me and my nurses on our toes by his increasingly bizarre behavior. He was a man torn apart by a dream unfulfilled, a story he told us again and again, as if in its telling the tale would have a different ending. R.I.P., Dr. Shettles.
