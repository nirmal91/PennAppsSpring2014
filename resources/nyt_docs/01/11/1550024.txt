Governor McGreevey announced new regulations last week on storm-water runoff that environmentalists said would create one of the strongest impediments to urban sprawl anywhere in the nation. The regulations, which will prohibit most new construction within 300 feet of rivers, streams and reservoirs, are intended to reduce flooding and protect and improve the state's drinking water supply.
The 300-foot buffer could prevent development of as much as 300,000 acres in the state along an estimated 6,000 miles of rivers and streams. Builders opposed the rules, saying that the state's efforts to restrict growth would lead to higher housing prices and cost 14,000 jobs.
Richard S. Van Osten of the Builders League of South Jersey said that by taking land out of development, the state is shrinking the housing supply for the one million new residents expected in the next 10 to 20 years. ''Where are they going to live?'' he said. ''Clearly, by taking out more ground from development, you increase the cost of housing. The average worker isn't going to be able to afford to live in New Jersey.''
