The University of Connecticut's Center for Land Use Education and Research rolled out a series of satellite maps last Sunday that show the land development in the state over much of the last two decades.
The maps were put together over the last two years using computer software and three photographs taken in five-year intervals between 1985 and 1995, as well as a fourth shot in 2002, from the NASA craft called Landsat. The Landsat orbits more than 400 miles above the state once every two weeks.
''They tended to show us what we already knew: that development has taken place along the coast and the I-95 and I-91 corridors,'' said Sandy Prisloe, a geospatial educator at UConn. ''But in Fairfield County, where the coast had already been pretty much developed by 1985, we saw a lot of development in what you might call the second-tier communities, ones that aren't on Long Island Sound, but are a town or two north.''
Mr. Prisloe said the maps indicate a 16 percent increase in development between 1985 and 2002 and that most of the loss of open area came from the state's forests.
Donald S. Strait, executive director of Connecticut Fund for the Environment, said the maps quantify what environmentalists have been saying for years.
''We are losing our forests at a fast rate,'' he said. ''And we need to work very hard to save the best of what's left.''
The maps and the data represented by them can be viewed the Web at www.clear.uconn.edu, using the link to ''Connecticut's Changing Landscape.''
