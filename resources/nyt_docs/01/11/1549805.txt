To the Editor:
Re ''Across Rural America, Drug Casts a Grim Shadow'' (news article, Jan. 4): While it may be true that methamphetamine, better known as crystal meth, is proving to be a scourge on lower-income rural America, it should also be noted that it is wreaking a bit of havoc in certain affluent urban communities as well. Crystal is readily available and used frequently by well-heeled partygoers across the world.
It could be argued that the crystal meth epidemic is the manifestation of those people, regardless of income or location, who are seeking more effective drug experiences, even though this particular experience is quite destructive. This new epidemic, like the crack scourge in the 80's, is a symptom of deeper-lying social issues and problems.
