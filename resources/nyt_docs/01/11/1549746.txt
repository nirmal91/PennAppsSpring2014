The Gold Line, a new 13.5-mile light-rail line linking Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena in about 36 minutes, appeared to come into its own on New Year's Day, when it was thronged with visitors to the 115th annual Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl game.
The line got off to a good start after its opening July 26, but then a strike of Amalgamated Transit Union workers stopped the train from Oct. 14 to Nov. 17.
According to Gayle Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, this year's Tournament of Roses was the first in a half century that revelers could go to by rail, and the trains were packed not only with parade viewers but also with unexpected numbers of football fans riding to and from the game. The agency's early estimate of Gold Line ridership that day was about 45,000, compared with 14,000 on most weekdays.
With six stations in Pasadena, one in South Pasadena and six in Los Angeles, the new Gold Line expands the Metro Rail system to more than 73 miles, linking it to two existing light-rail lines (Blue and Green) and a subway (Red) that crisscross Los Angeles County.
The regular fare for the rail lines is $1.25, with multitrip discounts, including a $3 day pass, available. The rail lines operate on the honor system, with inspectors spot-checking for tickets.
Trains run every 10 to 12 minutes much of the day and every 20 minutes late, till 2 a.m. Details: www.metro.net or (213) 626-4455.
