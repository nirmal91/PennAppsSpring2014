To the Editor:
Voluntary compliance is the key to avoiding fines for breaking any law. So it's no surprise that news rack owners who have corrected problems involving maintenance and aesthetics have incurred fewer fines than publishers who ignore the law.
New Yorkers' outrage at the proliferation of unsightly and dangerously placed newsracks is precisely why Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz introduced the law. High standards for cleanliness and civility are exactly what we want. If news rack owners want to avoid fines, they must make a conscientious effort to make their boxes comply with the law.
