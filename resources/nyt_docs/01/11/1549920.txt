An article last Sunday about John Snyder and his company, Artists House, which produces educational CD's about the music business, misspelled the surname of a co-founder of A&amp;M Records. He is Herb Alpert, not Albert.
The article also misstated Mr. Alpert's relationship with A&amp;M. He is not the president; he was a co-chairman until 1990, when the business was sold.
The article also misstated the Web address for Artists House. It is www.artistshousemusic.com.
