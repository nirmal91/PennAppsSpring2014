The United States District Court in New Jersey began posting court cases on its Web site on Monday, joining 33 other district courts and 68 bankruptcy courts that already take advantage of e-filing. Files in criminal matters will be open only to the United States Attorney's office and defense lawyers, but most civil cases will be open to everyone, including the public. ''The clerk's office, for all intents and purposes, will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so lawyers can file from the office, hotel room, home or anywhere they have Internet access,'' said James P. Murphy, the court's chief deputy clerk. To access the site, pacer.njd.uscourts.gov, applicants must register with the court clerk's office in Newark, Trenton or Camden.
