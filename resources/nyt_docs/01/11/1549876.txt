To the Editor:
The social milieu swirling around WBAI-FM contains at its most active center hundreds of very constructive people of good will. It's participatory, nonprofessional politics, unfortunately making the discussions fertile ground for taking quotes out of context.
And yes, among 71 board candidates we may have a few divisive individuals. The racially divisive and dubious quote about people ''opposed to the broad communities of color having the right to share power at WBAI'' should have been presented in the context of easily verifiable facts about the rich ethnic diversity of WBAI's programming, staff and management, which nobody is seeking to roll back.
The past decade's biggest radio story has been the concentration of control into fewer and fewer hands. But happily, at all five non-profit Pacifica stations, the trend is going in the opposite direction, via these local board elections in which all listener-supporters can vote.
