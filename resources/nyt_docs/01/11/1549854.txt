If you're looking for tips on cooking beef brisket, pot roast or T-bone steak, skip beef.com. Last week, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals took control of the domain name and put up Web pages urging consumers to become vegetarians.
''This has been something that's been in our sights for quite some time, and with the mad cow disease, it seemed like the perfect time,'' said Bruce Friedrich, a spokesman for PETA.
But PETA, which also controls meatstinks.com and goveg.com, is operating on borrowed time. Michael Fischer, an Internet entrepreneur who says he is sympathetic to vegetarian issues, has lent beef.com to PETA for a month. After that, the domain name will go to the highest bidder, which is not likely to be PETA. The group, officials said, has never paid more than $15 a year for a Web site. The asking price for beef.com is $250,000, Mr. Fischer said.
''Ideally, I would like to see some pro-vegetarian entity purchase it,'' said Mr. Fischer, who also owns tobacco.com. ''But, my working with PETA is basically to help their pro-vegetarian cause and raise the market value of what I consider to be a great piece of real estate on the Internet.''
