To the Editor: I, too, went to Las Vegas in November 2003, as part of an Elderhostel program, under the auspices of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.
Our group of 27 stayed at the Stardust and had wonderful breakfasts and dinners there every day, with extravagant buffet lunches at appealing locations. We toured backstage at ''Jubilee,'' heard fascinating and funny lectures on local history and gaming, attended a magic show and met with the magician privately, and we all gawked at the glittering collections at the Liberace museum.
We were given our own dealers in a private area of a casino, and no one was a novice when we left.
We roared at a tape of crooks and foils, caught by surveillance cameras. Even the college's library was an amazing display of today's technology. Losing at gambling? Who had time?
