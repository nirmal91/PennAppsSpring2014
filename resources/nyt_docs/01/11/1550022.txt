Amid fears that express bus service between Westchester County and Manhattan will be cut because of financing issues, a private bus company stepped forward last week saying they would continue the service if the county calls it quits.
Still, the future of the route remains uncertain. Officials with Service Bus Company, which is based in Yonkers, have said the company will need to receive state transportation operating assistance money to subsidize the route at its current level. County officials said they would oppose such a move as it would reduce the county's portion of the subsidy, which is needed to finance remaining bus service.
Sal DiPaolo, vice president of Service Bus Company, said that if the subsidy was not made available they would simply reduce midday service, which is light.
Concerned citizens have called a public meeting for 7 p.m. on Jan. 29, at the Yonkers Public Library to discuss strategies to save the service.
''I want the service to continue as is,'' said Supervisor Paul J. Feiner of Greenburgh, who helped get the service started in 1982. ''During the blackout the buses were a lifesaver. Certainly having more ways of getting out of the city in these terrorist-related times is really important.''
