In fur, the style is all in how you wear it, whether cinched at the waist with a leather belt to trap the body heat or worn with a wide collar or hood to warm the head. Then there are the supple furs, knitted or sheared, furs that have collars with space enough for cuddling dogs, and jackets for the nonchalant look.
