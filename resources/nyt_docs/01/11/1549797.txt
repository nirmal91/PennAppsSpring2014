To the Editor:
Re ''First-Class Screenings'' (letter, Jan. 5):
While the special lines for first-class and elite-status fliers at many airports grant quicker access to the Transportation Security Administration's inspection stations, the lines are maintained by the airports and/or airlines, not the security agency.
In short, contrary to the letter writer's assumption, they represent no dilution of the security agency's resources.
