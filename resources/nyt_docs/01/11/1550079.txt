NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  Green Bay Packers (11-6) at Philadelphia Eagles (12-4)  4:45 p.m., Fox
Quarterbacks Brett Favre and Donovan McNabb are the class of the National Football Conference. They are leaders with immense talent but also fun-loving jokesters off the field. They are two players you can't help but root for, two quarterbacks you can't take your eyes off of.
Favre continues to lead the Packers just weeks after the death of his father, Irvin, on Dec. 21 near Kiln, Miss. Favre's play has been focused and precise, as has the play of the entire Packers' team.
For all of Favre's brilliance, though, he occasionally forces throws in the postseason, looking for the big play and, instead, finding the wrong jersey.
The throws that Favre got away with against the young, aggressive Seattle Seahawks secondary in Green Bay's overtime victory in the wild-card playoff game might be snagged by the Eagles' defensive backs if Favre is not careful. When the Eagles and Packers met in a Monday night game on Nov. 10 in Green Bay, Philadelphia sacked Favre four times and caused six fumbles on the way to a 17-14 victory at Lambeau Field (Favre played despite a thumb injury). Expect the Packers to keep the ball in the hands of running back Ahman Green even more.
Conversely, the Eagles need McNabb to make plays, especially with running back Brian Westbrook out for the postseason after surgery for a torn triceps.
McNabb has played through his own thumb injury and the perception that he is overrated. He has responded by marching the Eagles into prime position for a run to the Super Bowl.
