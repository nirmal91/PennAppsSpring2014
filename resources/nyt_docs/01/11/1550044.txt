To the Editor:
Re ''Gay Marriage: A Compromise'' and ''And an Amendment to Protect My Marriage'' (Soapbox, Jan. 4):
When one considers the current divorce rate, the only real threat to the "sanctity" of marriage would seem to be heterosexuals themselves. As for those on the religious "right," perhaps they have conveniently forgotten one of Jesus' fundamental tenets: It's not whom you love, it's that you love.
One can only hope that in the very near future both the state and the church will come to this enlightened and compassionate conclusion.
