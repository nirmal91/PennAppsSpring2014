For the past few days a dome of arctic air has been sliding toward the East Coast, and now it's settled over us. ''Dome'' has a pleasant sound, as if we had all been trapped in a snow globe and were just waiting for someone to come along and shake a blizzard down around us. And a cold snap like this does bring some pleasantness with it. The snow, where snow still lies on the ground, acquires a fine particularity. Days this cold are almost invariably sunny, and yet even in a clear sky the sun seems to shine through a delicate haze. North of New York City the temperatures reached well below zero the last two nights. A winter without a couple of nights like that wouldn't feel quite like winter. It's a perfect occasion for canceling everything that can be canceled.
And yet it is easy to underestimate the sternness of such cold. In temperatures like these, bare metal acquires a kind of savagery, ready to bite anything the least bit wet. Cars start reluctantly, and even the simplest errands require some forethought, because the possibility of being stranded in the cold is forbidding. Suddenly ''exposure'' seems like something you could really die from, and not just a term of art. Even a short walk outdoors is enough to remind you what aqueous creatures we are. The moment you step outside, your nostrils begin to freeze, and you realize that your body is somehow merging, on its own, with the elements. The mildest breeze is an assault on the senses.
Cold as it has been at night, the moon makes it seem colder yet, especially where there is still some snow cover. Looking out at the pallor of that frozen landscape, you can't help imagining that the moon is exuding the cold, glazing us over with its light. That's when the idea of a dome of arctic air seems most useful. The moon will go down, the sun will rise, and this gelid atmosphere will slide away, having validated the seriousness of winter once again.
