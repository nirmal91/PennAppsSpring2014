In the 19th century, Melbourne was called the Manchester of the South. Now the multicultural city is more like a Milan beyond Europe, the art and design capital of Australia,with a vigorous cultural life, imaginative and prolific in architecture, theater, music and the visual arts. It also offers plenty of good food, sporting events and cafe life.
Built on the fabulous spoils of the Victorian gold fields and reinforced by pastoral wealth, Melbourne grew to maturity through manufacturing. The city of 3.5 million is now principally structured around service industries, education and research. Once voted the world's most livable city, it has one of the largest populations of foreign students in the world.
Melbourne is in every sense more low key than Sydney, its flamboyant subtropical rival in New South Wales. Spread out around the generous beaches of Port Phillip Bay and the Yarra River, Melbourne is topographically gentle and somewhat flat, laid out in grids. It is a serious town, softened by sumptuous gardens and Victorian buildings.
With one of the largest tramway networks in the world (150 miles of track cross the town and lead to the leafy suburbs), you can get almost anywhere in Melbourne by tram. The trams, some of them antique, augment a yet-more-extensive railway, and there is a bus network, too. A $4.15 ticket, at $1.40 Australian to the U.S. dollar, affords unlimited travel on the three systems for a day; a weekly ticket is $18. City Circle trams are free.
The redevelopment of the National Gallery of Victoria is an example of Melbourne's energetic cultural atmosphere. When the impressive collection of old masters and contemporary art outgrew its site on St. Kilda Road, two city towers were demolished to make way for a new complex by the Yarra. The result, Federation Square, which opened in November 2002, has attracted two million visitors.

Sightseeing
The National Gallery of Victoria, International, (61-3) 8620 2222, www.ngv.vic.gov.au, recently reopened after renovation. Its holdings are formidable, from ancient Greek sculpture to masterworks by such artists as Poussin, Rembrandt, Tiepolo, Monet and Bonnard. The international collection, which includes a Caravaggio blockbuster March 11 to May 30, is housed on St. Kilda Road (No. 180). Australian art is in the Ian Potter Center at Federation Square, a spectacular new building designed by a local firm, Lab Architecture. The organically spreading weave of shapes on the exterior reflects the figure-eight layout of the rooms. Entry is free; some special exhibitions, like the Caravaggio show, have admission fees.
The Melbourne Museum, (61-3) 8341 7777, www.melbourne.museum.vic.gov.au, is in a fine postmodern building designed by Denton Corker Marshall, a local firm, in the beautiful Carlton Gardens. Like the National Gallery, it contains abundant material on Aboriginal culture as well as history and the sciences. Until March 8, ''Design in Italy 1945-2000'' features 100 objects from the permanent collection of the Triennale di Milano, including Moreno Ferrari's raincoat that becomes a chair.
The seductively landscaped Royal Botanic Gardens, (61-3) 9252 2300, www.rbg.vic.gov.au, cover 97 verdant acres in the middle of South Yarra, a dense suburb bordering the city center. With 12,000 different plant species, it is a 19th-century hybrid of art and science and a sanctuary for native wildlife. The oaks, eucalyptus and Southern Chinese Garden are highlights; guided tours are $3.25. In summer, through March 6, movies ($10) are shown outdoors at twilight; garden admission is free.
Guided city tours are conducted daily, taking about two hours each and covering notable streets, intimate arcades and alleys. The two walking tours, Immigration to Town Hall, and Federation Square to Melbourne Museum, can be self-guided or you can book a guided tour ($14.25). The first tour starts at the Immigration Museum at Flinders Street at 10:30 a.m., ending at the Town Hall in time to connect with the Federation Square tour at 1 p.m. Call (61-3) 9650 3663 or go to www.visitvictoria.com. The free City Circle Tram connects the start and finish.
Short tram rides will take you to the gorgeous inner suburban centers, with long strips of Victorian architecture, rich in restaurants and boutiques, such as Bridge Road in Richmond (No. 48 tram from Flinders Street), Acland Street in St. Kilda (No. 96 from Bourke Street), and Brunswick Street in Fitzroy (No. 112 from Collins Street). This is where the artists and intellectuals hang out, and the trendy young gather.
