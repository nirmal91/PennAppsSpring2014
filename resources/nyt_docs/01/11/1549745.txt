To the Editor: Regarding ''Survey Finds Rudeness a Problem for Travelers'' (Travel Advisory, Dec. 21), an additional stress that would lead to rude behavior by air travelers is being stranded at the airport. Those uncomfortable circumstances would surely compound their anger and frustration. It is likely they may be too tired to think about the consequences of their unseemly behavior, which could escalate into physical confrontation.
