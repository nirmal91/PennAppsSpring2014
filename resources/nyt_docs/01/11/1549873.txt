To the Editor:
Since when is taking up public space with private enterprise a right? The city has the absolute right to ban all news boxes since they interfere with the ''public thoroughfare.''
Publications in coin-operated boxes are available at thousands of news vendors around the city. Other newspapers can be distributed directly to buildings, as some were in the past, and could also offer subscriptions.
All the other boxes contain little more than commercial advertising for everything from yoga classes to real estate to writing workshops. It is time to create a level playing field by eliminating all news racks.
