To the Editor:
Re ''Never Lost, but Found Daily: Japanese Honesty'' (front page, Jan. 8):
I spent several months in 1987-88 in Japan on a post-college walkabout. About six weeks into my trip, I lost my wallet, which included my identification, my parents' emergency credit cards and many thousand yen, but no Japanese contact information.
I was living in a then-sort-of-marginal part of Tokyo at a funky ryokan catering to young Western travelers and run by Japanese college students. I was in a frenzy about what to do when workers at the inn suggested I visit the local police station.
Skeptical, but armed with a Japanese-speaking Canadian I had befriended to act as an interpreter, I went. As a lifelong New Yorker, I was surprised when my wallet, with all of its contents, was waiting there for me.
I was relieved and grateful. And I was able to save face (a very Japanese concept) with my parents by not having to call to ask for more money or to replace the credit cards. I am glad to know that despite the many cultural changes that have occurred in Japan since my visit, the honesty still remains.
