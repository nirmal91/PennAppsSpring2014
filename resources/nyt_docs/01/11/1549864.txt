To the Editor:
''And You Thought Pension Funds Were Scary'' (Market Watch, Dec. 14), Gretchen Morgenson's column about the funding of future retiree medical obligations, sounded an alarm where none was warranted.
Virtually all employers offering retiree medical benefits are in the same position as Verizon, for one simple reason: Companies have options in funding retiree medical obligations, and most do so on a ''pay as you go'' basis.
Pensions -- unlike retiree health care -- are governed under Erisa law and are subject to Internal Revenue Service funding requirements. This means that pension benefits are protected under the Erisa regulations, and funding is fully tax-advantaged.
There are no similar benefit protections or legal requirements to fund retiree medical. Since there is only limited ability to fund these benefits on a tax-advantaged basis, the majority of companies, including Verizon, pay these costs out of corporate cash rather than fund the obligations years in advance. And we follow all applicable accounting standards in accounting for retiree medical obligations.
