With its new ad campaign, ''Every Body Needs Something,'' Bally Total Fitness is aiming to appeal not only to fitness buffs, but also to those who have less-than-stellar dieting or exercise habits.
One such person is Bally's chairman and chief executive, Paul Toback. Mr. Toback, who took over as head of the company about a year ago, said he ''grimaced'' when he first saw a new Bally commercial that shows a string of delivery people bringing pizza, chicken and other fast food to the same house.
Though Mr. Toback, a runner who has a gym in his home, tries to work out at least five times a week, he said he often succumbs to the lures of fast food.
''I am a closet pizzaholic,'' he said. ''I hang my head whenever I see that ad.''
