To the Editor:
When it comes to poorly funded pension and retiree health care plans, the main culprit is Congress, not the companies that are providing these benefits.
Congress needs to develop a long-term policy on retirement benefits. Is it good social policy for workers to have employment-based retirement benefits? If so, Congress should create a framework that encourages companies to supplement Social Security and Medicare with employer-provided coverage and at the same time give companies the flexibility to fund the benefits during both good times and bad.
Currently, pension law encourages companies to fund their pension plans during ''bad times,'' when the economy is weak, stock markets are low and interest rates have been lowered to stimulate economic growth. These are the economic periods when companies can least afford to fund their pension plans.
