To deal with issues surrounding a sticky organism that has been around for millions of years, but has recently been a source of increasing litigation, the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums will hold a seminar on mold at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Hexter Lounge at the Hunter College School for Social Work, 120 East 79th Street.
''We're being bombarded with mold litigation,'' said Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the council, ''which is why we will discuss the significance of mold, what causes it, when it is dangerous, how you prevent it and how to remediate it.''
The panel will include Edward Olmsted, president of Olmsted Environmental Services; Stephen Varone of Rand Engineering; and Steven Sladkus, a lawyer with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz who specializes in mold litigation.
''Every time there's a story about mold we are inundated with phone calls; there's panic,'' Mr. Saft said. ''The problem is that -- unlike lead paint or asbestos, which once they're removed are gone forever -- removing mold does not mean it won't be back next month. So you not only have to remove mold, you have to find and eliminate the cause. On the other hand, not all mold is dangerous and has to be removed.''
Reservations can be made by calling the council at (212) 496-7400 or online at workshops@cnyc.coop.
Postings  Correction:  January 11, 2004, Sunday  A report in the Postings column of the Real Estate section today about a seminar on mold to be held Tuesday, misstated the address of the host institution and misstated part of its name. The location, at 129 East 79th Street (not 120), is Hexter Lounge of the Hunter College School of Social Work -- not ''for Social Work.''
