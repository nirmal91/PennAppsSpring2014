Two picture captions in this section last Sunday with an article about retro trends in architecture misidentified the streetlamps shown. The front-page photo showed straight-armed highway lights; the other photo showed modified cobra-head lights. Neither depicted a bishop crook.
Another picture with the continuation of the article, captioned ''Saatchi &amp; Saatchi loft,'' was published in error; only a small part of the building was visible at the rear.
A caption with a photo of railings on the Hudson River misstated the location. It was near Christopher Street, not Chelsea Piers.
