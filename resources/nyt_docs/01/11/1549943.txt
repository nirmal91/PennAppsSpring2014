Oak is stately, but it should dominate lawns and not wines, especially Long Island whites. Freshness and fruitiness, not Californian woodiness, are shaping up as the region's most appealing white-wine style, as three deft releases from Lieb Family Cellars show.
Lieb's signature 2002 pinot blanc reserve ($16), 2002 Bridge Lane chardonnay ($12.50) and 2001 chardonnay reserve ($16) are models of bright, sensibly priced whites fashioned to harmonize with food. Bridge Lane is Lieb's new second label.
In all three, barrel oak is absent or tempered, while zip, balance and smooth texture are emphasized. Wisely handled by consumers and restaurants -- served moderately chilled, not icy -- they are a sheer pleasure.
In addition, their world-class performance sharpens awareness that the Premium Wine Group, in Mattituck, where they were made, is a rising economic force regionally.
Partly owned by Mark and Kathy Lieb, Premium is what the wine industry calls a custom-crush operation. It makes wine from start to finish for vintners who supply personally grown or purchased grapes but prefer not to own a winery.
Russell Hearn, a Premium partner, its winemaking superintendent, said that in the 2003 growing season, which demanded lower yields to fully ripen fruit, Premium's production went up once again.
''Our progress has been 545 tons (2000), 646 tons (2001), 692 tons (2002) and now 768 tons (2003),'' Mr. Hearn wrote. Last year, the company installed a new 4,000 bottle-an-hour bottling line, roofed the crush pad and added seven new tanks.
Lieb's 13 acres of pinot blanc grapes, some dating to 1983, have long been esteemed by other growers. Their Alsace origin and flavor are evident in the citrus peel, honey and pear flavors of the charming, lean, light 2002 edition.
The 2002 Bridge Lane chardonnay, young, zesty and awash in an apple aroma and flavor, shows hints of pear from a pinot blanc infusion. Served at parties, it will spur guests to polish off all the food. And once restaurateurs discover its versatility, it may vanish in sizable case lots.
Lieb's golden-colored, seamless 2001 chardonnay defines what should be the outer limit of tamed oakiness on the East End. Rich, fat, abloom in honey, baked apple and pear flavors, it has a noticeably lovely viscosity and underlying complexities so subtle they could go unnoticed.
Lieb wines are sold at Premium's tasting room, 35 Cox Neck Road (Route 48), Mattituck; for information: www.liebcellars.com or (631)298-1942. The Lieb Family Cellars office is in Cutchogue: (631)734-1100.
