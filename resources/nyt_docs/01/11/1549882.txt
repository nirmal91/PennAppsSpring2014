It's all right for youth to be dogmatic, but there comes a time when they must realize that there is something more than glaring basic principles, that these sometimes require fine tuning or heavy modification. Sergei Karjakin of Ukraine, at 13 the world's youngest grandmaster, had to learn a valuable lesson in his game with the 19-year-old English grandmaster Luke McShane in the third round of the Pamplona International Tournament in Spain, Dec. 20 to 28.
Most chess primers tell you that three pawns equal a minor piece, but when? In the endgame, it is not unusual for three pawns to mightily outweigh a piece, but that mostly does not hold for opening or middle-game situations. Unfortunately for him, Karjakin misjudged what stage of the game he was in at the 13th move. He gave up a knight and soon had three pawns for it.
McShane's carnage was breathtaking. Wheeling the black pieces into battle against the poorly defended white king's wing, his attack was overwhelming.
The advance 5 . . . e5, to seize space in the center, was first played by Emanuel Lasker, but he tried it only once, against Karl Schlechter, and never went back to it. It's not clear why not; the game was a draw, although it was in Lasker's favor all the way. In recent years, Evgeny Sveshnikov has done all the analysis to bring it to the forefront.
Instead of the pusillanimous 6 Nb3 Bb4, Schlechter should have tried the adventurous 6 Ndb5, as in this game.
Karjakin followed standard strategy in exchanging with 9 Bf6; he parted with a bishop for a knight to optimize his control of the key d5 square. With the recapture 9 . . . gf, McShane also followed the accepted plan; after 10 Nd5, he was immediately able to counter the white center with 10 . . . f5.
After 12 . . . Bg7, an Anand-Kramnik game in Cap d' Agde a month and a half ago proceeded with 13 Qh5 O-O 14 O-O f4 15 Rfd1 Rb8 16 Nc2 Qd7 17 h3 a5 18 Na3 b4 19 Nb5 bc 20 bc Ne7 21 Ndc7! Rbc8 22 Ne6 fe 23 a4 and concluded with decisive attacks in the center and the queenside. Why did Karjakin try a speculative attack by sacrificing a knight with 13 Nb5?
After 15 ef, Karjakin did indeed have three pawns for his piece, but in a middle game they do not make up for a lost knight.
Even after 19 Qd6, when he had four pawns for the piece, Karjakin faced a strong attack with 19 . . . Be5 20 Qh6 Bf5! If 21 Qc6, then 21 . . . Re6 22 Qc4 Rc8 23 Qb3 Bh2! 24 Kh2 Qh4 25 Kg1 Rg8 26 Re1 Rg2! 27 Kg2 Qh3 28 Kg1 Rg6mate.
So Karjakin backed off with 21 Nf4, but after 21 . . . Bd7 22 Rad1 Rc8 23 Rd5 Qc7 24 g3 Rg8 25 Rfd1 Bg4 26 Be2 Bf5, the black pieces dominated.
After 32 Nf6, Karjakin held a material superiority, but McShane's 32 . . . Bg3! smashed his king position. After 33 Ne4 Bf4 34 Ng5 Bg5 35 Qe6 Be3 36 Kh1 Bc5 37 Bc6 Rg6 38 Qf7 Rcc6 39 bc Rcf6 40 Qd5 Qc7, Karjakin, hopelessly behind, gave up.
