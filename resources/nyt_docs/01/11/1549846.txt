In a city well supplied with Italian, French and Chinese food -- not to mention almost every known cuisine -- these restaurants offer dishes you can't find on every block.
BAHIA  (718) 218-9592; 690 Grand Street (near Graham Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; $; $25 and Under: 11/8/00.
Corn is the keystone of the Central American culinary universe, as is clear when you visit this Salvadoran restaurant. The extensive menu includes typical dishes like pupusas, corn pancakes that serve as vehicles for the satisfying flavors of small amounts of meats and vegetables that are stuffed into their centers.
EIGHT MILE CREEK  **  [rating: two stars]  (212) 431-4635; 240 Mulberry Street (near Prince Street); $$$; Review: 1/12/00.
Eight Mile Creek is cheery, outgoing and warm, with a bar scene enlivened by a scattering of Australian expats. Australian specialties include kangaroo loin served in a bed of mashed sweet potatoes with apple gratin and tamarind sauce.
KABAB KING DINER  (718) 457-5857; 73-01 37th Road (73rd Street), Jackson Heights, Queens; $; $25 and Under: 3/13/02.
Perhaps it's fitting that a place celebrating the humble kebab is as unprepossessing as this bright, cluttered Pakistani restaurant. The kebabs are moist and succulent, layered in a thick yogurt marinade.
LOMZYNIANKA  (718) 389-9439; 646 Manhattan Avenue (near Nassau Avenue); Greenpoint, Brooklyn; $25 and Under: 2/27/02.
This is one of the best of Greenpoint's many Polish restaurants. Salad and soup, supplemented by rye bread, is almost a meal. Main courses, generally rustic dishes, include tender boiled beef with a mildly sharp horseradish sauce.
MADIBA  (718) 855-9190; 195 DeKalb Avenue (near Carlton Avenue), Fort Greene, Brooklyn; $$; nytimes.com: 3/00.
This little bar and restaurant may be New York's only South African restaurant. The menu includes unfamiliar dishes like uphuthu, a ground corn porridge with marinated tomatoes and onions, and saut√©ed chicken livers peri-peri, a spicy dish of Portuguese origin, delicious on toast.
PAMIR  (212) 734-3791; 1437 Second Avenue (near 75th Street); $; $25 and Under: 12/26/01.
This friendly, attractive little Afghan restaurant is decorated with rugs and artifacts that glow in the candlelight, a remnant of distant times. In addition to meat dishes, Pamir offers the vegetarian dishes that are missing from many Afghan menus in New York.
TIBETAN YAK  (718) 779-1119; 72-20 Roosevelt Avenue, Jackson Heights, Queens; $; $25 and Under: 12/6/00.
Though it is almost directly under the Roosevelt Avenue train tracks, Tibetan Yak feels like a respite from the urban crush. The best dishes are direct and true, enhanced with gentle and occasionally gutsy seasonings like pork chili, which offers the clear taste sensation of chilies without the heat.
