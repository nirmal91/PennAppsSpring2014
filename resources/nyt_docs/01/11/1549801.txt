The Party of the Year
The party of the year was the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum's centennial dinner on Nov. 22. The party brilliantly captured the spirit of Mrs. Gardner's legendary evenings, combining wonderful pictures, architecture, music, flowers, poetry, dance and food. It was thrilling from the moment the trumpeter appeared on the balcony to announce dinner with solos by Beethoven, Mahler and Respighi to the spellbinding final act, a Spanish dancer, whose performance in the candlelit courtyard was like a great burst of fireworks. The museum triumphed under the shadow of the greatest art burglarly ever, the 1990 theft of 13 works by Vermeer, Degas and Rembrandt and others. It was clear that as it entered its second century Mrs. Gardner's creation was as magical as ever.
