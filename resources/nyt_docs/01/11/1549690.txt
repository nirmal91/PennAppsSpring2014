I was heartsick at the remembrance of Katharine Hepburn. She never could suffer fools gladly, and old age no doubt exaggerated that trait, but John Kascht's article made her appear feebleminded.
When asked if she'd like to see his sketches, Hepburn said, ''I think that's a bad idea, don't you?'' Good instincts, Kate.
Bright and sharp as ever.
