HEAVENLY DATE
And Other Flirtations.
By Alexander McCall Smith.
Canongate, $21.
The prolific Alexander McCall Smith is best known as the creator of -- and the author of several popular novels about -- the deliciously zaftig Precious Ramotswe, the proprietor of Botswana's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. McCall Smith has rummaged through his travel journals and psychic string collection for an assortment of short stories he calls ''flirtations.'' The operative word is short, while to flirt, according to my dictionary, means ''to pay amorous attention to without serious intentions or emotional commitment.'' These quick sketches, set in Switzerland, Australia, Africa and Italy sometime in the last half-century or so, whisper of literary influences -- a little O. Henry as an odd, wealthy old pair in Zurich meet to give gifts; a touch of Graham Greene in a story about a debauched Portuguese-speaking American doctor and a delicate prostitute. The longest story, ''Bulawayo,'' set in Southern Rhodesia in 1959, is a study in old-fashioned repression as two young things -- Anne, a farmer's daughter, and Michael, the orphaned, British-educated son of a lawyer -- discover the impossibility of their marriage. The cover illustration shows cocktail glasses; perhaps a more fitting description of these stories would have been aperitifs.
