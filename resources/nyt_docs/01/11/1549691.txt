My response to Katha Pollitt's article on the healthy Carolyn Heilbrun's suicide, at the age of 77, is the same as it was when I read her obituary: fury. One can hypothesize about the ''freedom'' involved in such a situation, but as a breast cancer survivor who wishes to reach the age of 77, any high-minded ideas about the reasons for Heilbrun's suicide pale next to the envy I feel that she was able to reach that age without having to deal with the trials of a major illness.
