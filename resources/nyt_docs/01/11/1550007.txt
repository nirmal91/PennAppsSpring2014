A state appeals court has ordered New York City to grant expanded public access to records about its response to the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001.
In a ruling issued Thursday by the Supreme Court's Appellate Division in Manhattan, a panel of judges ruled unanimously that personal feelings expressed by firefighters in interviews conducted by the Fire Department must be disclosed.
But the judges upheld a lower court's ruling that several other portions of the records -- including opinions of firefighters and 911 operators -- could be withheld from the news media under exemptions to the state Freedom of Information Law.
Michael A. Cardozo, corporation counsel for the city, said in a statement issued Friday that ''the decision protects the privacy of the victims of the attacks of Sept. 11, as well as the privacy of their families and survivors.''
Lawyers for The New York Times and for families of some 9/11 victims are considering appealing aspects of the decision allowing the exemptions.
The case centers on requests by The Times for access to transcripts of calls to the 911 emergency line, radio dispatches and interviews of firefighters.
The city sought to withhold portions of the records based on exemptions to the law including those for law enforcement matters, personal privacy and records of government employees giving advice to superiors.
