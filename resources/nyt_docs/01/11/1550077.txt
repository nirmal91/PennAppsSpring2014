Elzie Coleman of Newburgh (N.Y.) Free Academy ran 400 meters in 46.58 seconds to set a national high school boys' indoor record yesterday in the Hispanic Games at the Armory Track and Field Center. William Reed of Philadelphia Central High School held the former mark, 46.84, since 1986. Four hours later, Coleman anchored Newburgh's 4x400 relay and made up a 50-meter deficit from fifth place with a sparkling 46.3-second split, bringing his team home second, a meter behind Clinton of the Bronx.
