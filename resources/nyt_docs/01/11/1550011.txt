To the Editor:
Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6) are concerned that the United States is entering a new era in which its workers at almost every job level will face global wage competition -- all because of free trade and the ability to shift resources around the world more efficiently. They believe that America's trade policies should be rethought.
Any rethinking of this issue should keep in mind another issue: the income gap between rich and poor countries. One could assume from arguments in the article that American jobs would be protected if capital and technology flows into poor countries were restricted and improvements to their educational systems curtailed.
Limiting the free flow of goods and productive resources around the world would only exacerbate the world's income gap.
