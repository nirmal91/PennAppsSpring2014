Think of it as a high-end spin on the traditional hot rock massage. At the new Gloss Day Spa on the Upper East Side, an amethyst the size of a large avocado has taken the place of the usual hot lava stone. The oversize amethyst, cut in Italy and weighing 150 carats, is heated to 85 degrees, wrapped in gauze and nestled for five-minute spells on each of the client's seven ''energy centers,'' or chakras -- belly, brow, solar plexus and so forth. As part of the treatment, the spa also provides an upper-body massage and a ''detoxifying'' facial using steam and more massage. The 75-minute session ($185) is called the Haute Bijoux Hot Chakra Treatment. In addition to promoting relaxation, it is said to be spiritually cleansing -- something about the gem's purple aura. Naturally, healing effects may vary. The Gloss Day Spa is at 51 East 73rd Street, Suite 2B; www.glossdayspa.com or (212) 249-2100.
