The new Yonkers City Council has designated the Home News &amp; Times as the city's official weekly newspaper, which means the paper will regain about $40,000 a year in legal ads that it lost four years ago under a previous council.
The change was approved on Jan. 2, at the first official meeting of the newly elected City Council.
The Home News &amp; Times is owned by Ralph Martinelli, brother of ex-Mayor Angelo Martinelli and uncle of the City Council president, Richard Martinelli. Eric Arena, a spokesman for the council president, said Richard Martinelli has ''no financial interest or connection'' to the uncle who owns the paper.
Under the previous council, the designation of the city's official weekly newspaper was given to the Westchester County Business Journal, along with The Journal News. At the recent council meeting, the latter was redesignated the other official daily newspaper.
