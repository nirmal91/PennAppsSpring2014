With the craze for knitting and crocheting, it is not surprising to find jewelers picking up needle and thread to knot beads and stones into jewelry. But there's nothing arts-and-crafty about the result. Renée Price, director of the Neue Galerie, a museum and design shop devoted to early-20th-century German and Austrian art (212-628-6200), is importing the work of women in Vienna who make knotted jewelry using Bohemian glass beads salvaged from 1920's handbags. The collection, from $100, includes the pale blue earrings ($250), pastel necklace ($2,000) and a red, white and black bracelet ($400), above. Inspired by Wiener Werkstätte jewelry designs, the pieces are so finely made that no threads are visible. Stefan Hemmerle, a Munich jeweler, also offers earrings knotted with tiny semiprecious stones like moonstones and garnets. A sampling of his pieces, starting at $7,000, is at Lucca &amp; Company, (212) 741-0400.
