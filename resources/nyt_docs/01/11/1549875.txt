To the Editor:
Your article on WBAI (''Let a Thousand Factions Bloom,'' Dec. 28) offered a good snapshot of what has happened at the station. I have been a longtime listener and supporter of the Pacifica station in Southern California, KPFK-FM, and I have tried to understand the chaos in our network for the past two years.
In my experience, those currently in control of the network do not fairly represent many thousands of longtime Pacifica listeners who have been sitting on the sidelines and watching this spectacle with concern. The ''movement to save Pacifica'' has accomplished an unfriendly takeover of the network with strong-arm tactics, harassment, employee insubordination and malicious lawsuits that have nearly destroyed the network.
