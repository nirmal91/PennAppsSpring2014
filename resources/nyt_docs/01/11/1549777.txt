Restaurants often keep loaner jackets and neckties around to spiff up underdressed guests; now Walls√©, the Austrian restaurant in Greenwich Village, is bundling up its smokers in style. When a diner nips out for a cigarette, a hostess hands over a cozy designer cape. ''This is the first winter that there's no smoking in restaurants, so I had to adjust,'' said Kurt Gutenbrunner, the owner and head chef. ''In Vienna, where I grew up, the carriage drivers give riders warm blankets. Since my guests usually check their coats when they come in, I wanted to give them something to wear while they stood in the cold.''
Created by Han Feng, a New York fashion designer, the unisex capes, made of wool and cashmere, tie at the neck and reverse from black to red. They are clearly a hit with customers, and Mr. Gutenbrunner is ordering more. But the restaurant isn't offering them for sale; for $800 you can get one from the designer, (212) 695-9509.
