I understand from your introduction that you could not possibly be comprehensive in covering all those who died this year. Wisely, you omitted stories that were well covered elsewhere (Bob Hope, Senators Moynihan and Thurmond, etc.). But Bill Mauldin, the greatest (by far) cartoonist of World War II, died. Those of us in Italy during the war (I was in the 88th Infantry Division) looked forward to every issue of Stars and Stripes for Mauldin's cartoon. He told the truth about the war, while most correspondents (excepting Ernie Pyle) were evading the truth or just plain lying.
