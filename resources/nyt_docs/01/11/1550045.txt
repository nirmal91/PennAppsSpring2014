To the Editor:
I would like to clarify one point regarding ''Trying to Avoid a Train Wreck'' (In Person, Jan. 4), which focused on Martin Robins, director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers, and the critical transportation issues facing New Jersey.
Ralph Voorhees provided funds to start the Voorhees Transportation Center in the form of a pledge made in 1997 as an endowment bequest in his will. He makes annual contributions toward that bequest. His brother, Alan, is also a generous supporter of this important New Jersey resource. Somehow, the statement ''when Rutgers received a bequest to form a transportation center'' sounds as though Ralph is deceased, and he is decidedly not. Both he and his brother are staunch supporters of Rutgers and are very much involved in the life of the university.
