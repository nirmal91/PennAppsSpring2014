The stock market finished higher again last week, despite a decline on Friday, after a disappointing employment report startled many investors.
The Nasdaq Composite index rose 4 percent for the week, despite a decline of 0.63 percent decline on Friday. Shares of computer and semiconductor companies were among the strongest performers.
Among the Dow industrial stocks, Intel, with a 5.51 percent increase last week, was among the leaders. But on Friday, the market stumbled, with the Dow falling 1.26 percent, its biggest drop since October, after the Labor Department reported that payrolls expanded by only 1,000 jobs last month -- vastly fewer than the 150,000 expected by a consensus of economists. The government also reported that factory employment dropped by 26,000 jobs; no change had been expected.
For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.04 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 10,458.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.38 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 1,121.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 80.24 points, to close at 2,086.92.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 4.08 percent on Friday, compared with 4.37 percent a week earlier.
