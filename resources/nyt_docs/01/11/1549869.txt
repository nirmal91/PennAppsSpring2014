BOOK -- ''Becoming a Category of One: How Extraordinary Companies Transcend  Commodity and Defy Comparison'' by Joe Calloway (2003)
WHY -- ''I'm given many management/business books by friends, colleagues and  business partners but have little time to read. As a result, a book I read cover to cover has to resonate with me. Although I'm not finished with Calloway's book, it is one that strikes that chord. My business, home mortgage lending, is very competitive and is largely a commodity business. Gaining  market share is vital to success, and focusing on how you are different from your competitors is the key to unlocking additional business.''

BOOK -- ''Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle'' by Matthew Symonds, with contributions by Larry Ellison (2003)
WHY -- ''Since I'm in the midst of building a software company, I wanted to read more about Ellison's idea that there will only be one or two software companies in the world. I think I'll keep making software. Software that's built to be  adopted from the bottom up to provide value to both users and the companies where they work, drives enough value to enable a whole new set of companies. I'll have to respectfully (very respectfully) disagree with Larry on this one.''
