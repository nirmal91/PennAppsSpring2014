To the Editor:
That Libya was induced to give up its nonconventional weapons program after sanctions illustrates how economic sanctions, while slow, do work, and therefore how completely unnecessary the war with Iraq was (news article, Jan. 8).
The war with Iraq will cost billions of dollars that could have been much better spent hunting Al Qaeda, destroying the nuclear stockpiles in Russia and working with other countries to destroy other nonconventional weapons.
