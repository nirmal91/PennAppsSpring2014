To the Editor:
In his review+of Demi's ''Muhammad'' (Children's Books, Dec. 21), Nicholas D. Kristof complains that the story of Muhammad is told from the Muslim point of view,+concluding that it is both propagandist and a shrewd business move to appeal to American Muslim readership.
As an American+Muslim, I wonder why it is disappointing to anyone that a book on Muhammad is written for the common readership from the Muslim point of view. Growing up, I always read+Christmas stories+about the divinity of Jesus told from the point of view of Christian belief. Dramatic stories of Moses parting the Red Sea did not include+awkward and distancing asides that said it is mainly Christians and Jews who consider this parting to be fact.
This story is our story that is being told. We are a growing community in this society,+and we don't want to read of ourselves as outsiders, as Others. For you, the story of Muhammad may be a tour of another religion, but that is not the sole way to present this story. If you feel a need to, go ahead and footnote the story of the revelation of the Koran to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel with the explanation to your children that this is what Muslims believe.
For myself, I am delighted to find myself in the story, and to find the world accommodating my identity, my life.
