A faithful reader of the Letters column, I was especially drawn to the replies to Harriet McBryde Johnson's article (Nov. 23) because of a disability of my own. Much to my surprise, I saw a letter from a colleague I had not heard from in 25 years. We re-established contact. Thank you for a fine article and for bringing people of shared concerns together.
