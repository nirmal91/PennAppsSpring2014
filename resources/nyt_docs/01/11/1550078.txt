AMERICAN football CONFERENCE  Indianapolis Colts (13-4) at Kansas City Chiefs (13-3)  1 p.m., CBS
The last time these teams met in the playoffs was in January 1996. The Chiefs seemed like a dominating team on the way to the Super Bowl. They had home-field advantage in the playoffs and lost to Indianapolis, 10-7, in a game where the Chiefs made four turnovers. It was a shocking loss for the Chiefs.
Now, most of the names and faces in Kansas City have changed. The Chiefs gained an extra week of rest with their bye and many would say the Colts did, too, exerting their will in a 41-10 playoff pasting of Denver last week. Both teams have sensational and electric players; topping their lists are receiver Marvin Harrison for the Colts and kick returner Dante Hall for the Chiefs.
The quarterbacks -- Petyton Manning and Trent Green -- produced big seasons, and Manning is coming off a five-touchdown passing game against Denver. Both made the Pro Bowl. Both were the league's only 4,000-yard passers. They direct the top two offenses in the American Football Conference, with Kansas City No. 1, averaging 369.4 yards a game and Indianapolis No. 2, averaging 367.1 yards.
With so much focus on the offenses, the defenses could be the difference. Which defense will slow an offense enough for its team to win this expected shootout? Some of the best matchups will be in the trenches, especially when the Chiefs' mobile offensive line meets the Colts' flexible defensive line. Keep a close eye on a Herculean clash -- Chiefs tackle Willie Roaf versus Colts end Dwight Freeney.
