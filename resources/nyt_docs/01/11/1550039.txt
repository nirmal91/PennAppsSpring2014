Funny Cide, the New York-bred gelding who won last year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness, made his 4-year debut in impressive style at Gulfstream Park on Saturday.
On an atypically cool 60-degree day, Funny Cide showed no hint of the respiratory problem that hurt him in his final two races last year. He finished the seven-eighths of a mile in 1:22.83, winning by five lengths in a field of five.
''He was doing it all himself,'' his jockey, Jose Santos, said. ''You could see how strong he was because I needed the outrider to help me pull him up.''
When last seen in a race, Funny Cide wheezed and coughed to a ninth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic in October at Santa Anita. The field that day was strong, but the 101-degree temperature virtually assured his fate, his trainer, Barclay Tagg, and owners found out.
Last August, on a humid 94-degree day at Monmouth Park, Funny Cide finished a lackluster third in the Haskell Invitational.
''It's been pretty much decided that he's not a hot-weather horse,'' said Jack Knowlton, managing partner of Sackatoga Stable, which owns Funny Cide.
Funny Cide's aim is the Grade I Donn Handicap on Feb. 7 at Gulfstream over a mile and an eighth. After that, his owners are looking at the New Orleans Handicap in late February at the Fairgrounds.
