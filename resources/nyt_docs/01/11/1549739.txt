To the Editor: The articles devoted to Las Vegas's being ''over the top'' were most entertaining. However, after seven business trips and one personal visit, I note that appropriate metaphors are still lacking.
The French have coined the term ''Cultural Chernobyl'' and directed it at Euro Disney. Too bad, because it also fits Las Vegas very well.
