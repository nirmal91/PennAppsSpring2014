Given all the accomplished people whose passing was barely noted, imagine my perplexity at discovering the honor of your cover given to Dorothy J. Farnan, famous for much the same reason as Lady Diana's butler. I attended Erasmus Hall High School during Farnan's chairmanship of the English department, and her descriptions of Auden (''rude,'' ''exasperating,'' ''moody,'' ''forbidding'') could easily have been applied to Farnan herself.
