An article last Sunday about living in Carmel, N.Y., misstated the number of graduates of its high school last year, as well as the figures for those going on to colleges. There were 327 graduates, not 329. Of those, 194 went to four-year schools and 92 attended two-year colleges (116 and 88 were the figures for those who went to schools in New York State).
