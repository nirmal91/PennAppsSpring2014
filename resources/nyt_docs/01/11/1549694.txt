It is hard not to conclude that Melanie Thernstrom's ugly little vignette was included to bash men and empower women (the Mrs. won in the end) and to malign the institution of marriage.
I'm sure Thernstrom and The Times rationalized its inclusion for all kinds of other reasons, but really, who's kidding whom?
