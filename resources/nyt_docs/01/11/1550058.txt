The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre is in compliance with new standards enacted by the United States Conference of Bishops for the protection of children, according to an outside audit released last week by the bishops' group.
An investigation of 191 dioceses by independent auditors, including former F.B.I. agents, found that 20 dioceses, including the Archdiocese of New York, were not yet in compliance with the charter, which the bishops adopted in June 2002.
The audit commended the Rockville Centre diocese, under Bishop William F. Murphy, for developing an effective outreach program for victims of sexual abuse by priests. It said that since Bishop Murphy's arrival on Long Island in 2001 the diocese had maintained ''an open and continuing dialogue'' with civil authorities and had reported all allegations of sexual abuse to those authorities even in cases where the statute of limitations had expired.
Denis McKeown of Manhasset, a founding member of Long Island Voice of the Faithful, a grassroots group that formed after the Catholic sexual abuse scandal became public, said the audit results appeared favorable for the Rockville Centre diocese.
''I am glad it has come out so,'' he said. ''However, the problems still exist and the audit does not relate to the financial overview that the laity should have in each and every diocese in America.''
In August the group called on Bishop Murphy to resign after a report by the Massachusetts attorney general named him as one of several former top church officials in the Archdiocese of Boston who valued protecting the church and predator priests more than protecting children. Bishop Murphy was the No. 2 official in the archdiocese before coming to Long Island.
