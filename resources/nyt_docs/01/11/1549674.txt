THE TOUCH
By Colleen McCullough.
Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.95.
Colleen McCullough is an icon of the sweeping, multigenerational family saga. More than 25 years and several subsequent novels after ''The Thorn Birds,'' she returns to Australia and the themes she is best known for -- opulent wealth mingled with tragedy, exotic locales and family conflicts, and embers of passion that smolder for decades before sparking into ''one unforgettable ascent into paradise,'' preferably near a picturesque body of water. It's not surprising, then, that ''The Touch'' feels like a work written less to be read than to be cast -- a mini-series with a perfunctory first incarnation as a novel. At the center is Alexander Kinross, a Scotsman of inauspicious birth who rises to become ''quite the richest man in the colony'' of New South Wales. Kinross is a Midas who can smell gold in a mountain but ruefully asks himself, ''Why am I so surrounded, yet so alone?'' He's flanked by the repressed wife he trapped into a loveless marriage, his salty-tongued mistress and both women's children, who mature to commence their own dramatic arcs. McCullough has an easy gift for measuring out drama in precisely calibrated doses of sex, violence and historic fact, but the novel goes through the motions without allowing itself a moment of risk or spontaneity.
