To the Editor:
In ''Forget the Drought'' (In Brief, Jan. 4) you report that New Jersey had its fourth-wettest year on record in 2003 and that our six wettest years have all been since 1972. New Jersey is not unusual in this respect. The United States Global Change Research Program reports that atmospheric moisture has grown by 10 percent over the northern temperate zone in the last century. And we can expect more of this wetter weather. In its 2001 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the average global water vapor concentration and precipitation are projected to increase in the 21st century.
