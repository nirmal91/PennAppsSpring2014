New Jersey indeed has a special place in the thoughts of corporate tax executives and their companies across the nation. In fact, they told CFO magazine that New Jersey is the absolute worst in what the magazine's recent survey called ''state tax environments.'' And the main reason is what Governor McGreevey called ''closing loopholes'' in the corporate business tax two years ago.
The survey's findings, which appear in the magazine's January issue, note that New Jersey ''crashed the top five'' after the budget balancing of summer 2002. Remembering that year, the year of the tax-law changes that doubled receipts from the corporate business tax, Philip Kirschner, the president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said: ''We told you so.''
The changes, Mr. Kirschner said, ''have been noticed around the country by decision makers,'' or at least by the people who answered the survey.
The magazine asked eight questions about tax laws, and New Jersey scored among the worst five states in all but one category (that was about the independence of the state's tax courts). It was an especially remarkable showing, the magazine said, because in 2000 New Jersey did not make the worst five in any question.
The good news for Trenton is that businesses looking to flee New Jersey will find the neighboring states terrible, too; after New Jersey, the four worst, in overall performance, were California, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania.
A note -- or warning -- to companies looking to relocate: the three best states were Nevada, Wyoming and Vermont.
