THE ROPE EATER
By Ben Jones.
Doubleday, $24.
Somewhere near the climax of Ben Jones's first novel, one character, in a haze of madness and starvation, makes a snack of his frostbitten thumb. The description will cure even the most avid fingernail biter, and the scene is extremely wrenching. It is also emblematically dubious. In ''The Rope Eater,'' Jones melds literature with the ripping yarn, sending a Civil War deserter named Brendan Kane to search for a mythical verdant valley in the Arctic. All the adventure ingredients are present: extreme ice, doggedness and a troupe of freaky salts (the ''beefy, red-headed giant of a man,'' the mystic captain, the three-handed boiler stoker). But they are often poorly managed. The characters, for example, don't talk enough; the author too much. And he has, it seems, read quite a bit of García Márquez. So the three-handed boiler stoker, left on a crippled, ice-bound vessel, expends his last breath scratching a story on the hull. Kane discovers this and, even though he can't decipher the stoker's native tongue, is unbearably moved. Overreaching in a first novel is excusable. When Jones shows rather than tells, he soars. ''I would tear out my eyes,'' the captain says, ''if it would help me to see more of God.'' Who wouldn't?
