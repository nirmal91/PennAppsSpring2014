Portland school officials are close to having the town's police dog sniff high school lockers and parking lots for drugs.
The superintendent of schools, Joseph R. Castagnola, said the plan is the result of complaints from students, parents and residents who live near the high school.
''Our intent is not to trick anyone,'' Mr. Castagnola said. ''Our intent is to keep all students safe and provide a safe learning environment.''
Despite privacy concerns, Christine L. Chinni, the lawyer for the Board of Education, said the policy would be legal because students would not be undergoing body searches.
''It's not a so-called search to have a dog sniff belongings, she said. ''So it's not even a legally cognizable issue under the Fourth Amendment.''
Theresa C. Younger, executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, agreed, but believes the policy raises concerns about ''search and seizure'' and ''proper cause'' standards.
''We're incredibly concerned about the use of sniffer dogs and their reliability,'' she said. ''Young people do not leave their rights at the schoolhouse door.''
Peter J. Parazino, the Portland Police Department's canine officer, said the dog, an 18-month-old German shepherd named Niko, was certified by the North American Police Work Dog Association. He said the random searches would take place outside the presence of students.
Mr. Castagnola said the Board of Education had received a positive response to the plan, which he said could eventually be extended to the town's middle school.
He said the parents of all high school students would be informed of the plan by letter before the sniffing begins.
