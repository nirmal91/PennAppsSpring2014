To the Editor: As an Elderhostel Ambassador (a volunteer who speaks to groups about Elderhostel's programs) and a ''graduate'' of more than 40 programs, I was disturbed by Alan Oser's article.
I am not a gambler (or gamer, as they call it in Vegas) or a drinker or a girlie-show-goer. But when I attended that program in Las Vegas some time ago, I attended every lecture, participated in every field trip and visited every casino on the Strip.
I learned, I enjoyed, I interacted with my fellow Elderhostelers and can now deal blackjack, watch baccarat and understand what is happening and keep away from the spinning wheels that produce such a bonanza for the casino owners.
We have a name for people who come to a program prepared to dislike it. We call them Hostile Elders.
