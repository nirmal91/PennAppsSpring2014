To the Editor:
Re ''A Partner in Shaping an Assertive Foreign Policy'' (front page, Jan. 7):
I was chilled to read how Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, can, you say, ''explain Middle East policy in five digestible bites.''
Having served there as a Foreign Service officer, in Saudi Arabia, I think that it's a bit more complex than that. But then again, I would've had an endgame plan for Iraq.
