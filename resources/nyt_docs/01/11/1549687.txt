Each year, I devour this issue (Dec. 28), enjoying its decidedly egalitarian approach. It's always a relief from the formulaic year-end roundups.
This year was no exception. I'd like, especially, to commend the closing tribute. This year, it was to Claude Martel, whose work for the magazine resonated as often as the stories themselves. Thanks for bringing his name to my attention. His work was already there.
