Howard G. Capek, a former UBS research analyst, was hand-picked by Richard M. Scrushy, the founder and former chairman of HealthSouth, to cover the company, according to a recent lawsuit by investors.
Mr. Capek was the last analyst to remain bullish on HealthSouth, whose executives were found last year to have engaged in sweeping accounting fraud, the suit said, and he continued to give the stock a strong buy rating until an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into accusations of insider trading became public in 2002.
He resigned from UBS last summer after bank executives discovered an e-mail message in which he said he would not own the stock, just months after he had given the stock the highest possible rating.
The suit, filed last week in United States District Court in the Northern District of Alabama, contends that Mr. Capek also knew that the company was inflating its earnings.
''That Capek would be loyal to Scrushy is hardly surprising as UBS invited Scrushy to select the analyst to issue reports on the company once the prior analyst had left that post; UBS hired Capek at specific direction of Scrushy, who was pleased with the reports Capek had issued on HealthSouth while an analyst at Credit Suisse,'' the suit said.
Lawyers for both Mr. Capek and Mr. Scrushy said Mr. Capek had not been hired at Mr. Scrushy's direction, and Mr. Capek's lawyer said the analyst was unaware of any fraud at HealthSouth. A spokesman for UBS said that no one at the company had any knowledge of fraud at HealthSouth but would not comment further.
