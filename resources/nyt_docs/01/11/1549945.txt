The University Diner in Union is typical of the genre in most respects. Open seven days a week, it serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with a menu as long as your arm. But what sets this diner apart is its matzo ball soup.
In fact, regulars call it the Matzo Ball Diner. The soup is $2.75 a bowl, or free with dinner specials.
''I make about 110 matzo balls a day,'' said George Makras, who has owned the diner for six years with his brother Peter. ''Come the weekend, I up the ante to 500. Recently, I delivered 25 quarts of matzo ball soup to one customer.''
Peter Makras added, ''Our daily specials and our matzo ball soup keep people coming.''
The daily specials, served from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, include a huge cup of soup, rice or potato, fresh vegetable, beverage and dessert. Recent offerings were fillet of sole fran√ßaise and fried flounder ($9.50).
Three-hour breakfast specials start at 7 a.m. Choices include a short stack of pancakes or two eggs any style with home fries, toast, two slices of bacon and coffee ($3.95). Omelette mavens crave the grilled chicken breast with garden vegetables.
Loyal customers are legion.
''Forget the diet,'' said Daniel Hussey of Colonia. ''Order dessert. Chocolate pudding with fresh whipped cream, and house-baked pies are included in the specials. The price is really right.''
But the owners remain a somewhat modest duo.
''A diner is a diner,'' George Makras said. ''We go the extra mile. We serve the freshest and the best.''
