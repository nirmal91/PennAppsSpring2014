To the Editor: In ''Wilderness Is Becoming Less Wild'' (Dec. 21) the author describes mixed feelings when a fellow skier is bailed out of an accident by helicopter. He regrets a sense of self-reliance, but is glad he had a cellphone.
People will always take risks, and a yearning for adventure is understandable. But if they want the benefits of modern technology and rescue, should the public have to pay? Risk takers could contribute to an insurance or rescue fund before getting permits to explore the wilderness. That way they would bear responsibility for their actions.
