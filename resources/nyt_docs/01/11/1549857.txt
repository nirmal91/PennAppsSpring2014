Can Salem, Mass., shed its ''witchy'' reputation? One real estate developer is betting on it. In May, J. Hilary Rockett Jr., owner of Rockett Management and Realty in Marblehead, Mass., will open the 101-room Salem Waterfront Hotel and Suites, the city's first new hotel in 50 years.
Mr. Rockett, who was born and raised in Marble Head, next to Salem, is hoping that a recent restaurant resurgence in the area, and the completion of the $125 million expansion last July of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem will attract more tourists to the area.
While the city's witch history will undoubtedly continue to be a major draw, Mr. Rockett said he is relieved to see visitors come to Salem for other reasons. ''Personally, I've never been into all of that hocus-pocus stuff,'' he said.
