To the Editor:
Re ''War of Ideas, Part 1'' (column, Jan. 8):
Thomas L. Friedman suggests that one way of deterring terrorists is to make them ashamed of what they do.
Vain hope! If they are not already ashamed of targeting and murdering innocent people, what is the likelihood that we shall teach them, or those who support them, shame?
