To the Editor:
Contrary to Laura Miller's essay ''The Lost Boy'' (Dec. 14), the new ''Peter Pan'' movie is not ''the first live-action film'' based on J. M. Barrie's play. In 1924, Paramount released a silent ''Peter Pan'' starring an 18-year-old newcomer named Betty Bronson as Peter. The role had been sought by Lillian Gish, Bessie Love, Mary Pickford and Gloria Swanson, but Barrie preferred to fill the part with an unknown, and personally approved the casting of Bronson. A huge commercial success in its day, ''Peter Pan'' was restored in 1995 and is now available on DVD and VHS.
