When the air is cold and the landscape bare, gardeners get out their catalogues and start planning their springtime activities. If they can't be in their fields, they want to gather and talk about them. The Northeast Organic Farming Association of New Jersey will hold a winter conference, ''Greener Fields: Opportunity and Challenge of Organic Agriculture,'' on Jan. 31 at Cook College Center at Rutgers University. One of the topics, ''Exploring the Small Farm Dream,'' is a short version of the sold-out, four-part class held last fall at Mercer County Community College, and it will be repeated in April and May.
The organic farming association, based in Pennington, is the premier agricultural organization in New Jersey. Karen Anderson, executive director, says that the conference is not just for professionals; the association hopes to attract a cross-section of attendees. ''We're all stakeholders in the food system,'' she said. ''We all eat. Some of us just pay more attention.''
It's tough to run a successful small farm in New Jersey. Land and help are expensive, weather is unpredictable, and the economy is still shaky. But it is an attraction to many people, ranging from financially challenged property owners in a search of a tax break to those who have made money on Wall Street and long for a field that will let them feel more grounded (Ms. Anderson's pun).
The conference, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., is meant to give would-be farmers some tough questions and allow them see what it might take to make their dream a success. Seventeen sessions will be presented, including selling at farmers markets, organic viticulture, financial planning for farmers, e-marketing and cultivation equipment.
