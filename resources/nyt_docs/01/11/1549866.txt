To the Editor:
Re ''The Goal: 'Sweatshop Free.' The Problem: Defining It'' (Dec. 14): It certainly isn't surprising that some apparel manufacturers want to do well by doing good and saying they operate ''sweatshop free.''
But this label should mean more than saying only where clothing is made and how.
If ''sweatshop free'' is to be a real effort to reduce worker exploitation, it must also include preproduction work (for example, who made the cloth and dyes?) and post-production work (was the clothing transported by exploited seamen and truck drivers?).
