That carousel on eBay may look familiar.
It seems the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which runs the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, is looking for a home for its old carousel -- the one you would put the children on while waiting in the scorching August sun for your ship to come in.
In the old days, the authority might have held an auction or sought bids by newspaper. But this is the modern era, and the agency has put the carousel, a 20-horse model, up for bids on eBay.
The carousel, built in 1955 by the Allen Herschell Company, operated at the Cape May terminal from 1996 until 2001, when it was put in storage. The authority had tried to enhance ridership by upgrading the landscaping, the food court and the entertainment, so it bought the carousel from Dollywood, the singer Dolly Parton's amusement park in Tennessee, for $55,000. But the authority stopped using it three years ago to concentrate more on actual ferry operations.
The authority put an initial bid of $40,000 when it started the auction last Monday, and final bids are due Wednesday.
The specifications of the bid on eBay indicate that any buyer has to take the carousel as is. Hmmm.
''The wood platform has buckled in spots and a careful inspection and replacement of deteriorated wood must be accomplished before operation,'' the specifications read.
But there is also a hopeful note: ''When last used in 2001, the carousel's electric motor operated well.''
