Images of the Long Island Expressway and its surroundings are in an exhibition that opened early this month in Huntington. The show is made up of 20 black-and-white photographs from a study that includes over 600 taken along the length of the highway over the last two years. The work was done by Robert Toedter, a professor of photography at Nassau Community College in Garden City.
The pictures are on display with another show of Mr. Toedter's work, ''N.P.L.,'' color photographs of the areas around Long Island sites that are on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priority List.
Both shows run through Jan. 31 at the Foto Foto Gallery, 372 New York Avenue, Huntington. Information: (631)549-0448.
