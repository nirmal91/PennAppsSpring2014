Hoping to attract investors and developers, Bridgeport Mayor John M. Fabrizi wants to open the boarded-up Majestic (below) and Palace theaters for a week of public viewing this spring.
With a combined 7,000 seats, the two Main Street theaters, once straddled by the 109-room Hotel Savoy, were opened in 1922 by the theater magnate Sylvester Poli. They featured silent films, vaudeville shows and eventually modern motion pictures. Now owned by the city, along with the land on which they sit, they have been closed since 1979.
Mr. Fabrizi would like to see one of the theaters refurbished if money becomes available, but said it was time to think about another kind of redevelopment.
''If there are no resources to make things happen,'' he said, ''how much longer do you let a vacant building stand on prime land?''
State Representative Christopher L. Caruso, a Democrat representing Bridgeport, was a member of a panel set up by the city a few years ago that secured some money for the theaters and commissioned a study to explore what to do with them. He said he suggested to Mr. Fabrizi that the city seek municipal, state and private funding to renovate the 3,900-seat Palace for touring Broadway shows, as other cities have done with similar theaters.
Mr. Caruso said further redevelopment of the area would be needed to make the theater successful, but said the project would be a boost to the city's economy.
