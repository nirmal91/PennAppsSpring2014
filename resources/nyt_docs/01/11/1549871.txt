To the Editor:
Your article ''City Council Ponders Playing Musical News Boxes. Again'' (Jan. 4) suggests that publishers are being victimized by overly enthusiastic enforcement of the new law regulating size, location and neatness of sidewalk news racks. That's unfair.
The City Council should be congratulated on passing these regulations. Testifying at the hearings, the Municipal Art Society urged a much more stringent law. We reluctantly accepted a watered-down version that had been scrutinized and sanctioned by publishers and the box owners who promised that they would comply with this law. Now those same parties are crying foul.
We don't need to further dilute the law. Let's have some fair play on behalf of the public interest and nicer, less congested sidewalks.
