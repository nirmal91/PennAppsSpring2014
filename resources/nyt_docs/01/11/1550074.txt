I am concerned about the idea of moving Southampton Hospital into the public sector and having it join with Stony Brook University Hospital [''Southampton Hospital Is Urged to Merge,'' Jan. 4]. State aid might help in the efforts to decrease the debt that Southampton Hospital has acquired over the years due to mismanagement, but it should stay private and the community it serves should come to its rescue.
