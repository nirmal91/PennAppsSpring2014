IN THE MISO SOUP
By Ryu Murakami.
Kodansha International, $22.95.
Kenji, a 20-year-old Japanese ''night life guide'' -- basically, someone who takes foreign tourists to the establishments that put the boom in Tokyo's booming sex trade -- has an uneasy feeling about Frank, an American who has hired him for three nights leading up to the New Year. Even so, neither Kenji nor the reader is prepared for the gruesome turn of events on the two men's second evening together. Yet it is a testament to the strengths of Ryu Murakami's novel that it is ultimately defined not by its explicit depictions of violence and sex but instead by its misfit characters. In this skillful translation by Ralph McCarthy, Kenji is an appealing narrator, observant without being judgmental and nervous without being melodramatic; even the intensely creepy Frank is not entirely unsympathetic. As Kenji and Frank make their way through the seedy streets, stopping in at peep shows and ''lingerie pubs,'' Murakami deftly drops into this slim book both fascinating sociological details about the sex industry and often moving philosophical arguments about the forces that shape individual and national identity. In the end, Kenji suggests, the sex trade is less about sex than about loneliness -- and Kenji himself is less guide than follower as Frank provides a grisly tour of the darkness and confusion of the human mind.
