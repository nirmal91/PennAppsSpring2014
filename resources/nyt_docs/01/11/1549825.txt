The British critic Oz Clarke opens his 2004 ''Pocket Wine Guide'' (Harcourt) praising Austrian grüner veltliner and deploring oaky chardonnays. Similarly, his approval of wines from Bürklin-Wolf (Germany), Léon Beyer (Alsace) and Castel, Galil Mountain and Tishbi (Israel) hit the bull's-eye. His ''top value wines'' and ''best look-alikes to the classics'' repay the $14 cost.
