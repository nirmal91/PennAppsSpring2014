A federal jury in Central Islip has rejected a claim by a retired Suffolk County deputy police inspector that he was denied a promotion because of anti-Semitism and in retaliation for critical comments he made about the department at a 1987 Suffolk legislative hearing.
A seven-member jury deliberated eight hours before rendering its verdict Dec. 16 after a six-day trial before Judge Denis Hurley, said Alan Polsky of Bohemia, lawyer for the plaintiff, Howard E. Mandell.
''I was very happy that a jury decided I am not a bigot,'' said the Suffolk police commissioner, John C. Gallagher, who along with the department was named in the civil suit.
Mr. Gallagher, 66, who is retiring on Jan. 20 after 32 years of public service in which he also served as deputy Suffolk County executive, said he did not promote Mr. Mandell because there were ''other people more qualified or better suited than him.''
''It had nothing to do with anti-Semitism,'' he insisted in an interview.
Mr. Mandell of East Northport, who said he retired in January 2001 after being skipped over for advancement on 11 occasions during the preceding four years, said two key witnesses he had counted on were unavailable to help him prove his case. One, Rabbi Jeffrey Wartenberg, a police department chaplain for more than 20 years, died two years ago. The other, Suffolk County Legislator Maxine Postal, was too ill to testify. She died Jan. 1.
Mr. Polsky noted that an affidavit from Rabbi Wartenberg, in which he said he had dealt with anti-Semitism in the department on a regular basis, was admitted into evidence. But Mr. Polsky said that evidence was undercut by Rabbi Steven Moss, a current police chaplain, who testified that he was unaware of anti-Semitism in the department.
