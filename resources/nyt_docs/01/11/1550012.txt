To the Editor:
Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6) illustrate their doubts about free trade in the modern global economy with the following example: ''Within five years the number of radiologists in this country is expected to decline significantly because M.R.I. data can be sent over the Internet to Asian radiologists capable of diagnosing the problem at a small fraction of the cost.''
Perhaps I'm just an old-fashioned economist. Or maybe I'm just a consumer who is fed up with regular and substantial annual increases in my health insurance premium. But shouldn't American consumers be applauding anything that brings down the skyrocketing cost of health care?
