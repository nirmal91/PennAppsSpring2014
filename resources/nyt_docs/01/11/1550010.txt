To the Editor:
International trade has helped devastate blue-collar producers and is working its way up the income ladder (Op-Ed, Jan. 6). But the problem is not simply the movement of capital. Capital ought to flow from rich countries to poor ones rather than the reverse, which is now the case.
The law of comparative advantage has broken down because there is no longer any force that compels trade to offset every new dollar of imports with a new dollar of exports. The greater the cost differences around the world, the greater the imbalance.
The solution is to manage trade flows so that this balance can be restored by agreement when markets fail.
