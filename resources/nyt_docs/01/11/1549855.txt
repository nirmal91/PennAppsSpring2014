Kenneth A. Tucker sees clear parallels between swine and top-level executives. Mr. Tucker, a seminar leader at the Gallup Organization, and Vandana Allman, a co-worker who consults with clients about hiring practices, have written ''Animals, Inc.: A Business Parable for the 21st Century,'' to be published next month by Warner Business Books.
The book tells the story of a retiring farmer who gives his animals the chance to manage the farm. Insanity -- not to mention squawking -- breaks out as the members of the barnyard are given new roles for which they have no talent. Mo, the pig, struggles as Chief Executive Animal. A scarecrow tries to lay eggs in the henhouse.
The message is: ''The best managers succeed by simply focusing on the natural strengths that people bring to their role,'' Mr. Tucker said.
He said he noticed the similarities between animals and businesspeople even before he began working for Gallup four years ago. He often studies the personality differences between his Shih Tzu named Cupid and his toy poodle named Bubbles. ''They have their own strengths, just like people do,'' he said.
For example, he said, Cupid spends her life trying to woo people. ''She has an appetite to win others over, often by practically licking them to death,'' he said.
In contrast, he said, Bubbles ''is a killer poodle who really takes charge -- she'd make a great C.E.O.''
