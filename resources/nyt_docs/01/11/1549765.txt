Somehow it just seems wrong. You finally get to the box office, force a twenty through the window, and instead of sliding over two tickets, the cashier has the temerity to ask for more money. This is what's happening at some theaters in New York, where the once-sacred $10 ticket barrier has just been  crossed. In response, loyal filmgoers may feel like moving. But as this sampling of current Hollywood blockbuster prices shows, New York is by no means the most expensive movie town in the country or the world. (Note: in some theaters, prices vary by schedule or seat location).
