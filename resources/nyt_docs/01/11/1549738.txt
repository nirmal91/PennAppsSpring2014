To the Editor: When we asked my husband where he wanted to spend his 75th birthday, he responded, ''Las Vegas at the Bellagio.'' We're not big gamblers by any stretch, but we love the shows, the dining, the spa, the people and, believe it or not, the fabulous light show. We were able to watch it from our room.
And like everything else, enjoying Las Vegas is all about attitude.
