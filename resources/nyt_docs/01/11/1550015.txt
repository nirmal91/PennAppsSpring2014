To the Editor:
Nothing illustrates my frustration with the incessant attacks on this president better than your Jan. 8 news article ''Libyan Stagnation a Big Factor in Qaddafi Surprise.''
The suggestion is made that Libya's stagnation and growing isolation are the real reasons for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's turnaround.
When did stagnation or isolation ever cause a Muslim country to change direction?
Tyrants do not worry about the masses. Maybe, just maybe, President Bush has caught the attention of the world's despots with his invasion of Iraq.
