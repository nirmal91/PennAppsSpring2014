A letter to the editor last Sunday about a Dec. 28 article profiling notable Long Islanders who died in 2003 referred erroneously to Dr. Marvin Kuschner, the first dean of the Stony Brook University medical school. His death occurred in 2002 (on Oct. 18), not in 2003, and he was included in the 2002 year-end profiles.
