A statewide tenants group said last week it is appealing a judge's ruling upholding a vote by the Nassau County Rent Guidelines Board in June allowing landlords to raise rents from 5 to 8 percent for tenants of Nassau's estimated 16,000 rent-stabilized apartments.
The group, the New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors Coalition, had argued that the board violated the state's open meetings law by holding the meeting in a small basement cafeteria at the North Hempstead Town Hall with poor acoustics and no room for all the tenants who wished to attend.
In the ruling, Justice Joseph A. De Maro of State Supreme Court in Mineola noted that the appointed board, which includes two members representing tenants, had held four public meetings to hear public comments before the vote at the disputed meeting, which was held on June 12.
''There were significant prior public meetings where interested parties who wished to be heard had such an opportunity,'' Justice De Maro said in the Dec. 3 ruling.
Nassau, Westchester and Rockland are the only suburban counties in the state where localities were permitted to authorize rent stabilization under the Emergency Tenants Protection Act of 1974.
