State researchers unveiled their progress on developing a childproof ''smart gun'' last week while Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine and Representative Robert Menendez announced that they would seek more than $1 million in Congress to help advance the technology.
Engineers and scientists at the New Jersey Institute of Technology said they were about two years away from perfecting their ''dynamic grip technology,'' which they say will electronically store and recognize the grip pattern and pressure of a gun's owner and prevent the gun from being fired by anyone else.
In 2002 New Jersey became the first state to approve a requirement that all guns sold in the state be childproof three years after perfection of the technology.
Many opponents of the law say that such measures are riddled with mechanical flaws that make them unreliable and dangerous to gun owners.
