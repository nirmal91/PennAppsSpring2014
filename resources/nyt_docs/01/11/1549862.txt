An article last Sunday about Axel Arce, who disposes of grease from restaurants, referred incorrectly to the practice of restaurants that do not have grease traps. Their grease flows into sewage lines, not tap water supplies. The article also misstated New York City regulations on grease in restaurants. There is no requirement that it be recycled.
