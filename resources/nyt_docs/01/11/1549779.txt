In Boston, Gretchen Monahan's hair salons, beauty spas and clothing boutiques are oases of fashion. ''Standard dinner attire is a black suit or dress,'' said Ms. Monahan, who owns the Grettacole salons, G Spa and Gretta Luxe clothing boutiques, all in the Boston area. ''I try to persuade clients to live in fashion every day and not only save it for special occasions.''
To that end, Ms. Monahan, 33, gravitates toward pieces from Stella McCartney, Prada, Marc Jacobs and Barbara Bui, saying they are comfortable, packable and, most important for anyone easing into couture, ''easy to wear with T-shirts.''
So sharp are her instincts that Ms. Monahan is often tapped by the producers of ''A Makeover Story,'' the Learning Channel program, to transform featured guests from frumpy to fabulous. ''I can't get over how many people wear things that don't fit,'' she said. ''You end up looking shorter and 20 pounds heavier. I'm petite, and you'll never see me in a boxy sweater.''
Here, Ms. Monahan combines a $5,000 Alexander McQueen fox and shearling jacket, which she purchased in Milan, with Luella Bartley jeans ($210), Jimmy Choo boots ($620) and a Miu Miu bag ($545).
Come spring, she said, she will adopt a sherbet palette, along with the Pucci-esque green featured in Chlo√©'s spring 2004 collection. ''It's so luxurious and fresh with white,'' she said. ''I love a clear pop of color.''
