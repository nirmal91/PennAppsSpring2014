Visitors to Washington can explore more than two centuries of African-American history and culture with a new guide that includes information on 98 sites in the city. The sites are listed as part of 15 neighborhood walking or driving tours in the guide, ''African American Heritage Trail, Washington, DC,'' that are accompanied by maps, photographs and brief historical sketches.
Among the places are Cedar Hill, the home in Anacostia that Frederick Douglass bought, breaking the ban against nonwhite ownership; Howard University, the oldest historically black college in the United States, founded in 1867; and the newly renovated Lincoln Theater, first opened in 1922, where Duke Ellington (a Washingtonian), Pearl Bailey, Lionel Hampton, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday performed.
The free guide, a result of the city's first official effort to inventory and designate African-American sites, can be ordered at www.culturaltourismdc.org for a shipping and handling fee of $4.75, or by calling Cultural Tourism DC at (202) 661-7581.
The Web site will soon include a fuller list of about 200 African-American heritage sites in Washington.
