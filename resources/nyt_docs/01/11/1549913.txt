With most of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination focused on the Iowa caucuses just nine days away, Gen. Wesley K. Clark on Saturday looked a little further ahead -- to the year 2024 and beyond.
Speaking to a crowd of about 200 students at the New Hampshire College Convention, General Clark, who is skipping the Iowa contest, laid out his vision for America's future.
That vision includes advancements that will allow Americans to carry their genetic code in their pockets, to predict earthquakes, droughts and volcanic eruptions and to explore space beyond Mars.
''Imagine if at birth, every American received a map of their genetic code small enough to fit on a credit card,'' he said. The map, the general said, would allow a doctor to test for genetic markers of diseases that, if treated early, could be stopped almost before they start.
The students listened and applauded politely at the most futuristic of General Clark's predictions, laid out in a 45-minute speech in this southern New Hampshire city.
But they saved their enthusiasm for more temporal concerns, like his attacks on the Bush administration and his promises to promote equality, education and health care.
''Living in a time of terrorism is not an excuse for failing to live up to our ideals as Americans,'' General Clark said.
He said the Bush administration had fostered a climate of fear ''to distort America's priorities abroad and stifle dissent at home.''
