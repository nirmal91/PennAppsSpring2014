Re ''New Year in Long Beach Is Truly Special'' [Dec. 28]: Long Beach abandoned the mayor/council form of government at the end of World War II in place of a city manager/council. The change was proposed by a well-meaning Citizens Union that believed it would bring better government. But the new Democratic leader at the time, Philip B. Kohut, soon became more powerful than the city manager and the city council and was the person one had to see for a job, an appointment, a nomination, a contract or a favor. That was a half-century ago.
The Democrats were thrown out in the November election, but under the present system there's nothing to prevent the new Republican leaders from assuming the role of their Democratic predecessors.
Bruce Nyman is right when he says Long Beach should have a mayor. Better a strong mayor elected by a vote of all the people than an autocratic political leader chosen by a handful of committeemen from one party.
