Residents of Springfield Gardens lost power for nearly three hours last night because of an electrical failure that Con Edison said was caused by a fallen power line. The power failure affected about 1,300 customers, according to Martha Liipfert, a Con Edison spokeswoman. The electricity went out around 8 p.m. in an area bounded by 131st and 147th Avenues and 181st and 225th Streets. It was restored at 10:45 p.m., Ms. Liipfert said. Norma Bracken, a resident of the area who emigrated from Venezuela 14 years ago, said power outages were common in her home country. ''Sometimes, these kind of things happen,'' she said.
