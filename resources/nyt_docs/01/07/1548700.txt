You probably could not find a ''nanwich'' or a ''nanini'' on the streets of New Delhi, but you can in Greenwich Village, now that the Indian Bread Company, a sliver of a shop and cafe at 194 Bleecker Street (Avenue of the Americas), is making creative use of nan, the traditional Indian flatbread. The bread is baked in a tandoor in the back. Nanwiches have fillings like chicken or paneer (Indian fresh cheese). A nanini (right tray above, held by Nandini Mukherjee, an owner), pressed on a panini grill, can be stuffed with spiced lamb, mozzarella and honey mustard. The shop's stuffed parathas are like quesadillas, and the kathi roll (left tray) is essentially a wrap, but a delicious one, especially with forcefully seasoned potatoes. Filled breads are $2.50 to $5.95, to eat in or take out.
