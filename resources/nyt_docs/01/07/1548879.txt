The president of the police officers' union and the widow of a slain police officer began a letter-writing campaign yesterday to oppose parole for two former Black Panthers convicted of killing two police officers in 1971. One former Panther, Herman Bell, 55, comes up for parole for the first time in February, and the second, Anthony Bottom, 52, will be considered for the second time in July. The two men each have several disciplinary infractions since the late 1980's, but the parole board noted that Mr. Bottom had earned a degree and certificates for ''good works'' while serving time. The union president, Patrick J. Lynch, and Diane Piagentini, the widow of Joseph Piagentini, said they had collected 5,000 signatures to present to the parole board. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, above, also released a letter opposing parole for the two men, while City Councilman Charles Barron said the decision should be based on their behavior in prison, not on the nature of their crime.
