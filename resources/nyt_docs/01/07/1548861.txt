The Federal Communications Commission approved a record $5.4 million fine against a California company for illegally faxing unsolicited advertisements. The commission said the Orange County-based company, Fax.com, violated federal rules for such advertisements 489 times, incurring a fine of $11,000 for each violation. The chairman of the commission, Michael K. Powell, said it was seeking to send a message to the senders of unsolicited faxes: ''Violate our rules and you will pay the consequences.'' Fax.com has said the restrictions violate its First Amendment rights. Officials did not return phone calls.
