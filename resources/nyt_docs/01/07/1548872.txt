Canadian soft drink manufacturers, including the local units of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, said they would withdraw carbonated drinks from vending machines at elementary and junior high schools in the country by the start of the next school year. The move follows pressure from politicians, educators and parents seeking healthier food choices for children. Half the beverages stocked in the schools will be water and pure fruit juice, while noncarbonated juice and sports drinks will make up the rest. High school students will still be able to buy carbonated soft drinks.
