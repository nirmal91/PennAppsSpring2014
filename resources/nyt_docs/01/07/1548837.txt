An article on Monday about firehouse culture in New York City referred incorrectly in some copies to the source of the comment ''If a guy comes in and he doesn't do the right thing, that's where some of the needling comes in. Hopefully, he'll get the idea and set things right'' and ''If you got a problem, all you need to do is mention it at the dinner table. You get all the advice you need. It's firehouse therapy.'' The speaker was a firefighter in Jackson Heights, Queens, not from Astoria.
