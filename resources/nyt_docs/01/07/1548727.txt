To the Editor:
Re ''Who's Nader Now?,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 2):
Democrats seek a presidential candidate who shares their views.
Survey data from the National Election Studies show that, in 2000, most Democrats thought that Democratic representatives in the House were closer to them in ideological terms than Republican representatives were, but that changed in 2002.
In 2002, most Democrats who were represented in the House by a Republican thought that their representative was far away ideologically, but remarkably, most Democrats who had a Democratic representative evaluated that representative as being no less distant.
No wonder Democrats are rallying to the candidate many think will stand up for the ''Democratic wing of the Democratic party.''
