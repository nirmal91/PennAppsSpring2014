Roscoff, on the coast of Brittany in western France, has just the right kind of soil and climate for growing onions. The specialty is a pinkish onion called Rosé de Roscoff, and it deserves to be the center of attention. It is a mild onion with a mellow pungency. The French like these onions raw on open-face sandwiches. Chopped, they can top a salad or a canapé. They are also good to marinate in an escabeche, to use in onion soup or to sauté gently and fold into an omelet. The onions hold up well and do not sprout readily in a warm apartment. A 2.2-pound mesh bag is $4.89 at Fairway markets, where the onions are also sold loose for $2.99 a pound. A box of three onions weighing just under a pound is $2.99 at Agata &amp; Valentina and $5 at Dean &amp; DeLuca stores.
