To the Editor:
Re ''The Era of Distortion,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 6):
Unfortunately, most of us see things as we want to see them, conveniently ignoring troublesome facts that contradict our points of view. It is part of the human condition to find ambiguity unsettling.
Fundamentalist religions are popular because people crave the comfort of certainty. The truly objective person, at ease with shades of gray and willing to be proved wrong, is a brave person and a rare one.
