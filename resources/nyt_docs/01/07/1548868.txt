Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts attacked a proposed Labor Department rule advising employers how to avoid paying overtime. ''When will the Bush administration devise a how-to plan to put people back to work, a how-to plan to create jobs, or a how-to plan to save manufacturing jobs?'' he said in a statement. In Ames, Iowa, he added: ''They're putting out a guideline to employers for the ways in which those employers can actually avoid their responsibility to workers, even as they're prepared to give people earning more than $200,000 a year yet another tax cut. We don't have a broken budget in the United States of America, we've got a broken set of values at the head of our government, and we need to stand up and undo it.''
