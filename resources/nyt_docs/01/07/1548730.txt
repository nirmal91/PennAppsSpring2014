Pakistan on Tuesday denied a report in The New York Times that Libya had obtained a design for enriching uranium from Pakistani scientists, The Associated Press reported.
''This is total madness,'' Information Minister Sheik Rashid Ahmed told the agency. ''The report is absolutely false, and there is no truth in it.''
Asked Tuesday about the report, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said: ''I don't have enough information at hand to answer a question quite as specific as that. We know that there have been cases where individuals in Pakistan have worked in these areas and we have called it to the attention of the Pakistanis in the past.''
