To the Editor:
David Brooks jokes about the term neocon, saying that ''con is short for 'conservative' and neo is short for 'Jewish' '' (column, Jan. 6). Although I am well aware of a subset of crazies who correlate neoconservatives with Jews because of anti-Semitic feelings, anyone who reads the newspaper can see that there is a powerful group of ''new'' conservatives in the present administration.
