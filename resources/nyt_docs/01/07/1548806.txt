To the Editor:
It is wonderful that New York City is finally recognizing the problem of school violence, but the new draconian policy (front page, Jan. 6) is disturbingly reactive and misguided.
The root cause of violence in the schools has always been the city's neglect of low-income students. School-age kids are impressionable and respond directly to their environment, and an unsupervised, underfinanced, overcrowded system is a breeding ground for bullying and violence.
We need more teachers, more books, better role models and more people caring about students and nurturing their development, not a system that neglects and stigmatizes those most in need of guidance and support.
Spending money on the police because we didn't first spend the money to give kids the time and devotion they so badly need sells our kids short and bodes ill for the future of our society as a whole.
