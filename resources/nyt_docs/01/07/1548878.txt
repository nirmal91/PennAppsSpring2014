Charles L. Singleton, a schizophrenic whose case tested the nation's standard for executing the mentally ill, was put to death by lethal injection even as another death row inmate won a stay. Mr. Singleton, 44, drew national attention because his sanity depended on antipsychotic drugs. Convicted of the murder of a grocer in a robbery in 1979, Mr. Singleton deteriorated steadily in prison until officials began to medicate him, often against his will. A federal appeals court panel reduced his sentence to life. The death sentence was reinstated by the full court when the state appealed; and the Supreme Court declined to review the case last month. The execution of Karl D. Roberts, 35, convicted of murdering his 12-year-old niece in 1999, was stayed. Mr. Roberts had expressed a desire to be executed until yesterday, and a federal district judge granted a stay to allow his lawyers time to study a possible appeal. When the state appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the stay. Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court, who oversees the circuit, also upheld it.
