Now we know what it takes to coax a confession of sorts from the long-defiant Pete Rose, who was banned from Major League Baseball 14 years ago for betting on games and has protested his innocence ever since. Just give him a large advance payment for a confessional autobiography that is designed to persuade the baseball commissioner to lift the ban, thereby allowing Mr. Rose to pursue a job as baseball manager and take his last best shot at election to baseball's Hall of Fame.
The publisher is promoting the new autobiography as ''a story of redemption,'' but there is not a lot of redemption visible here. Mr. Rose admits that he bet heavily on sports and even on his own team when he was managing the Cincinnati Reds, but he claims that he never bet against his team, never took advantage of inside information and never based his managerial decisions on how he had bet. How much credence to put in those assertions from an admitted liar is problematic. Already some of his assertions are being disputed by former colleagues. Nor does Mr. Rose show much contrition, explaining that he is ''just not built that way.''
We hope Commissioner Bud Selig resists the temptation to play to the gallery of die-hard Rose fans and lets the banishment stand. Mr. Rose is hardly the kind of man one wants in a leadership position over impressionable young players. His gambling addiction and lack of contrition make it likely that he would repeat his offenses. Pardoning him now would remove the deterrent effect of a baseball rule that clearly calls for a lifetime ban for betting on your own team.
Whether he should be in the Hall of Fame is a separate issue. As the all-time leader in career hits, Mr. Rose deserves admission for his achievements as a player, perhaps with an asterisk noting his banishment for wagering as a manager.
