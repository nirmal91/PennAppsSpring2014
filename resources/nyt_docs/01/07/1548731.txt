Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York asked the White House on Tuesday to require staff members to disclose any confidential conversations with reporters that might help determine whether an administration official improperly divulged the name of a C.I.A. undercover officer.
The senator made the request in a letter to President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. The White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, responded to it, telling reporters: ''This is an investigation being conducted by career officials at the Department of Justice. And it would be unfortunate if people are seeking to politicize a serious matter like leaking classified information for partisan gain.''
Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, in a meeting on Tuesday with editors and reporters in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, denied that his request was politically motivated. ''I think they should get to the bottom of it because it's a horrible thing that was done,'' he said.
In his letter, he said that White House employees had only ''partially cooperated'' with Justice Department investigators. Last month, investigators asked some White House employees to sign a waiver giving up claims of privacy in conversations with reporters -- a step that could allow investigators to determine more easily who provided the name of Valerie Plame, the C.I.A. officer.
