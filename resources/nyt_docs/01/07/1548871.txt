A contingent of baseball officials will visit Monterrey, Mexico, today to consider that city's candidacy for permanent relocation of the Montreal Expos, who are owned by Major League Baseball.
Members of the relocation committee, including the owner of the Texas Rangers, Tom Hicks, and two baseball officials, will also tour three other cities before owners meet in Scottsdale, Ariz., next Wednesday and Thursday. Bob DuPuy, baseball's president and a member of its relocation committee, said in a telephone interview yesterday that he hoped to be close to a decision on the Expos within 90 days.
