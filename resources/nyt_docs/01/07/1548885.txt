The American Civil Liberties Union and several minority rights advocates filed suit yesterday, seeking to overturn a New Jersey law that prohibits convicted felons from voting after they have left prison and are serving terms of parole or probation. ''The purpose of the lawsuit is to expand democracy and expand voting rights,'' said Prof. Frank Askin, director of the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic and one of the lawyers who prepared the suit. ''Public policy favors reintegrating ex-offenders into society, including making them full participants in civic life. We don't believe the state has any justification in denying these people the right to vote.'' The suit contends that denial of voting rights to those on probation or parole violates the New Jersey Constitution's provisions guaranteeing equal protection under the law.
