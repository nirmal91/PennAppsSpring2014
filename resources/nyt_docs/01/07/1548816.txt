To the Editor:
Re ''The Era of Distortion,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 6):
I fully support Mr. Brooks's right to take liberals to task for whatever he disagrees with them about; we liberals are recently discovering we have the right to do the same. But to equate criticism of ''neocons'' with anti-Semitism is not only a weak attempt to deflect genuine criticism of the hawks in President Bush's administration, but it is also a deeply cynical way to attempt to cut off debate. For example, ''if you criticize this president or his advisers, you're anti-Semitic.''
You could also easily replace ''anti-Semitic'' with ''unpatriotic'' or ''anti-family,'' as we've heard from Republicans in the last few years.
I adhere to the theory that a group of hawks or neocons has hijacked this nation's foreign policy. But the religion of the advisers in question is not, and should not, be a part of the argument. It is Mr. Brooks who has inserted religion into the debate.
