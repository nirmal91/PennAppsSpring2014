To the Editor:
One of my most vivid recollections of growing up in the Bronx in the 1950's was the weekly walk to Jerome Avenue with my father on Saturday evenings to pick up fresh hot bagels from the bagel bakery in the cellar under the cigar store under the el. They were baked in brick ovens exactly as you described, and they were incomparable.
When I've shared that memory with others who knew the neighborhood, they remember the place -- and the taste -- in just the same way.
