To the Editor:
I would like to set the record straight regarding ''In Sutton Place's Backyard, Private Oasis on Public Land'' (front page, Dec. 31).
While I was parks commissioner (1990-1993), my agency never had control of the land behind 1 Sutton Place.
However, I believed that with control, which I requested, a compromise benefiting the public could have been negotiated. In the same memo quoted in the article, I stated that 1 Sutton Place co-op owners should make a substantial contribution toward the maintenance and security of all five waterfront parks. All of these heavily used parks were in need of restoration that the city could not afford in 1993.
The property was transferred to the Parks Department only after I was no longer commissioner.
The implication that favoritism influenced me is outrageous and insulting. Furthermore, George Gould, the current chairman of the board at 1 Sutton Place, had no association with the building at the time.
