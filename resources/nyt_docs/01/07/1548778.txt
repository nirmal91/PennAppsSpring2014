The principal who invited the police into a Goose Creek, S.C., high school on Nov. 5 for a drug raid that included drawn guns and a drug-sniffing dog has resigned.
In a statement released by the Berkeley County School District, the principal, George McCrackin, said he ''realized it is in the best interest of Stratford High School and of my students for me to make a change.''
The early morning raid, which yielded no drugs, led to accusations of excessive force and racism and has led to two federal lawsuits by students asserting that the police action violated their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The school is mostly white, but two-thirds of the 107 students caught up in the raid are black.
The raid was conducted early in the morning, when most of those at the school were black students who had arrived on the early bus. School officials said they had conducted it at that time not as a matter of racial discrimination but because they believed that drug-dealing was taking place then. The police said their tactics were an appropriate precaution, in case they found drug-dealing and violence at the school.
Videotape of the raid, taken from the school's surveillance cameras, showed police officers pointing guns at students' heads, and other students forced to kneel, face a wall or lie on the floor, while the dog sniffed them. As these scenes were repeatedly shown on local and national television, the public outcry rose.
The head of the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. called for Mr. McCrackin's firing, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson led protests over the raid. There have also been demonstrations in support of Mr. McCrackin by many faculty members, letters to the editor and banners and posters hung in the school.
Mr. McCrackin said on Monday that the continued pressure and distraction arising from the raid had made it too difficult to lead the school effectively. At his request, he will be reassigned within the district.
