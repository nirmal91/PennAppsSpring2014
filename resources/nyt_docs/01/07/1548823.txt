To the Editor:
As someone who served as a co-Klappermeister from 1990 to 1991, it would sadden me to see the Lowell House bells returned to Russia (''For Whom Will Harvard's Bells Toll? That's in Question,'' Moscow Journal, Jan. 5).
The bells have long been a Harvard tradition, and not simply because we ring them at particular occasions. The bells also come with their stories, which Klappermeisters have shared over the years.
During the time I helped ring the bells, we also acted as host to famous visitors, like Harold Edgerton, the inventor of strobe light photography, who came to photograph the bells shortly before he died. And on Halloween night, when we rang the Bell of Mother Earth 13 times to ward off evil spirits, we established a new tradition of having a procession of costumed students climb the tower to experience the events firsthand.
To me, a proper solution would be for the Danilov Monastery to cast new bells for itself, and leave the old bells in the good hands they have been in for almost a century.
