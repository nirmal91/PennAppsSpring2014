Prosecutors charged a current and a former executive of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York yesterday with conspiring to defraud the government by overbilling the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for work on its ad account.
The executives, Thomas Early and Shona Seifert, were charged by the United States attorney's office in New York with falsifying time sheets and other documents to overbill the drug office from May 1999 through April 2000.
Ms. Seifert, who left Ogilvy in January 2002 to become president at the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, said in a statement that she was innocent and planned to contest the charges. Mr. Early could not be reached yesterday; his assistant said he was not available and referred calls to the agency.
A statement issued by Ogilvy, part of the WPP Group, said, ''We are aware that several individuals have been charged in connection with actions that are alleged to have been taken while they worked on the initial O.N.D.C.P. contract,'' which the agency was first awarded in 1998.
''If true, their behavior was inconsistent with the high standards the company promotes and maintains,'' the statement said.
In the years described in the indictment, Mr. Early was senior partner and director for finance at Ogilvy; Ms. Seifert was senior partner and executive group director, serving at times as project director and co-project director on the account.
In February 2002, Ogilvy paid $1.8 million to settle charges of overbilling the drug office, which paved the way for the agency to continue handling the account despite efforts by some Republicans in Congress to bar Ogilvy from doing so. The settlement did not affect the criminal investigation into the agency's employees, which led to the indictments.
