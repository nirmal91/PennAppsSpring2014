Two French citizens were killed Tuesday in Iraq, the French Foreign Ministry said. They were first from this country to die as a result of the American-led war that France has vehemently opposed.
The two, who have not been identified, were apparently shot late Monday on a highway west of Baghdad after their vehicle broke down. Another French citizen traveling with them was reportedly wounded.
The Foreign Ministry said those killed were working in Iraq for an American company without the knowledge of the French government. It did not identify the company but cautioned other French citizens to register with the French government if they travel to Iraq.
''These tragic facts lead us to repeat, as is stated under 'travel warnings' on the ministry's Internet site, that it is absolutely imperative for all French expatriates who find themselves in Iraq to make themselves known to our consular authorities and the French Interests Section in Baghdad,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Herv√© Ladsous.
According to reports from the United States military, the French nationals were traveling in a convoy of at least two sport utility vehicles when one of the vehicles broke down about noon, eight miles east of the restive town of Falluja. While trying to repair the broken-down vehicle, they were shot at from a passing car.
''They were basically gunned down by some terrorists,'' Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, told reporters, according to Agence France-Presse.
French citizens overwhelmingly opposed the war, and the French government lobbied hard to delay its outset in the weeks before the invasion began.
France has so far refused American requests for troops to help stabilize the country. As a result, the United States has barred French companies from playing a leading role in the country's reconstruction, though they may take part as subcontractors.
