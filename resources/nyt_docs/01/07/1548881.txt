City Council Speaker Gifford Miller has hired a private firm to investigate accusations of sexual harassment made against Councilman Allan W. Jennings Jr., of Queens, by two of his former aides. The firm, ADR Associates/JAMS will interview those involved in the case, and recommend how to address sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. Mr. Jennings has denied the accusations. The Council's Standards and Ethics Committee has also asked the city's Department of Investigations to review the matter. Council officials have said the speaker was told of rumors of a sexual harassment complaint in June, but did not learn that it concerned Mr. Jennings until the councilman's aides filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in December.
