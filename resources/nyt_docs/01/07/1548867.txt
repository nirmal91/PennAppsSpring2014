While Democrats are getting all the attention in Iowa, Republicans will hold caucuses on Jan. 19 as well, though there is no fight over the Republican presidential nomination. But that does not mean Republicans might not try to steal some Democratic thunder. Ted Sporer, the Republican chairman for Polk County, said on Tuesday that he expected there would be ''high-level'' representatives of the Bush team on hand on caucus night to celebrate what is expected to be President Bush's victory by acclamation.
''I would anticipate some surprises in store,'' he said.
