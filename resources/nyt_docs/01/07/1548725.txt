To the Editor:
Was the helmsman asleep at the tiller? In ''The New Queen'' (editorial, Jan. 6), you commit not one but two nautical solecisms.
The Queen Mary 2 may steam at a brisk 30 knots, but not knots per hour. Knots in this context means nautical miles per hour. (Thirty knots is almost 35 statute miles per hour.) And the only thing a ship weighs is its anchor. What the Queen Mary 2 does is displace 150,000 tons.
