To the Editor:
Mark Bittman's article on jook (''The Minimalist: From China, Hangover Help,'' Dec. 31) struck home with our family this holiday season. For generations, the Fongs and Chins made jook after Thanksgiving and Christmas with the turkey carcass.
I believe that ours is a great metaphor for our life; a perfect blend of American and Cantonese culture. By the way, Grandpa George Fong used to serve his with minced scallions, roasted peanuts and Fritos.
