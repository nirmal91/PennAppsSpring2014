In the advertising wars, both Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut released new spots on Tuesday.
Mr. Gephardt started a television commercial in Iowa, focusing on his record of opposing trade deals with Mexico and China, which have been blamed for severe job losses. Mr. Lieberman released two spots in New Hampshire, intensifying his effort to prove himself the uniquely moderate and electable alternative to President Bush and Howard Dean.
Mr. Gephardt's advisers hope his spot will blunt support for Dr. Dean. The advertisement emphasizes that Mr. Gephardt is the only Democratic candidate who voted against the two trade deals in Congress, which Dr. Dean supported in the 1990's.
A 60-second Lieberman radio spot recounts newspaper reports that Mr. Bush told the prime minister of Australia that he thought Mr. Lieberman would be his toughest opponent. The announcer points out that the president did not name Dr. Dean.
Campaign advisers have not directly confirmed the statement with the White House, and Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary, Terry Holt, said he did not ''have any information on any private conversations that may or may not have taken place.''
