To the Editor:
Re ''Mad Cow Forces Beef Industry to Change Course'' (front page, Jan. 5):
Was it really too much to expect the beef industry to exclude sick, non-ambulatory cows from our food supply a long time ago, before the government forced it to do that?
The industry's greed has killed the goose that laid the golden egg. I may never enjoy a hamburger again.
