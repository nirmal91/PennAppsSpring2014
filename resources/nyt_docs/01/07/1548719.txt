LITERATURE: WHITBREAD AWARD WINNERS -- A story narrated by a youth won the Whitbread prize yesterday for novel of the year. The book is ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,'' by Mark Haddon, left. Told by a 15-year-old boy detective afflicted with a form of autism, it was acclaimed by the judges in London as a work with resonance for adults as well as adolescents, Reuters reported. The novel of the year is one of five categories of the Whitbread awards in Britain. The winners in each category compete for the $45,550 Whitbread Book of the Year award, to be announced on Jan. 27. Besides Mr. Haddon, the winners in the other categories include the Booker Prize winner, DBC Pierre, who took the Whitbread first novel award for ''Vernon God Little,'' about a Texas teenager and a high school massacre. D. J. Taylor's ''Orwell: The Life,'' won the biography award; Don Patterson's ''Landing Light'' won the poetry prize, and the children's book award went to ''The Fire-Eaters,'' David Almond's story of a boy growing up in a seaside community in northern England at the time of the Cuban missile crisis.
PIANO MUSEUM CLOSES -- Unable to pay its rent, the Museum of the American Piano at 291 Broadway in Lower Manhattan, has closed its doors. Kalman Detrich, its founder and director, said he had received some offers of space since an article about the impending closing of the 20-year-old museum appeared in The New York Times on Christmas Day. ''We're chasing each other on answering machines,'' he said. The antique pianos are to be dispersed to temporary homes and storage, and the museum's Web site, www.museumforpianos.org, remains in operation while Mr. Detrich tries to find another location.
BOBBY HATFIELD: AUTOPSY FINDING -- Bobby Hatfield, left, of the pop-soul duo the Righteous Brothers did not die of coronary disease after all. The official autopsy report says that Mr. Hatfield, 63, fell victim to acute cocaine intoxication when he died in his hotel room in Kalamazoo, Mich., on Nov. 5 just hours before a concert, The Associated Press reported. The news agency, citing The Kalamazoo Gazette, said the determination was made by Dr. Richard Tooker, the chief medical examiner for Kalamazoo County. Mr. Hatfield, a passionate tenor, and his partner, Bill Medley, had hits like ''Unchained Melody'' and ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' .''
