To the Editor:
You report (front page, Jan. 6) that 150 police officers will be brought in to help with order in 12 of the most violent schools in New York City.
You then report that officials cautioned against labeling the 12 schools the city's most dangerous.
If they are not the most dangerous, which schools are, and why aren't police officers being sent there? And if they are the most dangerous, why the spin?
Is there something about acknowledging the existence of dangerous schools that some people find offensive?
Perhaps those officials are simply taking advice from Mark Twain, when he said: ''Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it.''
