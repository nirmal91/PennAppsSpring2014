''The Vegan Guide to New York City,'' by Rynn Berry and Chris Abreu-Suzuki (Ethical Living $9.95), is not only for vegans, who eat no animal products. Borough by borough, the book lists restaurants that are vegetarian, those that are macrobiotic and might serve fish, and others that are merely ''vegetarian friendly,'' meaning that diners who don't eat meat will find something appealing on the menu. Lists of places that serve raw food, health food stores, mail-order sources, bookstores, Web sites and even shops that sell ''cruelty free shoes'' are packed into the guide's 70 pages, which also contain advertising.
