Russia's central bank plans to introduce new ruble bank notes in the second half of the year to combat counterfeiting. The central bank also plans to issue a 5,000 ruble note next year, in addition to existing 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 ruble notes. ''The new notes will circulate in addition to existing ones, there won't be any swap,'' Arnold Voilukov, the first deputy chairman at the bank, said. ''The old notes will be accepted any time and will be in circulation until worn out.'' Roughly 1.2 trillion rubles, or $41 billion, are in circulation in Russia, and the central bank estimates that about 100 million of the rubles in circulation are forged.
