To the Editor:
''Was Life Better When Bagels Were Smaller?'' (Dec. 31) ignored one important and essential fact that makes our city's bagels worth their salt: New York City water. As purveyor of the city's water supply system, the Department of Environmental Protection has had various requests to deliver our source waters to bagel makers across the country. Once, we carted city water to a bagel maker in a Smithsonian Institution exhibition in Washington. Yeast is yeast and dough is dough, but bagels need our H20.
