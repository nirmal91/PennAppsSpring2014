Meeting in Dublin as the presidency of the European Union rotated to Ireland and to Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, Mr. Ahern, at right, and Romano Prodi of Italy, left, president of the other main branch of the union's government, the European Commission, addressed their clashing views about future negotiations for a new constitution. ''We cannot wait forever,'' Mr. Prodi said at a news conference, sitting next to Mr. Ahern. ''Europe cannot always go at the speed of the very, very slowest wagon.'' Mr. Prodi said that failure to agree on a constitution quickly would result in a ''two-speed'' Europe. Mr. Ahern said new talks must include all members, including 10 new nations set to join in May.
