An article on Dec. 30 about Gen. Wesley K. Clark's support of voting rights in his campaign for the presidential nomination misstated the number of states that have eased barriers to voting by felons who have served their sentences. It is nine, not seven. The article also referred incompletely to Alabama's consideration of such a measure. Although Gov. Bob Riley vetoed it last June, he signed a similar bill three months later.
