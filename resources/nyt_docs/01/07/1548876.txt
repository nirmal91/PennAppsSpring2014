A new law authorizing licensed civilians to carry concealed handguns does not violate the state's Constitution, the state Supreme Court ruled, rejecting a challenge by a doctor and a children's advocacy group. The decision will allow the Department of Public Safety to begin issuing permits this month. The law requires that those seeking to carry a handgun be at least 25 years old, pass a criminal background check and complete firearms training.
