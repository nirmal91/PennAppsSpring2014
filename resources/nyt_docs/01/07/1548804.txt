To the Editor:
''Police to Guard 12 City Schools Cited as Violent'' (front page, Jan. 6) appears to indicate that a lesser degree of violence is tolerated in other New York City middle and high schools, including assaults against teachers.
The mayor said that from now on, students who seriously injure others or are caught with weapons will be removed immediately. Is there a benchmark for how serious an injury against a staff member must be before students are removed?
It might be helpful for teachers to know how much physical harm they must endure to reach the passing grade of ''serious.''
