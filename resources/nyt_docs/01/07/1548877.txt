After a long dispute between Mayor Shirley Franklin of Atlanta and a majority of the City Council, the Council passed a sewer rate increase to finance a $3.2 billion overhaul of the city water and sewer system. Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. of Federal District Court had threatened a moratorium on sewer hookups in the city if it did not update the system, which in heavy rains dumps sewage into the Chattahoochee River and backs up in poor neighborhoods.
