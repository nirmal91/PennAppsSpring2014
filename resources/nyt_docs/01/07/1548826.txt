First there was the thick foreign accent that did not sound anything like North Carolina. Then there were the startling lapses in memory: the man could not name his own brothers and sisters.
In the end, it was a story that did not hold water, and a fraud that collapsed into calamity.
The man, who was tried before a federal judge in Manhattan on Monday, remains known to the authorities only as ''John Doe.'' His trial before Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of Federal District Court lasted less than a hour, and he was convicted of making false statements on passport applications.
Federal prosecutors said yesterday that Mr. Doe showed up on Aug. 7, 2002, at the New York Passport Office, seeking a passport under the name of another man. He had a birth certificate, library card and employment identification, all in the name of the other man, whom the authorities would not identify.
Immigration officials said Mr. Doe claimed to be a native of North Carolina. That seemed doubtful, both because his accent indicated he might be from the Caribbean, and because of his pitiful lack of knowledge about what he said was his home state.
In questioning by agents for the Diplomatic Security Service, a branch of the State Department, Mr. Doe said he had several brothers and sisters, but did not recall how many. Nor could he name any of them.
Another man, who participated in the ruse by signing a passport application on Mr. Doe's behalf, and later agreed to testify, described Mr. Doe as an illegal immigrant from Jamaica who wanted a passport so he could travel freely between the United States and his homeland.
Mr. Doe has been held since his arrest on Aug. 7, 2002, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and was returned there after his conviction on Monday. He is to be sentenced by Judge Duffy on Feb. 23, and faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
