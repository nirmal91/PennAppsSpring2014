An East Orange police detective was indicted yesterday on charges that he overcharged the city more than $100,000 for computer supplies bought from fake corporations created by his family and friends. The detective, Norman Price, 45, of Bedminster, is charged with official misconduct and other offenses. Prosecutors said he was part of a scheme that began shortly after he was assigned in 2001 to help choose vendors to upgrade the Police Department's communications and computer equipment. Prosecutors said that Mr. Price's wife, Natasha McRae, 35, and a family friend, Vaughn Miller, 41, of North Plainfield, bought items like office furniture and computer software from legitimate businesses and resold them to the department through fake corporations at inflated prices. Ms. McRae and Mr. Miller were also charged in the indictment.
