Mochi ice cream is to Hawaii what egg creams are to New York. It is made by wrapping a paste of sweet glutinous rice around a ball of ice cream. Bubbies Homemade Ice Cream, a Honolulu company that was started by Keith Robbins, a New Yorker, is selling mochi ice cream online and at Grace's Marketplace. Bubbies has a relatively delicate coating, in bright colors. The ice cream is good quality, too. The portions are an ounce and a quarter and come in more than 16 flavors, including litchi, green tea, tiramis√π, strawberry and chocolate-coconut. A box of eight is $8.99 at Grace's or $43, with shipping, from www.bubbiesicecream.com. Larger assortments are also available.
