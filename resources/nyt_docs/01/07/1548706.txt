An article last Wednesday about traditional bagels in New York City misidentified the Queens neighborhood for one supplier, Hot Bialys. It is Forest Hills, as noted in the listing with the article, not Jamaica.
The article also misstated the ingredient used by Murray's Bagels in Manhattan to sweeten its dough. While the bagels do contain sugar, the store in fact also adds malt.
