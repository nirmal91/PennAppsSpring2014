To the Editor:
It's a shame that David Brooks equates those who may take issue with his so-called cabal of neocons with anti-Semites (column, Jan. 6). Writing that ''neo'' means Jewish is offensive.
Many of those who would stand up for Israel and its policies are Jewish, and just as many are not. But those of us who have no anti-Semitic feelings should still feel free to criticize Israel and the kind of thinking here in the United States that supports Ariel Sharon, settlements, heavy military aid to Israel and the denial of basic rights to Palestinians, among other things.
Just because I am concerned about John Ashcroft's campaign to erode my civil liberties does not mean I am anti-Christian.
I resent being implicitly labeled an anti-Semite because I am frightened about the direction in which Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle might want to take the world.
