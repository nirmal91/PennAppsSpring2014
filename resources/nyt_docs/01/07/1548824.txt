To the Editor:
As an undergraduate resident of Lowell House in the early 1960's and a member of the Society of Russian Bell Ringers (as the Klappermeisters were then called), I wish to assure Heirodeacon Roman and the other monks of the Danilov Monastery (Moscow Journal, Jan. 5) that I and other bell ringers did indeed pray as we joyfully rang the bells.
I prayed that the people of Russia would be permitted to practice their religious faith, and I rejoice that those prayers have been answered.
As a Harvard alumnus (1964), I urge the university to return these great bells to their original religious setting. I look forward to visiting them at Danilov.
