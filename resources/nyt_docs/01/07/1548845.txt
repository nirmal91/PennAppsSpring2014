The cover article in the Television section on Dec. 28, about ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show,'' quoted a dialogue passage incorrectly from a November episode. Ms. DeGeneres asked Robert Downey Jr. what he was thankful for on Thanksgiving, not what his plans were. To which he replied: ''Oh, so much. Let's see. I'll be going to Palm Springs and I won't be getting arrested while I'm there.'' -- not ''and getting arrested.''
