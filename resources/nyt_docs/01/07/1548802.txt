To the Editor:
Re ''Police to Guard 12 City Schools Cited as Violent'' (front page, Jan. 6):
I taught in a Brooklyn public school and experienced firsthand the daily disruptions by troubled students. Aside from the obvious problems facing public schools in New York City, school administrators' systematic denial and concealment of incidents is perhaps as serious a problem.
In an attempt to present their schools as safe, and therefore promote themselves as successful, some principals rarely suspend students or ''unofficially'' suspend students (by asking parents to keep their children home) so that their disruptions are not reported to the district.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's initiatives will never benefit these schools.
As frightening as it is that some schools need to take these measures, I feel worse for my former colleagues who are unprotected and work in buildings where the administrators value their reputations more than the safety of their staff and students.
