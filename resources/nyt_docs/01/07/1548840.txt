An article in Business Day yesterday about automakers' plans for more hybrid vehicles misidentified one model that Honda will start selling this year. It is an Accord, not an Acura. Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly to a forecast from the Toyota Motor Company. The figure of two million sold by the end of the decade was for Toyota models only, not those of all automakers.
