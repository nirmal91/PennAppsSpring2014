A New York City schoolteacher was arrested in Westchester County after he had sexually explicit conversations on the Internet with a detective posing as a teenage girl, the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, said yesterday. The teacher, Joseph Bovino, 54, of Baldwin Place, N.Y., had taught social studies at a special high school for students in their late teens and early 20's and has been on leave since November 2002 because of an injury, a school spokeswoman said. Mr. Bovino was charged with attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor, a felony that carries a jail term of up to four years.
