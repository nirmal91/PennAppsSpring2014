To the Editor:
Re ''An Operation to Ease Back Pain Bolsters the Bottom Line, Too'' (''Re-examining Medicare'' series, front page, Dec. 31): I differ with the view that laminectomy is done for back pain. Laminectomy is almost always for the radicular pain known as sciatica, pain radiating down one or both extremities at rest and/or after walking for a distance.
I do agree, however, that as opposed to laminectomy for sciatica, instrumentation and fusion have a very tenuous claim to effectiveness. Most back pain will go away within a year of onset, and even most sciatica recedes with conservative measures.
Also mentioned was that Medicare encourages new procedures. Perhaps it does for spinal surgery, but newer cranial procedures are underfinanced.
