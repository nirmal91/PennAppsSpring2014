To the Editor:
Re ''The Other Doctor in Dean's House Shuns Politics'' (front page, Jan. 13):
Three cheers for Dr. Judith Steinberg Dean! She represents the thousands of women today who are dedicated to their professional careers and are secure in the knowledge that their value does not depend on their identity as somebody's wife.
And three cheers for those husbands who support their wives!
Independent wives of American presidents, like Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Rodham Clinton, are viciously attacked, while those who gaze adoringly at their husbands during endless campaign speeches are sanctified as role models for the perfect wife.
The world has changed, and women are making many choices now. Let's celebrate them!
