Ted Cottrell accepted an offer to become Minnesota's defensive coordinator yesterday, two weeks after he was fired from that post by the Jets.
Jets Coach Herman Edwards pointed to the defense's lack of improvement over three years, but Cottrell said he was made the scapegoat for an aging, injury-riddled unit. The defense ranked 21st in yards allowed a game, but it gave up only 18.7 points a game, eighth in the league.
Cottrell said the timing of his firing diminished his chances of being interviewed for a head coaching job. He said he was excited about Minnesota's young defense, and he noted that the Vikings' offense could score plenty of points, a luxury the Jets' defense did not always enjoy. (The Jets' offense ranked 23rd with 17.7 points a game.)
''It hurt my chances when all that negative stuff started, of staying hot for a head coaching job,'' Cottrell said. ''That knocked me out of the box. But the defensive coordinator reputation, the past work, really helped. ''Hopefully, if we do well, my name will get back up on the short list.''
Cottrell replaced George O'Leary, who left to become the coach at Central Florida. The Jets, continuing their search for Cottrell's replacement, will interview Tennessee's linebackers coach, Gunther Cunningham, today.
