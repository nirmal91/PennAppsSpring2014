To the Editor:
There is a very odd trend I've noticed in the New York City restaurant world.
A lot of new restaurants are opening, and it's becoming increasingly mind-numbing to keep track of them all. What is not helping the situation is that new restaurant names are often indistinguishable two- to three-syllable foreign-sounding words -- Bivio and Pazo and Kirara, not to mention Pylos, Suba, Sumile and Quhnia.
The restaurateurs then announce the meaning of the name, usually a translation of something having to do with the restaurant or not: ''It means lily in the region of Italy where the chef comes from,'' or ''This space was owned by the owner's grandfather, and he liked to play stickball in the early 20th century, so it means stickball in early-20th-century Russian Yiddish.''
What's at the top of my list of new places to try in New York? That would be Schiller's Liquor Bar, Lucy Mexican Barbecue, Mermaid Inn, Uncle Jack's Steakhouse and yes, even the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. They make it clear who they are and what they do, so it's very easy to remember them.
