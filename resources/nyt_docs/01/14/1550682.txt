An article on Sunday about President Bush's involvement in his re-election efforts referred incorrectly to the current assignment of the political operative Ralph Reed. (The error also appeared in an article on Dec. 20 about grass-roots voting efforts by the Republican Party and in one on Sept. 29 about preparations by the Bush campaign to focus on the eventual Democratic nominee.) Mr. Reed is the Southeast regional chairman for the Bush-Cheney '04 campaign. He resigned as head of the Georgia Republican Party in May 2003 to join the Bush campaign, and was succeeded by Alec Poitevint.
