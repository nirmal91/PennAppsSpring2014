When Giants Coach Tom Coughlin announced the hiring of four assistant coaches yesterday, he made at least one of his players very happy.
Coughlin retained the tight ends coach Mike Pope, who joined Jim Fassel's staff in 2000 and became the mentor that tight end Jeremy Shockey recently called a father figure. As it turns out, Coughlin did not have to think long about Pope, a 21-year N.F.L. assistant who is in his second stint with the Giants. The two were assistants under Bill Parcells in the late 80's.
''He is the best tight ends coach in football,'' Coughlin said.
Pope, 61, has coached five different tight ends to Pro Bowl berths, including Shockey, who has been selected in each of his first two seasons. Shockey will sit out the game next month with a knee injury.
Coughlin also rehired another of Fassel's assistants, the special teams assistant Mike Priefer, who started his N.F.L. coaching career under Coughlin in Jacksonville in 2002.
The other two assistants Coughlin hired worked for him through the eight seasons he coached Jacksonville. Jerald Ingram, the running backs coach, and Jerry Palmieri, the strength and conditioning coach, began working for Coughlin when he was the coach at Boston College, then followed him to the Jaguars.
Coughlin has hired five assistants. His first move was to bring in Tim Lewis as defensive coordinator last Friday, a few days after he was fired by Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Bill Cowher.
