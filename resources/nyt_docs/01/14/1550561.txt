After toying with Japanese influences at Aquavit, MARCUS SAMUELSSON has a bona fide sushi bar run by SHIGENORI TANAKA, below. It is on the ground floor of RIINGO, the restaurant he owns with HAKAN SWAHN, which opens next week in the new Alex Hotel at 205 East 45th Street. The dining room serves contemporary American food with Japanese touches. The executive chef is JOHAN SVENSSON.
DAVID BOULEY, one of the last of the city's top chefs to have resisted the siren-call of far-flung hotel deals, has succumbed. In the fall he is to open a restaurant in the Ritz-Carlton South Beach, in Miami Beach. It will be devoted to food and wine pairings and will have a more informal lounge. The building incorporates a landmark hotel designed in 1953 by Morris Lapidus.
LA CÔTE BASQUE, one of the last bastions of French cuisine, will close in early March. But JEAN-JACQUES RACHOU, the chef and owner, said he planned to reopen the restaurant a couple of months later as L.C.B. BRASSERIE RACHOU. Mr. Rachou said the restaurant would acquire a traditional brasserie décor.
HOWARD NICKEN, who was the manager of Restaurant 222, which Frank Valenza closed last year, has reopened the place as WEST 79 RESTAURANT, 222 West 79th Street.
CARVAO GRILL, a rustic, country-style place designed by ANTONIO FRANCESCO, who is also the chef and owner, has opened at 1477 Second Avenue (77th Street). It fuses South America with Portugal, serving churrasco barbecue from a wood-burning oven, a Portuguese clam pot and dishes like baby octopus in red wine.
PIMENTON has opened on two floors of a brownstone at 21-50 44th Drive in Long Island City, Queens. The chef, JOSÉ BÁRCENA, has created a classic Spanish menu with an array of tapas.
MICHAEL SHERMAN, a chef whose résumé includes Lespinasse, Aureole and Bouley, has opened RIVERDALE GARDEN, 4574 Manhattan College Parkway, in the Bronx. His wife, LISA SHERMAN, who worked in the pastry department at Lespinasse, is his partner. The restaurant has a no-nonsense but contemporary American menu.
