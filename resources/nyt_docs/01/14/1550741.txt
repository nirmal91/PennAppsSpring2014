A Brooklyn teacher was arrested yesterday after he punched an unruly student, the police said. The teacher, identified as Douglas David, 63, of Middle School 136, was charged with third-degree assault. The student, a 12-year-old boy in the sixth grade, was treated at Lutheran Medical Center for a cut over one eye. A police official said that when Mr. David plugged in an overhead projector for a lesson, the student unplugged it twice. Mr. David reprimanded him, the student ''came toward'' Mr. David, and Mr. David punched him, the official said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said that Mr. David, who has taught in city schools since 2001, had been transferred to an office job pending investigation. A teachers' union spokesman said the matter was being looked into.
