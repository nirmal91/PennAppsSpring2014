President Jean-Bertrand Aristide announced at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico, that he would hold legislative elections within six months, a move intended to quell growing opposition in Haiti to his leadership. Mr. Aristide did not set a date. Haiti's legislature essentially ground to a halt on Monday night as the terms of most of its elected representatives expired. Protests against Mr. Aristide have been growing, and his opponents, who accuse him of corruption and mismanagement, want him to step down now, two years before his term is scheduled to end in 2006.
