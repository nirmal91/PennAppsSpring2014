India will allow local companies and partnership firms to invest up to 100 percent of their net worth in ventures overseas. The country's central reserve bank said companies looking to invest more than $100 million had previously needed approval from the bank. But the new rule abolished the monetary ceiling on such investments. The move was intended to allow Indian companies to take advantage of opportunities abroad and to acquire skills to adopt at home, the bank said. India's foreign exchange reserves are at a record high of more than $100 billion.
