Tired of hot chocolate that can set you back $5 a cup? Try the lobby of the Regency Hotel, 61st Street and Park Avenue, where the hot chocolate is free to anyone, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., on days when the temperature dips below freezing. Back near the elevators, the hotel has set up a stand for self-service hot chocolate, a steaming winter warmer that the chef, John Iachetti, makes just rich enough by melting his chocolate in half-and-half. Minimarshmallows, chocolate swizzles and peppermint sticks are available as garnishes. In summer, when it's above 80 degrees, there will be fresh lemonade for all.
Prefer coffee? This Saturday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Bakery Soutine, 104 West 70th Street, is celebrating its 20th anniversary with free coffee and cake.
