Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Sunday about cancer prevention at medical centers misidentified the health agency that is requiring prevention components at designated centers and spending $500 million, or 12 percent of its budget, toward prevention. It is the National Cancer Institute, not its parent agency, the National Institutes of Health. The article also misstated the affiliation of a cancer expert, Dr. Barnett Kramer. He is director of the office of disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, not the Cancer Institute.
