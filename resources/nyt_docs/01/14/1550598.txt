Jody Oberfelder Dance Projects  Joyce SoHo
Jody Oberfelder's ''Landmarks of Dreams,'' partly inspired by the paintings of Marc Chagall, is an amiable fantasy presented on Friday.
There were no attempts to interpret specific canvases. Katrin Schnabl's costumes were austere; Hal Buckner's set was a suspended branchlike construction. The lifts and balances of Ms. Oberfelder's acrobatic choreography filled the stage with ever-changing shapes.
Many scenes were simply swirls of activity. In others, choreographic images suggested the enigmatic shapes that can appear in dreams. Still others hinted at the depictions of Russian Jewish life in Chagall's paintings.
There were times when groups of people seemed architectural constructions made of human building blocks. When dancers moved in lines, kicked up their heels or slapped their sides, their motions suggested folk dancing.
A potentially fascinating mixed-media episode failed to make an effect. Ms. Oberfelder danced a solo while the backdrop glowed with what the program said was underwater photography by Pamela Crimmins. Yet the bands of color one saw did not really evoke an aquatic realm.
Another ambitious scene that proved delightful featured Peter Sciscioli, a dancer who is also a violinist. As he fiddled, he hopped, jumped, rolled on the floor and let himself be lifted by other people while his shadow capered with him across the backdrop.
Ms. Oberfelder created her choreography in collaboration with her cast: Hope Davis, Martin Davis, Jen Mendez, Rebekah Morin and Mr. Sciscioli. The accompanying taped collage offered music by Frank London, the Klezmatics, Edward Ratliff, Louis Sclavis, Rob Schwimmer and David Yengibarjan.
