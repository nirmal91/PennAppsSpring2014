The Human Relations Commission of Atlanta has decided that the Druid Hills Golf Club is violating a city ordinance by refusing spousal privileges to two gay members' domestic partners. The commission has the power only to advise Mayor Shirley Franklin, who has 30 days to make a decision. If she decides against the club and it does not change its practice, it could lose its business and liquor licenses. The complaint is the second legal challenge to a country club for discrimination against same-sex couples, said Jon Davidson, senior counsel for Lambda Legal, which is scheduled to argue the first such challenge, against the Bernardo Heights Country Club of San Diego, in the California Court of Appeal next month.
