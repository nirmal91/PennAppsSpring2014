To the Editor:
My husband and I didn't mind the 9 minutes 33 seconds of closing credits at the end of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (front page, Jan. 11). We walked out.
But we were annoyed and resented the more than 15 minutes of pre-feature credits we endured as a captive audience.
Perhaps theaters should post the starting times of the feature film, and let the customer decide if he wants to watch the advertising.
