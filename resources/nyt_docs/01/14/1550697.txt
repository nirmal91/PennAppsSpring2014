To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman is entirely correct in the strong stress he puts on the importance of Turkey's admission to the European Union (''War of Ideas, Part 2,'' column, Jan. 11).
More than 20 years ago, I served as ambassador to Turkey and spent much time in Ankara advocating this idea to my colleagues from European countries.
Most of them privately agreed but warned of the cultural barriers that made the issue a difficult one for their governments.
A long time has passed and time may run out before too long to avoid the ''huge mistake'' Mr. Friedman warns against. The reasons are even stronger today.
