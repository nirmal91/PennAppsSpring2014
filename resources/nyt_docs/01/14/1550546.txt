Taking pity on desperate smokers, Joseph Franco, the owner of Caff√© on the Green, 201-10 Cross Island Parkway in Bayside, Queens, has set up a tent, the Butt Hut, outside his restaurant and catering hall, once the home of Rudolph Valentino. It has heat, lights and seats. ''But I never go in there,'' Mr. Franco said. ''I'm not a smoker.''
Smokers can also take shelter in a stretch limo parked in front of the David Burke &amp; Donatella restaurant on East 61st Street. Stickers on the windows say ''Smoking Room.''
