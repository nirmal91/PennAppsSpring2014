Water buffaloes have always been considered the source of the finest mozzarella. But the only way to get it was to import it from Italy. Last spring, at his Star Hill Dairy in Woodstock, Vt., David Muller began milking a small herd of water buffaloes to make yogurt. That turned out to be a delicious tease, because now he is also producing the only buffalo mozzarella made in the United States. Star Hill Dairy's is certainly fresher than any Italian import. A small snowy globe, a mere four ounces, is satiny and just firm enough on the outside to hold its sumptuously creamy heart. Without the ripe summer tomatoes and basil it deserves, consider serving it with a drizzle of fruity olive oil and some lightly saut√©ed mushrooms or slices of roasted beets.
Woodstock Water Buffalo mozzarella is sold in water in plastic containers for $6.99 each at Whole Foods markets. It can be ordered online from www.starhilldairy.com for $32 for four containers, $64 for eight, plus a hefty shipping fee. The Web site lists many retail sources.
