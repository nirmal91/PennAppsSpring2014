Patrick McEnroe, the United States Davis Cup team captain, said Andy Roddick's commitment to playing in Cup matches went beyond the first-round match Feb. 6-8 against Austria in Uncasville, Conn.
''He's been extremely positive,'' McEnroe said at a luncheon in Manhattan.
Roddick, the United States Open champion, will be the first No. 1-ranked player to represent the United States in the Davis Cup since Andre Agassi led the team to a 3-2 victory over the Czech Republic in a 2000 quarterfinal.
McEnroe said he would use the Australian Open, which will begin Monday, to help him decide on his No. 2 singles player. Mardy Fish and Taylor Dent have a slight edge because of their performance at the end of last season, McEnroe said. The twins Bob and Mike Bryan are scheduled to play doubles.
