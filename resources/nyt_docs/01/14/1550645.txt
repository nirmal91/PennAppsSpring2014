To the Editor:
Regarding the article ''Roasting a Pig Inside an Enigma'' (Jan. 7) on the Cuban pig-roasting box called the caja china, I have a possible explanation for the derivation of the name. The cajita china (small Chinese box) is a percussion instrument. First imported to Cuba by Chinese immigrants, the cajita china is now a traditional feature of Cuban danzon, rumba and son bands. The instrument is shaped just like the pig cookers, rectangular with an opening on the top (there are no handles, but the Cajita China is played with two sticks).
