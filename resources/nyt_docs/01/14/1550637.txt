The country of Georgia has a fierce political history and remains torn by separatist guerrillas. Bombs explode regularly in the capital, Tbilisi, and large parts of the government, the security forces and the business sectors are controlled by mafias. All of that makes Georgia an unlikely site for what have been relatively hopeful events in the last several weeks.
First, Georgians staged a popular rebellion against a corrupt and autocratic regime. Then, in a clean election, they voted overwhelmingly for Mikhail Saakashvili, the hero of that revolution, who is 36, educated in New York, personable, confident and politically adept.
He brings unusual assets to face Georgia's crushing problems, and he must be exceedingly careful not to squander them.
Mr. Saakashvili's most important advantage is his alliance with two former speakers of Parliament, who both gave up their presidential ambitions to support him. The three of them are part of a dynamic generation of educated young leaders. Mr. Saakashvili, who can be arrogant, must maintain this alliance. The others can push needed changes through the Parliament, and will help him avoid the temptation to make a cult of his leadership.
His major challenge will be the economy. Georgia produces very little that it can sell abroad. Corruption helped many Georgians get rich but discourages legitimate business. And Georgia is perhaps the most corrupt remnant of the Soviet Union, which is no small distinction. Theft in the energy sector is particularly pernicious. Mr. Saakashvili should tackle that first, and then he must repair relations with Russia.
Mr. Saakashvili has been justice minister and head of Tbilisi's City Council, and he is aware of the challenges he faces. If he can resist falling into demagoguery, he is perhaps better equipped than his predecessors to meet them.
