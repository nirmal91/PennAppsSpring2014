To the Editor:
I thoroughly enjoyed your article on the caja china. Just a few linguistic observations that may or may not be relevant to the origins of this contraption's name. A ''caja china'' in everyday Spanish is a set of nested boxes: a box within a box within a box.
An English-speaking literary critic, referring to a story within a story within a story, might evoke the image of the ''Russian doll''; a Spanish-speaking critic would probably talk about ''cajas chinas.''
I wish I had the space and, these days, the weather, to make use of a caja china here in Manhattan.
