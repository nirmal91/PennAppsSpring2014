Prime Minister Ariel Sharon raised the possibility on Tuesday that the Israeli military could one day withdraw from the Gaza Strip, where large numbers of troops guard Jewish settlers.
In remarks to Bedouin soldiers who have served in Gaza, Mr. Sharon again indicated that he is considering scaling back the Israeli presence in lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
''I hope that the day will come when we won't have to be in the strip and you will truly be free to handle more essential matters,'' Mr. Sharon said on Israeli television and radio. He spoke in the southern Israeli village of Segev Shalom, not far from Gaza.
Mr. Sharon has said that Israel will eventually have to leave some parts of the West Bank and Gaza, either in a peace deal with the Palestinians or through unilateral measures.
