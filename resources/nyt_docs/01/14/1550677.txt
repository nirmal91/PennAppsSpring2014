Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopolus in Boston is expanding for the first time in four years by acquiring Erwin-Penland in Greenville, S.C. Terms of the deal, to be announced today, are not being disclosed.
Erwin-Penland and Hill, Holliday share a client, Verizon Wireless. Erwin-Penland creates campaigns for Verizon in the Southeast and Southwest, and Hill, Holliday creates campaigns for the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. The acquisition is the first for Hill, Holliday since it expanded to San Francisco in 2000 when its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, bought Goldberg Moser O'Neill Advertising.
''We're looking to grow in places that are growing, in fields that fit into what we do, like telecommunications, financial services and technology,'' Michael Sheehan, president at Hill, Holliday, said. Erwin-Penland will continue under that name and with the current management, he added, as part of Hill, Holliday.
The president at Erwin-Penland, Joe Erwin, said he was pleased with the agency's progress since he acquired what had been Penland Advertising in 1986, growing from ''one employee and one account to about 125 employees and billings of $125 million to $130 million'' from clients that include BMW and Michelin North America.
''But if we want to go to the next level, compete with the larger agencies in the Southeast, we need more resources,'' Mr. Erwin said. ''This will give us the resources to compete to win -- maybe not every time, but we will be more competitive.''
