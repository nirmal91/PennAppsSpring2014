Two shopkeepers -- a husband and wife -- with the help of a neighboring vendor, fought off two armed attackers who were trying to rob them on Monday night, the police said yesterday. The two, Young Sang, 61, and her husband, Don Sang, 65, were slashed on the face and neck by one of the men, who used a box cutter, the police said. The attempted robbery began at 6:30 p.m. at Sang's Gift and Beauty on East 167th Street. After the two attackers -- the second armed with an air pistol -- tried to take cash from the register, the police said, the Sangs began struggling with them. Down the street, Soo Shin, 41, of Young Discount Shop, noticed a commotion and ran over, the police said, helping to restrain one suspect, identified as Julius Pena, 19, of the Bronx. The police arrested the other man, Alpha Reid, 22, who lives in the same building as Mr. Pena, later last night. Mr. Shin and the Sangs were treated at Lincoln Hospital and released.
