To the Editor:
I appreciated Thomas L. Friedman's Jan. 11 column describing Turkey as ''the only Muslim, free-market democracy in Europe.''
But can killing Kurds and oppressing them in the south be considered a democratic action?
Is refusing to acknowledge the Turkish genocide against Armenians also part of being democratic?
