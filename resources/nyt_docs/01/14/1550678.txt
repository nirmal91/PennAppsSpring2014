Bill Katz is stepping down after three years as president and chief executive at the flagship New York office of BBDO Worldwide, the agency said yesterday. The timing of his departure has not been determined.
Mr. Katz, 49, confirmed a report of the move that appeared on AdAge.com, saying he had decided ''some time ago'' to leave because after 23 years at the agency he ''wanted to take a break and recharge.''
He said the decision was his and not, as reported in trade publications, related to tensions between him and top executives like Ted Sann, vice chairman and chief creative officer at BBDO North America, or Andrew Robertson, president and chief executive at BBDO North America and president at BBDO Worldwide.
Mr. Katz's duties will be temporarily assumed by Mr. Robertson, working with Mr. Sann, who also serves as chairman and chief creative officer at BBDO New York, and Jeff Mordos, chief operating officer at BBDO New York.
Mr. Katz joined BBDO New York in 1981 as an account executive, became general manager in 1994, and was named president and chief operating officer in 1996. He was named to share the duties of chief executive in 1999 and became the sole chief executive in 2001.
Mr. Katz's departure comes at a time of unusual ferment at BBDO New York, typically one of the most stable agencies in the industry. Several executives have left recently, some to take senior posts at other New York agencies.
The BBDO New York client roster has also been in flux as the agency has lost assignments like Caress soap, the KFC fast-food chain and the Charles Schwab brokerage service as it gained accounts like Aquafina bottled water and two new products from Masterfoods.
