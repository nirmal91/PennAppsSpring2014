The television star Kelsey Grammer, who won fame in ''Frasier'' and ''Cheers,'' is in negotiations to take over the role of Max Bialystock, the rakish producer at the heart of the musical ''The Producers'' after Nathan Lane completes his current run in the role, the show's producers said yesterday.
A press agent for the show, John Barlow, confirmed that talks were being held with Mr. Grammer but would not comment further yesterday. The negotiations were first reported yesterday by TV Guide on its Web site, tvguide.com.
NBC announced this week that ''Frasier'' would end its 11-year run in May.
Mr. Barlow had no word on who might play Bialystock's sidekick, Leo Bloom, the accountant now played by Matthew Broderick, or when Mr. Grammer might take over. Both Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick are scheduled to complete their 14-week return engagements on April 4.
Mr. Grammer has some theatrical experience. In 2000 he played the title role in a Broadway production of ''Macbeth,'' that was panned by critics and lasted only 10 days. His comedic efforts, playing the pompous psychiatrist Frasier Crane in both ''Frasier'' and the earlier sitcom ''Cheers,'' were much more successful, however, suggesting that the role of Bialystock might be a better fit.
