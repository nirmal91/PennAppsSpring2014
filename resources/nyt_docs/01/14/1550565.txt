To the Editor:
''Young Doctors and Wish Lists: No Weekend Calls, No Beepers'' (front page, Jan. 7) does a disservice to dermatology.
The vast majority of dermatologists are not dermatologists because of an easy lifestyle but because of their dedication to the treatment of diseases of the skin, hair and nails.
Dermatologists treat patients with life-threatening conditions every day, including the care of skin cancers.
Dermatologists are also at the forefront of volunteerism and research. Since 1985, dermatologists provided 1.3 million free skin cancer screenings through the American Academy of Dermatology skin cancer screening program.
Dermatologists also lead research for treatments of life-altering skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema.
Dermatology is attracting the best and the brightest talent in medicine, but dermatology training programs want applicants who are dedicated to the science and art of dermatology and the care of patients, not an easy lifestyle.
