Representative Richard A. Gephardt offered a vigorous defense yesterday of his vote in favor of the use of force in Iraq and marched squarely into a debate that has roiled this presidential campaign.
In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and in response to questions afterward, Mr. Gephardt emphasized that he had conferred with officials at the Central Intelligence Agency and advisers to President Bill Clinton before concluding that Iraq was a serious threat.
He said he did not regret his decision, although his advisers acknowledge that it had cost him support.
''Yes, I supported the Congressional resolution that gave President Bush the authority to act in Iraq, even as I urged him to seek multilateral support through the United Nations,'' Mr. Gephardt said.
''I don't apologize for that,'' he said, ''and I'm not sorry that Saddam Hussein is gone.''
But Mr. Gephardt was sharply critical of Mr. Bush's handling of the occupation of Iraq and the crises in North Korea and the Middle East.
He described the occupation as ''a deadly quagmire'' and criticized the president as having alienated American allies in Europe.
''My problem with the Bush foreign policy team, and the cold warriors they've brought out of semi-retirement to run it, is their overwhelming arrogance and lack of appreciation for the subtleties of democracy-building or alliance-strengthening,'' Mr. Gephardt said.
