To the Editor:
Re ''Who Was That Food Stylist? Film Credits Roll On'' (front page, Jan. 11):
I would like to apologize to your reporter on behalf of the entire film industry (specifically, on behalf of all those dull people listed in the credits of the films that he enjoys) for wasting his precious time with movie credits.
As a cinematographer who works on feature films, I have learned that no one really deserves credit for making a film except the actors, the director, the screenwriter, the producers and, of course, the cinematographer.
Everyone else who works 14 hours a day for months straight on a film should remain anonymous.
Understandably, your reporter does not want to know that filmmaking is a collaborative medium requiring legions of highly skilled and dedicated artisans (including a sports masseuse for those punishing martial arts sequences).
I do have a suggestion for your reporter the next time that movie credits get too long and boring for him. Leave.
