Laboratory tests have confirmed that Nigeria was the source of the polio virus that led to two new cases of the crippling disease in Benin and Cameroon in West Africa, the World Health Organization said. On Thursday, the W.H.O. is holding an emergency meeting of health ministers from countries where polio cases are occurring to assure the agency's efforts to eradicate the disease by 2005. A grave concern is opposition to polio vaccination by some Muslim leaders in the north of Nigeria who have forced suspension of the immunization program there. Nigeria has exported polio cases to at least six West African countries in recent months.
