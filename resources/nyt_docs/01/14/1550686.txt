To the Editor:
Re ''Who Was That Food Stylist? Film Credits Roll On'' (front page, Jan. 11):
A film's long closing credits are not a result of inflated egos; quite the opposite is true.
They indicate an understanding that a film project is a collaborative effort and that each participant should be valued and acknowledged for his or her contribution, however small.
Assistants to assistants do not get seven-figure salaries or their names in lights, but the project doesn't succeed without them, any more than a business, school, hospital or government can succeed without the hard work, usually underpaid and underappreciated, of the most menial employees.
Let's hope that giving credit where it is due will someday carry over to all aspects of our society.
