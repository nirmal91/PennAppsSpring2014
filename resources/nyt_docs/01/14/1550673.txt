To the Editor:
Re ''The Other Doctor in Dean's House Shuns Politics'' (front page, Jan. 13): I find it refreshing to see a woman, whose agenda and daily schedule are determined by her, married to a man who determines his own personal schedule of life events.
Their marriage parallels that of many professional families, in which both careers are considered fully equal.
