Residents of this upstate hamlet, who have put up with discolored well water that smells like oil for more than 20 years, will have spring water delivered to them free until a seven-mile pipeline can be built to bring in fresh water from the St. Lawrence River. The New York State Environmental Protection and Spill Compensation Fund announced yesterday that it would pay for the bottled water and contribute up to $1.8 million toward the $7.3 million cost of the pipeline, expected to be completed by 2006. State officials said that for decades, gasoline and oil from leaking commercial and residential tanks spilled into the groundwater, eventually contaminating the wells of about half the 200 homes in Redwood, 23 miles north of Watertown. Starting in 1983, those homes were fitted with charcoal filters, paid for by the oil spill fund. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, above, whose office administers the fund, said the recent discovery of lead in the Redwood wells made financing the pipeline even more urgent.
