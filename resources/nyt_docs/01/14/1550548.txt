Vintage cocktail shakers, like these unusual glass ones, above, decorated with whimsical animals, including red elephants, not pink, are among the items that will be offered on Saturday and Sunday at Antiques at the Piers. This show and sale is devoted to American antiques and collectibles. Other barware, kitchenware and gadgets from the 1920's to the 60's will also be on sale. The silk-screened cocktail shakers, from Michael Smith of Depression Modern, are $85 each, at booth 1100 on Pier 88. The show is from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the passenger ship piers, 88, 90 and 92, at 12th Avenue and 55th Street. Admission is $12.
