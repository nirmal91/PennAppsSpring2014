Wyoming's plan for managing its gray wolf population was rejected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which said the state must include greater monitoring and protection. The wildlife service plans to eliminate federal protection for wolves, which recovered in number in the 1990's, but will not begin the process until Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have plans in place for managing and maintaining the packs. Plans by Idaho and Montana have already been accepted.
