Seven religious statues, most a century old, were smashed yesterday in the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio by a man who proclaimed himself God and shouted that he wanted to save worshipers by destroying idols, the police said.
A suspect, a 38-year-old San Antonio man whose name was not released, was restrained by parishioners until the police arrived. The damage exceeded $200,000, the authorities said.
The Roman Catholic cathedral, which dates to 1738, is the oldest church in the city and houses what is believed to be the oldest cathedral sanctuary in the United States.
It underwent a $6 million restoration last year.
