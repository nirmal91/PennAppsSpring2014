To the Editor:
Re ''The Other Doctor in Dean's House Shuns Politics'' (front page, Jan. 13): The Deans' marriage works for them -- so what if she doesn't fit into an artificial category thought up by some ''expert'' in first lady-dom? I find it refreshing that Howard Dean's marriage can't be pigeonholed any more than his approach to politics.
