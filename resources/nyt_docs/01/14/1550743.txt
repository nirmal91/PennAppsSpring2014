New York City children were less likely to be hospitalized for asthma in 2002 than at any time since the city started keeping track in 1984, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported yesterday. The rate declined 44 percent from 1993, yet there were still 9,821 hospitalizations in 2002, and asthma remains a leading childhood health threat. There is no sign that asthma has become less prevalent. Rather, officials say, it is better controlled, after years of public education campaigns urging doctor visits, regular use of medication and avoidance of situations that trigger attacks. Out of every 1,000 children in the city under age 14, 6 were hospitalized for asthma in 2002. The Bronx had the highest rate, 9.7 per 1,000, followed by Manhattan, 5.8; Brooklyn, 5.5; Queens, 4.6; and Staten Island, 2.8.
