A Critic's Notebook article yesterday about three plays at La MaMa Experimental Theater Club misspelled the surname of the director of two of them, ''Out at Sea'' and ''Striptease.'' He is Paul Bargetto, not Barghetta. The article also misidentified the neighborhood for the club. It is the East Village, not the Lower East Side.
