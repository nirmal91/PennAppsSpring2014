The federal government imposed an immediate embargo on the import of civet cats, a relative of the mongoose, because of concerns that they have spread the SARS virus to humans in China. ''This embargo will help us protect the American public and prevent introduction of SARS in the United States,'' said Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services. This month, officials in Guangdong Province in southeastern China ordered the killing of every civet cat in captivity in the province after researchers found that a Guangdong man had fallen ill with a new strain of SARS virus that is genetically similar to a strain found in civet cats. The civet is considered a delicacy in parts of China.
