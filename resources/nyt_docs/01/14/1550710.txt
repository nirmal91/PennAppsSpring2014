The French catering company Sodexho Alliance asked the French financial market regulator to investigate a 3.5 percent decline in its share price on Monday after a report issued by Citigroup's Smith Barney questioned a filing it made with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. The filing disclosed that a Sodexho subsidiary in Britain had packaged 82 million euros in loans ($104 million) and sold them as securities. The Smith Barney report said the securitization had not been previously disclosed and might have been the reason Sodexho's results were better than expected last year. Sodexho's chief financial officer, Sian Herbert-Jones, said the accounting had been previously disclosed and did not account for the company's better-than-expected cash flow. The company said it would wait until the French regulator investigates to decide on further legal action.
