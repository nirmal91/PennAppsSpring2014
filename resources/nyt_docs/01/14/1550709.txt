Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that it would invest $1 billion over the next five years to expand its manufacturing operations in Singapore, where it will shift some production from the United States. The company said the move would permit it to more quickly meet rising demand from China and South Korea for its high-end servers and printers. While many manufacturers have been moving jobs out of Singapore, Hewlett-Packard has nine factories there.
