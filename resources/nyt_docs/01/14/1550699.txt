To the Editor:
Re ''War of Ideas, Part 2,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 11):
Western civilization is caught in the middle of a Muslim-versus-Muslim conflict.
Yes, ''we are living at a remarkable hinge of history'' where moderate Islam is destined to win. This victory does not need the help of the West as much as it needs the West not to adopt foolish policies that strengthen fanatical Islam.
