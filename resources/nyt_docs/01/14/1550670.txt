To the Editor:
Your Jan. 13 front-page article about Dr. Judith Steinberg Dean, Howard Dean's wife, is an affront to many women. She has not ''shunned'' politics; rather, she has chosen to be faithful to her patients.
Dr. Steinberg has spent her whole adult life as a physician. She has raised two children, appears to have a good marriage and participates in community affairs.
Her husband's decision to run for office is his decision, not hers. Why should she be required to abandon her patients and compromise her career? Rather, she should be praised for her commitment to her medical practice.
In this age of celebrity and materialism, Judith Steinberg should be admired for her desire to remain true to her own values and for her decision to be a responsible doctor.
In my estimation, Dr. Steinberg is an important model for modern women.
