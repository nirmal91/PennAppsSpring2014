Mullah Krekar, an Iraqi Kurd and the founder of the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Islam, will remain in custody until Feb. 2, according to a judge's order. He was arrested in Oslo on Jan. 2 on charges of helping to plan murders in Northern Iraq two years ago. The police and prosecutors asked for the extended detention while they investigated. Ansar al-Islam has been blamed for attacks against American-led occupation forces in Iraq.
