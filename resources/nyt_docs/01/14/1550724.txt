For the first time since separatists began an insurgency in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir 15 years ago, the Indian government has formally invited separatist leaders to New Delhi for talks, officials said. Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani will meet with leaders from the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, a coalition of nonviolent separatist groups, on Jan. 22.
