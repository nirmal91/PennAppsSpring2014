President Chandrika Kumaratunga said she would not take over the stalled peace effort with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he wanted to withdraw from the peace effort with the Tigers because the president had stripped him of control of the military. The president and prime minister have been in a political standoff since November, when the president fired three ministers and took over the military and state media. ''The prime minister cannot walk away from the cease-fire agreement, because he brokered it, and I won't take responsibility,'' President Kumaratunga said in a statement read by her spokesman, according to Bloomberg News.
