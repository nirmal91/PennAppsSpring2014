An article in Science Times on Jan. 6 about alternatives to the banned weight-loss supplement ephedra referred incorrectly to approved uses for another drug, topiramate (sold by Ortho-McNeil as Topamax). The Food and Drug Administration has approved it as an add-on treatment for epilepsy. Approval to treat migraine headaches or as a single treatment for epilepsy is pending.
The article also misstated Ortho-McNeil's plans to test a controlled-release form of topiramate. The company plans to test its potential to treat people with obesity who also have Type 2 diabetes, not just those with obesity.
The article also referred imprecisely to the government role in regulating such supplements. The Food and Drug Administration indeed exercises some regulatory oversight, by requiring that the products contain the ingredients listed on the labels. But it does not require approval before sales (as it does for prescription drugs), nor does it require manufacturers to prove the products are safe and effective before sale.
