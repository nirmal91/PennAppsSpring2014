The world's largest office equipment maker, Canon Inc., said that it earned 276 billion yen ($2.6 billion) last year, an increase of 45 percent over the previous year, helped by strong demand for its copiers and digital cameras. Canon said sales rose 4.1 percent to 3.2 trillion yen ($30 billion). In 2004, Canon said it expected its profit to increase another 3.7 percent.
