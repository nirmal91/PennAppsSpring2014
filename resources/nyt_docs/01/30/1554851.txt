A computer chip maker, STMicroelectronics, said that its fourth-quarter profit fell to $144 million from $161 million a year earlier despite an 18 percent increase in revenue. The chief executive, Pasquale Pistorio, said that the company's gross margin slipped to 35 percent from 36 percent because of the weak dollar, reorganization costs, lower prices and a blackout in Italy in September. STMicroelectronics is based in Geneva.
