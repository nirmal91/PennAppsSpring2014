WHO -- Joe Marini, 30, at front in photograph, owner of a Brooklyn catering and floral design business, and John Simoudis, 38, an art director in Manhattan  WHAT -- 2-bedroom house  WHERE -- Westbrook, Conn.
Joe: My grandfather immigrated to Yonkers from Italy in the 1940's, and he used to build houses like these in Albany. Eventually, my father took over the business, and now all three of my brothers work for him. My legacy has been a keen understanding of structure and an appreciation for good workmanship. During the 1950's, building codes were still strict, and there was a genuine pride in workmanship. When John and I started looking at cottages near the beach, we were being shown places with walls so thin you could poke a hole with your finger. This house was built in 1952, and it is completely solid. It's brick with a stone foundation.
John: Joe's view of a house is informed by his understanding of construction. My reaction to a house has a lot more to do with emotion. In my case, the stone and brick construction, and the fact that the house is near water, resonated with my personal history. I was raised in Greece.
Joe: We wanted a house near the water, but we didn't want to go to Long Island or New Jersey. Since buyers in Connecticut tend to want older houses, these midcentury ones cost a lot less.
John: Thinking about things this way had great results. We have a house that's only two hours from New York and two minutes from the beach.
Joe: Plus, the way I look at it, it's less than 50 years before this place is a century old, anyway.
John: In the meantime, we can get out of the city anytime we like and head for the beach -- even if, on certain days, it's only 3 degrees outside.
