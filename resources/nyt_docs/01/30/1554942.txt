Ten communities in New York State, including Smithtown on Long Island, will receive a total of $9.7 million to help safely cap and close old landfills so they meet rigid environmental standards, Gov. George E. Pataki's office announced yesterday. The money, from the state's Environmental Protection Fund, will cover up to 90 percent of the cost of closing the inactive landfills and preventing hazardous substances from leaking into the ground and contaminating water supplies. Smithtown, in Suffolk County, will receive $2 million to clean up a 23.5-acre landfill on Old Northport Road.
