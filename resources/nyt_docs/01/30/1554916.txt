The Project  37 West 57th Street, Manhattan  Through Feb. 8
Depending on your point of view this exhibition either distills William Pope.L's mordant self-deprecating performance art into a few DVD's and photographs, or it provides a mild appetizer for ''eRacism,'' his punchier midcareer survey at Artists Space in SoHo that has a second section at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.. It is probably a bit of both.
One DVD documents part of the artist's well-known performance ''The Great White Way, 22 Miles, 5 years, 1 Street,'' which shows Mr. Pope.L wearing a capeless Superman costume, with a skateboard strapped to his back, crawling painfully along the sidewalks of Lower Manhattan on his stomach as people step aside, gawk or look away. He's an emasculated superhero, a downtrodden black man and a dedicated penitent, spurred by faith.
In ''A Negro Sleeps Beneath the Susquehanna (What's My Name?),'' he wears only boots and a jockstrap while hoisting a small table above his head like a big parasol, as if he were the attendant to some African king. But the setting is a quintessentially North American pine forest, not a jungle, and the native hosts appear to be several white people sitting on rough-hewn benches. As he moves, white flour rains down from the table, like snow. In ''Member (Rituals of Ridicule and Appreciation),'' Mr.Pope.L stands on a New York street corner, stretching over his head, face and mouth a white rubber glove whose fingers point upward, like a cock's comb. When he exhales, the fingers inflate -- vaguely defiant and obscene.
There's an unformed, unpredictable quality to Mr. Pope.L's work, almost a kind of lameness, until you realize that the people watching him are an essential part of his ephemeral, provocative uneasy-making ploys.
