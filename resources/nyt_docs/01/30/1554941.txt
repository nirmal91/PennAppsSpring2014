A city correction officer has been arrested and charged with engaging in a sex act with an inmate, the city's Department of Investigation said yesterday. The officer, Anthony Phillips, 45, who has 18 years in the Department of Correction, was also charged with sexual abuse and assault for punching the inmate and shoving his head under a running faucet in a jail area of the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street early Wednesday morning after the inmate tore his clothing, according to court documents. He was arraigned and released on $5,000 bail Wednesday, a department spokeswoman said. Officer Phillips, who was suspended without pay, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
