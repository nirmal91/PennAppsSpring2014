The Nintendo Company cut its profit forecast for the year that ends in March, citing weak sales of its video games in Japan. The company expects to earn 54 billion yen ($509 million) this fiscal year, 10 percent less than expected earlier. Nintendo also trimmed its sales goal by 7 percent, to 510 billion yen ($4.8 billion).
