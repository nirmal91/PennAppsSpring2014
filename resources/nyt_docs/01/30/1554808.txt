It has been 15 years since the Exxon Valdez fetched up on a reef in Prince William Sound in Alaska, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and dealing biological and economic shocks to the sound and its adjacent communities, none of which have fully recovered. In 1991, the ship's owner -- now Exxon Mobil -- reached a $900 million civil settlement with the federal government and Alaska. Its obligations to the thousands of fishermen and others who suffered from the spill remain unresolved. It is past time for the company to pay up and put the entire sorry episode behind it.
On Wednesday, Russel Holland, a federal district judge in Anchorage, imposed punitive damages of $4.5 billion, arguing among other things that the company had knowingly allowed ''a relapsed alcoholic'' to command the ship. It was the judge's third attempt to find a figure that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would accept. That court vacated a jury award of $5 billion in 1995. It also asked the judge to reconsider the $4 billion he imposed in 2002 in light of a Supreme Court ruling saying that punitive damages should not dwarf economic damages.
Exxon Mobil, of course, will appeal, and the likelihood now is that the Ninth Circuit, tiring of this game of legal Ping-Pong, will attempt to set a final award. From where we sit, Judge Holland's $4.5 billion figure does not seem excessive. We say this mindful of the fact that Exxon has already paid out more than $3 billion in cleanup and other costs (a manageable figure for a company that yesterday reported a record $21 billion in profits for 2003). We are further mindful of the fact that some eye-popping jury awards are ridiculously high.
The problems with the tort system should not, however, confuse us as to its basic purposes. These, as stated by Judge Holland, are to achieve retribution and deterrence.
