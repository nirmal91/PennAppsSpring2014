Mexico's top law-enforcement officials said Thursday that 13 state police officers were under investigation for drug trafficking and murder, and they attributed a wave of 70 killings this month to internal warring among multibillion-dollar cocaine cartels.
Officials said the state police officers were being questioned here in the deaths of 11 people whose bodies were unearthed in the backyard of a house in Ciudad Juárez this week. None have been arrested.
The detained officers worked on night-shift drug squads in Ciudad Juárez, the capital of the state of Chihuahua, on the Texas border. Their commander has fled and is being sought for questioning.
''This is very serious,'' said Mexico's chief organized-crime prosecutor, José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos. ''It points to extreme corruption in the police force, extreme corruption in law enforcement.''
In Mexico, drug trafficking is a $250-billion-a-year industry, and its main customers are Americans. Over the past decade, thousands of law-enforcement officers have been fired and hundreds jailed.
Correction:  February 6, 2004, Friday  An article last Friday about an investigation of 13 Mexican police officers in connection with drug trafficking and murder referred incorrectly to Ciudad Juárez, where the officers worked. It is Chihuahua state's largest city; the capital is Chihuahua City.
