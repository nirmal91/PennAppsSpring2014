The Florida attorney general's office  awarded an assignment yesterday to create a national safe-driving campaign, aimed at owners of sport utility vehicles, to the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Spending on the campaign, a one-time assignment, will be $27 million.
The decision, first reported by AdAge.com, came after a lengthy review that had been narrowed to Bartle Bogle and two other finalists: Euro RSCG Tatham Partners in Chicago, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, and Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe.
The campaign will be financed from a $51.5 million settlement between the Ford Motor Company and officials of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. The officials, led by Florida's office, had charged that Ford's advertising for sport utilities like the Explorer misled consumers about their safety.
