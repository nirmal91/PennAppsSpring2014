Firefighters in Greenwich called yesterday for the town's fire chief, Daniel Warzoha, to step down over what they said was poor judgment he exercised at a fire in December, charging that he had been intoxicated. A representative for the Greenwich Fire Fighters Association, the union for firefighters in Greenwich, whose department includes volunteers and paid firefighters, said an investigation ordered by the fire commissioner into Chief Warzoha's conduct concluded this week that he had been impaired during a fire on Dec. 5. Three firefighters suffered serious injuries during that fire when they jumped out a third-floor window to avoid being burned, the union representative said. Fire Commissioner James Lash, who is also the town's first selectman, declined to comment on the investigation, citing personnel privacy rules. Chief Warzoha could not be reached for comment.
