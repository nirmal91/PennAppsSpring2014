The Vincent Giordano Corporation is recalling 52,000 pounds of beef products that may be tainted with a bacterium. The meats, which are sold nationwide, were packaged on Dec. 16, 2003. Each of the products is marked with the code ''EST. 5397'' inside the inspection seal. Officials say the bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, can cause flulike symptoms and can be fatal to the elderly, infants and those with weakened immune systems.
