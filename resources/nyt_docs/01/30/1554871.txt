To the Editor:
Re ''Dump Cheney Now!,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 29), and ''Report on Iraq Case Clears Blair and Faults BBC'' (front page, Jan. 29):
Many politicians and others have been quick to judge the Bush and Blair administrations for leading their countries into an unnecessary war and are accusing both of manipulating intelligence. But based on the David A. Kay report and the Hutton inquiry in Britain, it appears that the two leaders acted on the intelligence information presented to them at the time.
Although in hindsight this intelligence may prove to be partly or completely erroneous, the president and the prime minister have a duty to protect their citizens. Had they stood idly by, they would have failed in this responsibility.
