To the Editor:
The failure of our intelligence (and the failure of our leaders to use it properly) is not merely troubling, but deeply unsettling as well (editorial, Jan. 29). It seems that the current administration would like to wage pre-emptive war based on nothing but covertly gathered intelligence. At home, meanwhile, it seeks even greater control, through the Patriot Act, over ordinary citizens in the name of security, and has even made arrests without allowing the public to scrutinize the evidence.
It was the lack of scrutiny that got us into the mess in Iraq in the first place. How many of our civil liberties will we allow to be abused in the name of security, based only on what we now know to be poor intelligence?
