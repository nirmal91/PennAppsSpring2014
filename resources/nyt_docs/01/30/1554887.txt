A six-alarm fire at a warehouse complex here started on Wednesday and burned through the night, destroying four buildings and delaying the morning rush Thursday as heavy smoke, visible from Manhattan, drifted onto the Pulaski Skyway.
Frigid weather complicated efforts to control the fire. A New York City fireboat was dispatched to the warehouses, along the Passaic River, but could not reach the scene because the lifting platform on the Lincoln Highway Bridge was frozen, fire officials said.
''The weather was terrible to us last night,'' said Deputy Chief Robert Osborn of the Kearny Fire Department. Three fire hydrants closest to the fire were frozen, forcing firefighters to stretch their hoses an extra 200 yards from the road to the fire.
There were no fatalities, but one firefighter, complaining of chest pains, received hospital treatment.
It took 150 firefighters from 9 p.m. Wednesday, when the fire was first reported, until 8 a.m. Thursday to bring the blaze under control.
Chief Osborn said that blowing wind helped to spread the fire, which appears to have started in Building 9, to three other buildings. All the buildings were destroyed, but according to firefighters, a quarter of the stock in Buildings 8 and 9 was rescued intact. ''When it's through the roof and when it's out of control, most of the time there's no saving it,'' Chief Osborn said. Businesses displaced by the fire included a fruit juice distributor, an auto parts company and a furniture warehouse.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Chief Osborn said.
