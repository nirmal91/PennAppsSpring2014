GBE (Modern)  620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street  West Village  Through Feb. 7
This New York debut, at Gavin Brown's renamed, relocated gallery, introduces Anselm Reyle, a promising young German painter born in TÃ¼bingen in 1970. Mr. Reyle works in a casually self-conscious shabby-chic style that might be called abject abstraction, or the New Arte Povera. His antecedents include the work of Blinky Palermo, Sigmar Polke and Richard Tuttle, as well as the more recent, more brittle and punkier efforts of Steven Parrino, Michael Krebber's stretched dry-goods paintings and the goofy formalism of James Hyde. His contemporaries are many.
Seemingly driven by the conviction that it doesn't take much to make a painting, Mr. Reyle's formalism is more rock 'n' roll than goofy. The best works incoporate touches of fluorescent pink, glitter, silver Mylar or expanses of black. These elements give a contemporary flash to obvious evocations of abstract styles past: gestural smears, hard-edge stripes, a black monochrome and a cascade of pours and drips reminiscent of 1970's Larry Poons. The power of pictorial illusion is summed up by a box on a pedestal that looks one way from a distance (tenderly painted brown and edged in gold) and another up close (burl veneer with interior lights shining through its seams). A wood industrial scale and a small butter churn, touched up with paint, may symbolize old tools being made new.
The ensemble forms a surprisingly beautiful, if overly conceptual, meditation on the ways, means and inevitability of pictorial illusion and an obvious critique of the automatic validity provided by the typical white-on-white gallery space. But it is hard to imagine all but the largest paintings surviving alone and even these look as if they could have been made by anybody. That may be the point, but one hopes this show does not give the full measure of Mr. Reyle's talent.
