The owners of a painting contracting firm pleaded guilty yesterday in State Superior Court to defrauding three New Jersey school districts of $1.5 million by paying their workers less than what they had been promised and pocketing the difference. The owners of the company, the Paint Smart Corporation, of Nutley -- Jose LoGreco, 53, the president, and Charles Paraboschi, 65, the vice president -- face a minimum of five years in prison each at their sentencing, set for May 7. The company was barred from receiving any future local, county or state contracts.
