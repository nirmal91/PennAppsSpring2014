Russia's government will hold an auction of oil-rich blocks on the remote eastern island of Sakhalin, despite a request from ExxonMobil for an exclusive deal, according to the Interfax news agency, which quoted the deputy prime minister, Viktor Khristenko. ExxonMobil had sought a ''production-sharing agreement'' for the oil fields, which guarantees stable taxes.
