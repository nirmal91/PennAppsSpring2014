Hewlett-Packard and Dell, the computer makers, will join the Blu-ray Disc Founders, a group of companies promoting one of the competing standards for next-generation DVD's. The group, which includes Sony, Matsushita Electric and Hitachi, is developing DVD disks and players that can store high-definition movies, television programs and other video. A rival group led by Toshiba and NEC is promoting another standard, and a consortium of Chinese companies is promoting a third.
