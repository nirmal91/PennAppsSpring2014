The Archdiocese of Boston has reached a settlement with the children of a woman who clergy personnel files show was left alone by a priest as she overdosed on barbiturates in 1973 and died the next day. According to the files, released in December 2002, the woman, Rita Perry, had been involved in a 13-year relationship with the priest, the Rev. James D. Foley. Tests show that Father Foley, who was removed in 2002, fathered two of Ms. Perry's four children. Details of the settlement were not released, but Archbishop Sean O'Malley apologized to Ms. Perry's children.
