An American who was detained and had his visa revoked for throwing a cup of water over a crying Brazilian baby on a flight from Miami to SÃ£o Paulo was to be deported, the police said. It was the second incident at the airport this month involving an American. Two weeks ago, an American Airlines pilot was ordered to pay a $13,000 fine after using a vulgar gesture to protest the fingerprinting of visiting Americans.
