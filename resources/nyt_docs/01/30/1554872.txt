To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Away From His Claims About Iraq Arms'' (front page, Jan. 28): Why do so many in the Bush administration fall all over themselves to justify the war in Iraq now? Is it in response to the former Treasury secretary's recent comment that from Day 1 the administration was looking for a justification for war? Or is it their worry that as our soldiers continue to die, a majority of the electorate might begin to think that it was not so much failed intelligence as the manipulation of that intelligence that led us into this debacle?
The recent spin by Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, that President Bush never said Iraq posed an ''imminent'' threat but a ''grave and growing'' one begs the issue.
Out here in the hinterlands, we want answers, not semantic distinctions.
