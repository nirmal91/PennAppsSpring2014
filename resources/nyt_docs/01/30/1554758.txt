The White House on Thursday called for an increase of $18 million in the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts this coming fiscal year.
The proposed increase, first described by administration officials on Wednesday, would be a 15 percent rise, the largest in two decades.
Laura Bush announced the plan at the Old Post Office Building, which houses the endowment. She said it would help Americans ''reconnect with our nation's great artistic achievements and rich cultural heritage.''
The National Endowment for the Arts, the largest single source of support for the arts in the United States, has had to fight for its life in recent years. Some Republicans have attacked the agency as a threat to the nation's moral standards.
The White House proposal also faces an uncertain future because of looming budget deficits. Some members of Congress have vowed to oppose the increase.
The agency has a budget of $121 million this year, about 30 percent lower than its peak of $176 million in 1992. After Republicans gained control of Congress in 1995, they cut the budget to slightly less than $100 million.
