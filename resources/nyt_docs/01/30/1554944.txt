A man accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend in a Times Square hotel room during a dispute over money pleaded guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court to first-degree manslaughter, the district attorney's office said. Prosecutors said the man, Richard Jenkins, 49, of Portland, Ore., shot his girlfriend, Elizabeth Forman, 45, of Media, Pa., on Jan. 13, 2003, inside a room at the DoubleTree Guest Suites. The couple had met at a New York convention for the cult television show ''Dark Shadows.'' Mr. Jenkins had given Ms. Forman about $95,000 because she said she needed it, the authorities said, but he later concluded that she had been defrauding him. Justice Bonnie Wittner said she would sentence Mr. Jenkins to 25 years in prison on Feb. 26.
