One of the few remaining large independent agency companies, the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York, is independent no longer. Its owners have sold a 60 percent stake to MDC Partners in Toronto.
Though terms were not disclosed, The Wall Street Journal, which reported the deal yesterday, estimated that MDC would pay as much as $75 million in cash and stock, with payouts based on the future performance of Kirshenbaum Bond.
Kirshenbaum Bond, founded in 1987, has more than 200 employees in New York and San Francisco and billings estimated at $525 million from clients like Andrew Jergens, the Meow Mix Company, Target, Timex and the Verizon SuperPages. Jonathan Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum will continue as co-chairmen.
MDC, which has been seeking to expand in the United States, owns a majority interest in another New York agency, Margeotes/Fertitta &amp; Partners, and a 49 percent stake in Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami as well as agencies like Colle &amp; McVoy in Minneapolis and Bratskeir &amp; Company in New York.
