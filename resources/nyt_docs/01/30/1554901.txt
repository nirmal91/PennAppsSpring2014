The federal grand jury investigating possible corruption in the Rowland administration has issued a subpoena for all records of the Connecticut Development Authority's dealings with a close friend of Gov. John G. Rowland's.
The friend, Robert V. Matthews, is a key figure in several of the ethics controversies involving the governor, who has known Mr. Matthews for years and lived with him briefly while Mr. Rowland was separated from his first wife. The development authority under Mr. Rowland has given $4.7 million in loans and guarantees to Matthews companies.
The subpoena, issued Wednesday, seeks all records, including ''board meeting minutes,'' of the development authority's dealings with Mr. Matthews dating to Jan. 1, 1995, the start of Mr. Rowland's tenure as governor. Although the subpoena asks for records related to anything involving Mr. Matthews, it specifically names two companies, Fabricated Metal Products and Matthews Ventures.
Matthews Ventures was involved in an aborted business deal in 2001 in which Mr. Matthews helped a client seek millions of dollars in loans from the development authority. Mr. Matthews also sought the governor's assistance with the deal, which ultimately was not completed.
Around the same time the deal was falling apart, Mr. Matthews let Mr. Rowland stay a week at a luxury house he owns in Palm Beach, Fla.
The other company named in the subpoena, Fabricated Metal, got a $3.6 million loan guarantee from the development authority in 1997. That same year, Mr. Matthews helped Mr. Rowland to sell an apartment he owned in Washington for much more than others in the same complex.
