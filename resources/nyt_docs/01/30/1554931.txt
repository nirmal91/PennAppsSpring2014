Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the termination of a Justice Department program that monitored criminals' use of drugs referred imprecisely to its procedures. The program -- known as the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM -- tested new jail inmates in 35 cities for narcotics, not for narcotics violations. (Participation was anonymous, and the program was not used to prosecute drug crimes.)
