An incident Sunday in which the police were called to Eddie Griffin's hotel in New Jersey after a complaint about him was a misunderstanding, the Nets and the police said Thursday.
Griffin, who has yet to play for the Nets, left the team on Wednesday in Orlando and returned to Houston, saying he needed to resume therapy. Ed Stefanski, the Nets' senior vice president for basketball operations, said Sunday's incident ''had nothing to do with his departure.''
Griffin was treated for substance abuse and depression in November and December and was convicted of misdemeanor drug possession last week in Houston, where he still faces a felony assault charge.
The police were dispatched to the Renaissance Hotel in Rutherford, N.J., around 7 a.m. Sunday because a guest complained that Griffin was banging on his door. The 6-foot-10 Griffin said he was looking for a group of women he met earlier that night at a wedding in the hotel, the police said.
''Either they gave him the wrong room number or he mixed it up,'' said Detective Capt. Thomas Farrell of the Rutherford police. ''The guest was scared because he looked out of the door and saw this gigantic man.''
No arrest was made, and the police report said there was no indication that Griffin was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
''We heard it was just a misunderstanding at the hotel and he knocked on the wrong door,'' Stefanski said. He said he left a message for Griffin on Thursday that was not answered.
