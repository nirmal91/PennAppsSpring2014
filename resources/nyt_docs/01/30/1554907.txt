The Kennel Club, the body that oversees the Crufts dog show, the world's largest, has accepted the resignation of Peter Mann, the Crufts chairman, after anonymous critics searched the dog-breeding records of his wife, Joan, in the early 1970's and accused her of ''puppy farming.'' The term refers to mass production of litters, a practice now considered unethical and in some circumstances illegal. Mrs. Mann resigned as this year's best-in-show judge, citing the ''stress and anguish'' of ''scurrilous anonymous accusations.'' The Kennel Club did not dispute the allegations, which were sent to dog magazines. The records showed that Mrs. Mann, a breeder of Yorkshire terriers, registered 23 litters of 126 puppies in 1971. Some were sold to traders.
