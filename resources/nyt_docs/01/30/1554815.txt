Senator John Kerry's emergence as the leading Democratic presidential contender won him a new round of criticism on Thursday, but not from other Democrats seeking the nomination.
Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee, devoted much of a speech at the party's winter meeting here to questions about Mr. Kerry's positions on military strength and national security and his voting record over four terms as a senator from Massachusetts.
Mr. Gillespie's focus on Senator Kerry, compared with only passing references to other candidates -- Howard Dean, Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina -- left the impression that Republicans are convinced that Mr. Kerry is likely to be President Bush's opponent in November.
Mr. Gillespie cited at least eight examples, like a 1972 promise Mr. Kerry made to vote against military appropriations when he was running, unsuccessfully, for Congress and a 1995 Senate vote to cut spending for the F.B.I. by $80 million.
In another sign of Mr. Kerry's rise, the Republican Party of South Carolina, one of seven states with a Democratic primary or caucus on Tuesday, held a news conference with veterans to raise questions about the candidates' records, focusing particularly on Mr. Kerry, said Luke Byars, executive director of the state party.
