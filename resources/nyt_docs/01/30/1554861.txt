To the Editor:
Re ''In Online Auctions, Misspelling in Ads Often Spells Cash'' (front page, Jan. 28):
Other variations to consider (and perhaps profit from) are regional and generational differences in terminology (''track suit'' versus ''jog suit'' versus ''warmup outfit'') and grammatical errors and alterations (''ladys watch'' versus ''ladies' watch'').
Although trying to take advantage of an unknown number of alternative listings may result in big bargains, my most memorable dividend from the hunt has been a sore clicking shoulder!
