Lawyers for Mounir el-Moutassadeq, the only person convicted of involvement in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, asked Germany's highest court to overturn the verdict, and the court said it would decide by March 4 whether to order a retrial. Mr. Motassadeq, a Moroccan, was sentenced to 15 years last February for helping the Qaeda cell in Hamburg that produced three of the Sept. 11 pilots. The trial of a second Moroccan charged as an accessory to the attacks, Abdelghani Mzoudi, is to hear testimony today from a man described as an Iranian defector who has told German investigators he has information incriminating Mr. Mzoudi.
