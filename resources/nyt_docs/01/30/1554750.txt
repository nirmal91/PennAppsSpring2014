For drivers in much of the country, it has already been a long, cold winter of mornings spent scraping windshields, prying loose ice-crusted wipers and peering through partly defrosted glass.
But it doesn't have to be this way, according to Microheat, maker of the HotShot, a Walkman-size gadget that fits under the hood and heats windshield-wiper fluid to 145 degrees at the push of a button. The heated fluid not only melts ice but helps dissolve splattered bugs and oily road grime. According to Microheat, it also extends the life of wiper motors and keeps wiper blades soft longer.
Tucked under the hood, the HotShot is connected to the battery, the washer reservoir and the washer nozzles. Microheat recommends having it installed by a mechanic, and the price, with installation, is less than $200. The company has a deal to supply the device for some of an American automaker's vehicles, and it is working on systems to clean rear windows, headlights and the radar sensors used for active cruise controls.
Solomon Franco, a co-founder of Microheat who still owns a big stake in the company, comes not from Minnesota, but from Israel. When he first encountered windshield icing, while in England, he didn't think it was a good way to start the day -- but unlike most people, he did something about it.
