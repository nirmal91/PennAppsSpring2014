No testimony will be allowed at hearings about an accusation that a former deputy county executive sexually assaulted his assistant, the Nassau County Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, said last night. Ms. Jacobs, a Democrat, said that the legislature's Republican minority wanted to call witnesses who dealt with the complaint when hearings resume here on Monday into irregularities in the agencies run by the accused former deputy, Peter Sylver. But the county district attorney's office is investigating the assault accusation and asked that legislators refrain from taking testimony, she said. Mr. Sylver's lawyer has denied the accusation.
