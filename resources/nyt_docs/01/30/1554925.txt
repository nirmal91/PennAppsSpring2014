Lionel Tate, the teenager whose life sentence for killing a girl when he was 12 was overturned last month, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a deal that allowed his immediate release. Lionel , who turns 17 on Friday, was tried and convicted as an adult in 2001 for killing Tiffany Eunick, 6. Under the plea bargain, Lionel, who has spent three years in a juvenile prison, faces a year of house arrest and 10 years of probation. During the plea hearing, Deweese Eunick-Paul, Tiffany's mother, said, ''My wish is that Lionel will grow up and not hurt any other human being.''
