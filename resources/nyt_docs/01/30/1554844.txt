Responding to criticism from conservatives, the director of the National Institutes of Health has told lawmakers the government should continue to pay for studies of sexual behavior because they could have a powerful impact on public health.
Last fall, the Traditional Values Coalition accused the institutes of paying for ''smarmy projects'' and studies of ''bizarre sexual practices with little or no bearing on public health.'' The group asked Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to investigate.
Among the projects were a study of truckers, prostitutes, drug use and sexually transmitted diseases, and studies of sexual behavior in older men, sexual risk-taking and sexual dysfunction.
In a letter sent late Wednesday to Representative Tauzin and three other lawmakers, the institutes' director, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, said the battle against disease must include behavioral and social factors, not just biological ones.
''Unhealthy human behaviors have been estimated to be the proximal cause of over half of the disease burden in our country,'' Dr. Zerhouni wrote, referring to smoking, overeating, drug and alcohol abuse, the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and ''sex-related or other violent behaviors.''
His letter noted that there were 15 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases a year in the United States, nearly 4 million of them in teenagers, and that 65 million Americans had incurable sexually transmitted diseases.
An additional 800,000 to 900,000 people are infected with H.I.V., and its transmission seems to be increasing, even among older people. Prostitution, Dr. Zerhouni said, remains a major source of H.I.V. transmission.
As for studies of sexual dysfunction, he wrote, ''it has an enormous impact on the stability of families and is a major cause of divorce.''
