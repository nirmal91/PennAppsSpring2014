To the Editor:
Re ''Ex-Arms Monitor Urges an Inquiry on Iraqi Threat'' (front page, Jan. 29):
Before judging Central Intelligence Agency analysts, we should recognize the inherent difficulty of assessing weapons in a country ruled by a barbaric totalitarian regime.
Recall how badly West Germany underestimated the slide of the East German economy, despite having a common history and language.
The real problem has been the weakness of our covert effort, which critics attribute in part to our overreliance on technology. But the use of technology was made necessary by public hostility toward covert spying and restrictions placed on it by well-meaning but na√Øve legislation.
And we have seen restraints, if not bans, on C.I.A. recruitment at top colleges. Why should we expect better intelligence if we discourage our brightest students from intelligence careers?
