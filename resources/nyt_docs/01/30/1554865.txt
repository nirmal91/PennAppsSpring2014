To the Editor:
''George Bush, in Denial'' (editorial, Jan. 29) rightly takes President Bush to task for his ''strategy of spin and evade'' on Iraqi weapons. But calling for an independent investigation of ''the apparent intelligence failures on Iraq'' does not go far enough.
Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary, has said the Bush administration was planning for an invasion of Iraq even before 9/11. So the focus of an inquiry must be broader than the question of an ''intelligence failure.'' The American people deserve to know whether Mr. Bush or anyone in his administration were cooking the books to justify pre-emptive war.
