Federal agents arrested 29 illegal immigrants with sex crime convictions throughout Westchester County yesterday as part of a federal crackdown on sex offenders. The arrests came after months of planning between the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the Westchester County Department of Probation. Sex offenders who are illegal immigrants or legal permanent residents can be deported if convicted of a felony. Those arrested included a Mexican citizen who had abused his 4- and 7-year-old nieces and a Peruvian citizen who had raped a 14-year-old girl, officials said.
