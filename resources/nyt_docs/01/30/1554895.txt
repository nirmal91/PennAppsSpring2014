In a battle against rebel insurgency in the western Darfur area, a Sudanese plane bombed a border town in neighboring Chad, killing 2 civilians and 15 others, a United Nations official said. The official said it was the first time since war broke out a year ago between the Sudanese government and guerillas in Darfur that Chadian territory had been bombed.
