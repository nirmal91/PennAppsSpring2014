Jack Shainman Gallery  513 West 20th Street, Chelsea  Through Feb. 7
Photography from Africa is like no other photography, and we've only begun to become familiar with it. So far, West African studio portraiture has led the way in popularity, and this show introduces another artist in that tradition. Philip Kwame Apagya operates a commercial studio in a coastal town in Ghana, where he produces color portraits for a local clientele and larger versions for exhibition.
The latter make up this scintillating show, his first in the United States. For each picture, Mr. Apagya uses backdrops that he and assistants have painted -- some of outdoor urban scenes; others of business or domestic interiors. His clients, or in some cases professional models, pose as if physically interacting with the setting. A man appears ready to board a painted plane at Accra International Airport. A young man lifts a portable radio as if to place it on the shelf of a painted cabinet stocked with stereo equipment. A woman leans her elbow against a well-stocked painted refigerator. An office worker types away at a computer keyboard. In two separate pictures, a man and a woman kneel before a backdrop of a mosque.
In each case the pictures do what most portraits in any medium are meant to do, present their subjects as they wish to be seen: industrious or casually prosperous or devout. Mr. Apagya's pictures accomplish this with great inventiveness and wit, and with a shrewd historical perspective that combines fantasies of Western-style wealth with references to the African past. (One example is the two women adorned with Askan-style jewelry, for which Ghana was renowned.)
As part of his two-decades-old studio practice, he repaints his backdrops frequently to keep up with fashion trends. But judging by this show, his own high international reputation as an artist won't be changing anytime soon.
