Archibald Candy said yesterday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, just weeks after announcing the sale of its Fannie May and Fanny Farmer brands and the closing of its manufacturing plant and its 238 retail stores. The company, which is privately held, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on Wednesday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Chicago, where the company is based. Archibald listed assets of $50 million to $100 million and debt of more than $100 million. Archibald said the filing would not affect its Canadian subsidiary, which sells the Laura Secord brand.
