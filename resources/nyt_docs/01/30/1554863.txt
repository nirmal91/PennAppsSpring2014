To the Editor:
If it weren't such a grave issue, the Bush administration's fine-tuning of its main justification for taking our country to war would almost be pathetically funny (''Bush Backs Away From His Claims About Iraq Arms,'' front page, Jan. 28). Such justification has gone from bellowing that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, posing an imminent and serious threat to our country; to suggesting Iraq had ''weapons of mass destruction-related program activities''; to whimpering that Iraq was a ''gathering threat.''
David A. Kay, the administration's former weapons inspector, had the fortitude and integrity to tell a Senate committee, ''It turns out we were all wrong, probably, in my judgment'' (front page, Jan. 29). Would it be asking too much for this administration to, at the very least, look into the reasons as to why ''we were all wrong''?
