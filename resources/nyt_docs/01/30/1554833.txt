Sales at Japan's largest industrial electronics companies rebounded in the October through December quarter on strong demand for optical disk drives, cellphones and the semiconductors used in digital cameras and other hot-selling gadgets.
Toshiba, NEC and Fujitsu, which were hit hard by the downturn in spending on technology over the last few years, are benefiting from rising prices for high-end system and flash memory chips. The companies, which have all left the bulk DRAM chip business in recent years, are trying to rely less on the personal computer market and more on products that require sophisticated chips, like cellphones with embedded cameras.
NEC said sales in the quarter jumped 9.2 percent, while sales at Fujitsu rose 5 percent. Toshiba's sales were up 0.8 percent.
One-time gains also helped NEC and Fujitsu return to profits last quarter, while Toshiba said its losses grew because of its faltering laptop business. Fujitsu earned 7.6 billion yen ($72 million), in contrast to a 25 billion yen loss last year, helped by the sale of stock in Fanuc, a software company.
NEC earned 11 billion yen ($105 million) after a 4.5 billion yen loss in the last quarter of 2002, helped by several asset sales.
Toshiba was hurt by weak sales of home appliances and computers, and lost 9.3 billion yen ($87 million) in the October-December quarter, about a third more than in the 2002 period.
All three companies expect to post profits when the fiscal year ends in March.
