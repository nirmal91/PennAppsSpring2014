George Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2'' is a dazzling and demanding creation. It appeared rather pallid when the New York City Ballet offered it earlier this season at the New York State Theater. But on Tuesday night it was performed with far more glitter, even though the finale never achieved the proper splendor.
Jennie Somogyi, Charles Askegard and Teresa Reichlen headed the cast. Ms. Somogyi, who was new to her role, emphasized the choreographic contrasts in the first movement, knowing how to speed ahead and how to hold positions firmly and effectively. In her pas de deux with Mr. Askegard in the second movement, she invested phrases with mounting passion so that this long sequence gained a sense of momentum.
The closing segment was altered because, according to a management spokesman, Ms. Somogyi had injured her foot. She will be replaced in ''Swan Lake'' on Sunday afternoon by Caroline Cavallo, a guest artist from the Royal Danish Ballet.
Susan Walters was the piano soloist, and Maurice Kaplow conducted.
There was other fine dancing, too. Peter Boal was eloquent as the title character in Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son,'' which Andrea Quinn conducted. His prodigal was an innocent, eager and trusting youth who rushed headlong into folly and then was overpowered by the Siren of Darci Kistler.
Students from the School of American Ballet danced Michel Fokine's ''Chopiniana,'' with Nancy McDill as pianist. The production was unnecessarily austere. Yet Tyler Angle, the male soloist, looked at ease in the work's flowing style, which derives from 19th-century Romantic ballet.
