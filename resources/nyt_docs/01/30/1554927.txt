A judge said he needed more evidence before deciding whether the Barnes Foundation and its multibillion-dollar art collection could move from its home in a Philadelphia suburb to an urban setting near the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An article yesterday about a judge's delay of a decision on whether the Barnes Foundation can move its multibillion-dollar art collection into Philadelphia from a small suburb used an incorrect given name in some copies for the foundation's chief executive. She is Kimberly Camp, not Beverly.
