Industrial production fell 1.0 percent in December from November, more than expected, but output for the fourth quarter still rose at its fastest rate in nearly three decades, helped by a surge in exports of cars, electronics and steel. Production for the October-December period grew 15.3 percent from the previous quarter, the fastest growth since 1976.
