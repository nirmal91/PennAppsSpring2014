Puck Building  Houston and Layfayette Streets  SoHo  Through Feb. 1
The National Black Fine Art Show is the only New York art fairwhose sole criterion for inclusion is the race of the artist. It is generously inclusive of genres, which range from tribal to postmodernist, and of quality, which ranges from very good to junky.
In the tribal category one of the most remarkable attractions can be found at the In the Gallery booth: a pair of 19th-century West African elephant tusks, each carved in low relief with a dense pattern of people, animals and vines.
Several galleries have works by 19th-century American artists trained in European modes. Merton D. Simpson features an Albert Bierstadt-style landscape by Robert Scott Duncanson, and the 70th Art Gallery has a luminous gray river scene painted under the influence of Whistler by Henry Ossawa Tanner.
There are too many good works by American Modernists to list. Among the best are painterly pictures of flowers by Claude Clark at Thelma Harris and, at Aaron Galleries, a vigorous yellow painting by the Abstract Expressionist Beauford Delaney that is surely one of the fair's most museum-worthy works.
As for contemporary work, G. R. N'Namdi is showing swirling, vibrantly colorful compositions of cutout and painted paper by Al Loving; Noel Gallery has fiercely ironic self-portraits in black face by Beverly McIver; and Hearne Fine Art has tender figurative paintings with religious themes by Lawrence Finney that are unlike anything you are likely to find in a Chelsea gallery this weekend.
Hours: today, noon to 8:30 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $15. Information: (301) 263-0783 or www.blackfineartshow.com.
