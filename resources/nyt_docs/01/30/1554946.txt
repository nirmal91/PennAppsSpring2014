An employee of the Nassau County Correctional Center was arrested yesterday and accused of stealing underwear he was supposed to have handed out to poor inmates, law enforcement officials said. The worker, John Cofield, Jr., 39, of Uniondale, was accused of stealing more than $13,000 in packaged men's and women's underwear since 2002. Mr. Cofield, a jailhouse laborer for eight years, was in charge of dispensing the undergarments to needy inmates, the Nassau County district attorney's office said. He said he was giving them to family and friends, said Rick Hinshaw, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
