The chief executive of Aventis, Igor Landau, said that a $60 billion takeover bid made by its rival, Sanofi-Synth√©labo, was too low. Mr. Landau told a French radio station, Europe One, that his company was being undervalued by at least 30 percent and that no offer would be ''interesting'' unless it was increased by 40 percent to 50 percent.
