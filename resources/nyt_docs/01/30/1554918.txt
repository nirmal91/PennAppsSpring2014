Trevor Winkfield's patented blend of Pop Art, Surrealism and Victoriana remains a dependable source of formal and poetic gratification. His new, mostly easel-size paintings have an appealing modesty of scale and a fine balance of complexity and lucidity.
With their high-contrast colors and cartoon contours defining an array of layered, overlapping and interweaving forms -- broad and curvy shapes, sharp and spiky shapes, spiraling ribbons, stripes, rays and dots -- the paintings are optically enthralling. And the iconography of bottles, fish, flowers, fruits, vegetables, feathers, wings, furniture, architecture and sculptured human profiles, puzzled together into compositions of classical order and lively buoyancy, hints at some possibly deep metaphorical meaning.
You get the feeling that Mr. Winkfield's disjunctively scrambled images are loaded with private associations. An assiduous interpreter might discover some underlying narrative logic or an esoteric system like Neoplatonism. But the imagery might just as easily have been taken at random from a clip book of classical and Victorian emblems. Either way, the combination of mercurial imagination and excellent pictorial craftsmanship is a treat for both mind and eye.
