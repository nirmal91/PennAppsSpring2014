WHO -- Bill Bonnell, 55, designer, Greenwich, Conn.  WHAT --1958 Lincoln Continental Mark III convertible
I've read four car magazines a month for the last 45 years, so I know almost everything about every car made in America between 1952 and 1971. I've owned a few as well -- about a dozen, all of them from the 50's and 60's, which I consider the heyday of car design in America. When I buy a car, it's purely because of its design. In terms of looks, my 1958 Lincoln Continental was one of the most extreme cars of its time, and even today some people find it bizarre. But to me it's beautiful, a work of art with wheels.
The Lincoln is a piece of sculpture. When I look at it from any angle, it holds together. But the most striking thing is its scale. Ford wanted to compete with Cadillac, so it's a behemoth, just over 19 feet long and about 5,500 pounds. Ford radically restyled its cars that year, and the Lincoln looked like nothing before or since. It was a shot in the dark. The headlights flare up out of nowhere; I don't think anyone canted the headlights like that before. The rear window slants inward and can go up or down, even when the vinyl top is up, and there are big gouges by the front and rear fenders. Cars back then were designed as clay mockups, and you can tell someone had fun shaping this one.
Ford made only about 2,000 of these convertibles; you could live the rest of your life and never see one on the road. You have seen the car if you've watched ''North By Northwest.'' Eva Marie Saint drives a white one just like mine in a couple of scenes. She peels out of the Mount Rushmore parking lot and then pulls into a fake forest on a soundstage for a rendezvous with Cary Grant.
I was a car-crazy 10-year-old when the 1958 Lincoln Continental came out. Growing up in Homewood, Ill., I was known as the kid in school who doodled cars everywhere. My dad sold insurance, and the local Lincoln-Mercury dealer was one of his customers. One day I begged him to take me with him on a sales call because I wanted to see the new Lincoln. Even then, I liked the way it looked. Dad never bought a Lincoln; he couldn't afford one. This was back when the notion was that you'd work your way up a car company over the years; you'd start out at Ford, segue to Mercury and end up at Lincoln. Dad never made it past Ford.
I got a degree in industrial design and hoped to work in Detroit as a car designer. Recently there's been a renaissance in car design, but back in the 1970's, all the cars were so ugly that I couldn't imagine contributing to that. So I went into graphic design. Now, instead of designing beautiful cars, I collect them.
I got the Lincoln four years ago, when I was in Florida visiting my father. I saw an ad for it in the local paper. Fully restored, this was the nicest one I'd seen for sale. The owner was asking $17,000. I took it for a test drive around the Tampa airport. The steering in old cars is quirky; there's a delay between the act of turning the wheel and the car actually moving in that direction. Once you're used to it, you can build in the delay.
People say to me, ''I can't believe anyone drove a car that size.'' I guarantee that in 15 years people will look back at the Lincoln Navigator S.U.V. and say, ''I can't believe people ever drove cars that size.''
Car collecting doesn't dominate my life -- I'm not an addict, just a casual user. My garage only has room for one old car, so if I buy a car, I have to sell a car. I like to peruse eBay Motors, which is sort of like porn for car lovers. I've actually bid on a few, but I don't know what I'd do if I ever got one. I'd like to keep the Lincoln for a while.
FACT SHEET  All About The Continental
BASE PRICE -- In 1958, the two-door Mark III convertible cost $6,223. The last Continental made, the four-door 2002 model, was $38,755.
NUMBER OF LINCOLN-MERCURY DEALERS IN THE UNITED STATES -- 652.
NUMBERS PRODUCED -- Ford made 12,550 Lincoln Continental Mark III's in the 1958 model year; 6,927 Continentals were made for 2002.
COMPETITION -- In 1958, other luxury convertibles included the swoopy Cadillac Eldorado and the relatively restrained Chrysler Imperial.
THE COMPANY -- The Ford Motor Company bought the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922 to add a luxury counterpoint to Ford's nuts-and-bolts Model T. Edsel Ford created the company's first design department in 1938 and asked its head designer, Eugene Gregorie, for a car as continental as the ones he had seen in Europe. The 1939 Lincoln Continental received great acclaim. In 1955 Lincoln introduced the Mark series. In 2002 Ford retired the Continental name -- at least temporarily -- after a decline in sales.
CELEBRITY CACHET -- Continental owners over the years included Elvis Presley, Duke Ellington, the Shah of Iran and Frank Lloyd Wright, who called his 1940 model the most beautiful car ever made.
BIG-SCREEN APPEARANCES -- A white Continental appeared in ''North by Northwest,'' but black ones starred in two other films: Sonny Corleone is shot to death in a 1946 coupe in ''The Godfather,'' and the gang destroys a 1964 sedan in ''Animal House.''
FOR SALE -- The following vintage Continentals were for sale this week on eBay Motors: In Orlando, Fla., a black 1963 sedan with 85,000 miles and a ''buy it now'' price of $7,500; in Rialto, Calif., a 1965 turquoise sedan with 40,000 miles, suicide doors and a starting bid of $8,000; in Nashville, Tenn., a white 1959 Mark IV convertible with 65,000 miles and a starting bid of $12,800.
DRIVING  Correction:  February 6, 2004, Friday  An article last Friday about a man's affection for his 1958 Lincoln Continental Mark III convertible misstated the number of those convertibles made in that model year. It was 3,048, not 2,000. A related article, on the history of the Continental, misstated the number of 2002 Continentals made. It was 19,630 (6,927 was the number of 2002 models manufactured in calendar year 2001).
