To the Editor:
Re ''In Online Auctions, Misspelling in Ads Often Spells Cash'' (front page, Jan. 28):
I have long wondered if New York City shouldn't establish the position of commissioner of spelling.
Errors on signs, storefronts, menus and so on would all be subject to a fine, collectible on the spot. The misspelling would have to be either immediately corrected or completely erased, and the ''perp'' would have to attend classes as a prerequisite to performing community service in the spelling commissioner's department.
Proceeds from this project would be used to finance a highly successful spelling program, which has clearly fallen into disuse in schools and teacher training.
I am available for the position. Résumé on request (facility limited to English).
