To the Editor:
I got a kick out of your article about misspellings on eBay (front page, Jan. 28). It reminded me of the problems that my news-writing students encounter when they rely on a spelling checker instead of using a dictionary.
I can't count the number of times I've seen ''definitely'' misspelled as ''defiantly.'' One student wrote that a runner had to take time off for a pulled ''growing'' (groin) muscle.
But the all-time classic happened when an award-winning journalist visited our school. One student who covered the event for my class reported that the former newspaper editor had won the ''puller surprise.''
