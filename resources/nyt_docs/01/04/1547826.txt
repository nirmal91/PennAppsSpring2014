Agnes's Final Afternoon
An Essay on the Work
of Milan Kundera.
By François Ricard.
HarperCollins, $24.95.
Milan Kundera describes his spare and enigmatic fiction as ''holding on to only the essential.'' In ''Agnes's Final Afternoon,'' an imaginative literary essay, François Ricard probes the thematic unities and formal innovations of Kundera's novels to discover this essential. Like Agnes -- a character in Kundera's novel ''Immortality'' who takes a detour one afternoon to explore the landscape -- Ricard advocates abandoning theory to penetrate ''the very core of the oeuvre.'' Ricard, who teaches French literature at McGill University, argues that Kundera uses a principle of repetition and variation to compose novels that are ''always the same and yet always new, always evident and always elusive.'' Themes of displacement, slowness, resignation and emptiness reappear, but the essence of Kundera's fiction rests in its fusion of form and theme. Traditional linear narration is avoided in favor of ''inspirations, bifurcations, distractions.'' Kundera's novels mimic a stroll, a discursive promenade. Consequently, Ricard proposes, Kundera's central theme -- exile -- is ''not so much the thing it investigates as its very method of investigation.'' Though the arguments are at times rushed, Ricard's writing (ably translated from the French by Aaron Asher) is usually lithe and perceptive. Voluntary exile, Ricard notes with characteristic insight, allows Kundera's characters, like the form of the novel itself, to rediscover its ''inherent freedom.''
