Re ''Iran Thanks U.S. for Help, but Refrains From an Embrace'' (news article, Dec. 31):
You quote a political scientist from Tehran University as using the phrase ''earthquake diplomacy'' in talking about relations between the United States and Iran in the aftermath of the tragedy at Bam.
Indeed, how better to characterize the possibility that humanitarian concerns could begin to shake up the long-frozen relationship between two governments that should be talking with each other about the problems that divide them?
''Ping-pong diplomacy'' once helped vis-à-vis Beijing.
