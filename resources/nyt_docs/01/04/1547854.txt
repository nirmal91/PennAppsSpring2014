Let's hope spray-on stockings are better than their World War II predecessor, liquid stockings. Initiated in pre-nylon days when silk was needed for parachutes and stockings disappeared from stores, their brush-on application often left streaks and destroyed one budding romance when an unobservant fellow said to his date, ''Your stockings are wrinkled.''
