To the Editor:
As a citrus farmer in Florida who receives no federal subsidies for growing his crop, I read ''The Unkept Promise'' (editorial, ''Harvesting Poverty'' series, Dec. 30) with great interest.
Certainly there is a place for freer trade between developed and nondeveloped countries. In our industry, however, if the United States were to voluntarily eliminate the tariff on imported orange juice (90 percent of Florida orange juice is consumed in the United States), the huge Brazilian citrus industry would easily overwhelm the Florida growers because it doesn't have the minimum wage, child labor and environmental requirements that we have here.
