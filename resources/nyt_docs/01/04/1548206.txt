Local bus riders will have to fish for an extra dime starting today as bus fares go up throughout the state. A $1 local bus ride will increase to $1.10.
The fare increase affects riders in Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, New Britain, Bristol, Meriden and Wallingford.
It does not apply in Norwalk, Bridgeport, Danbury and other cities with independent transit districts.
''The fare increase will affect the majority of transit riders in Connecticut, but not all of them,'' said David Lee, general manager of CT Transit.
The bus system has not increased fares since 1995.
CT Transit had already imposed service reductions, reducing the frequency of its buses and eliminating a few stops altogether.
''We've done everything we can think of to cut costs,'' Mr. Lee said. ''This is one of several measures that have responded to the reality that costs are going up, ridership and revenue have been either flat or going down slightly and the state subsidy has not been able to grow fast enough to fill the gap.''
Starting next January, fares are expected to increase by another quarter.
