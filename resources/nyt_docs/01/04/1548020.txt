To the Editor:
Re ''Making Malpractice Harder to Prove'' (Money &amp; Medicine, Dec. 21), which discussed changes in rules regarding expert witness testimony:
The article described the heart-rending case in which a potential expert witness wrote: ''I have been informed by the senior neurosurgical society to discontinue expert testimony for plaintiffs or risk membership. Therefore I am withdrawing as your expert.''
That does not reflect the policy of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. The only members who have lost membership because of testimony were those who were found, after thorough investigation, to have testified inaccurately or fallaciously. If testimony is accurate, no neurosurgical expert need back out of a case for fear of reprisal.
Plaintiffs' experts who are members of the association have the same right to file a complaint against a member who testifies inaccurately for the defense. The reason only one plaintiff's case has been reviewed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons is that only one complaint has been filed against a defense expert.
