To the Editor:
Re ''What We Will Do in 2004,'' by Colin L. Powell (Op-Ed, Jan. 1):
If the Bush administration is resolved to ''expand freedom'' in 2004, it might start by suspending the proposed $13 million in military assistance to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
Given that human rights groups and the State Department itself have found little improvement in these countries' already poor human rights records, the United States' subsidy to these governments, which torture and repress their own people, should end.
