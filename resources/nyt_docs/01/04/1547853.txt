Hosiery in an aerosol can is a swell idea (Year in Ideas, Dec. 14). However it is not new. Just as many of us had gotten used to the grown-up feeling of wearing sexy silk stockings, along came World War II, and we were stuck having to find substitutes. Painting our legs with face makeup was the answer. And we substituted eyebrow pencil for back seams.
