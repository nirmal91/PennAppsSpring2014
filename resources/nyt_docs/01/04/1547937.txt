Winter is officially only two weeks under way, but people are already feeling its drying effects. Whether spooked by the toll taken by last year's long and deep freeze, or parched by an excess of holiday cocktails and central heating, shoppers are soaking up moisturizing creams, lotions and skin treatments designed to battle the elements. Here are some of the best new industrial-strength balms and treatments.
The very buttery Jurlique Lip Care Balm contains no petroleum products, only organic herbs and extracts. At $20 for a 0.3-ounce tube, the lip balm is also on the expensive side; www.jurlique.com.
