It is a dirty little secret of the bread industry that not all bagels are bagels. Sure, that puffy dough ring sold at your local bagel shop might seem like the real deal, but chances are it isn't. True bagels are dunked in boiling water before they are baked. Without this bath, a bagel is just a roll with a hole.
More and more bakeries are choosing to skip this labor-intensive step. But at Hoboken Hot Bagels, the 100-gallon kettles are still put to boil at 3 a.m. seven days a week, just as they have been for 20 years. Richard Wehr III, who took over the business from his father 10 years ago, wouldn't have it any other way. Only by boiling the bagels, he said, can you get ''that shiny chewiness on the outside -- others put them in rack ovens and get the shine but not the chewiness.''
Hoboken Hot Bagels offers standard issues like sesame, salt and plain (the best seller) to novelties like spinach cheddar and apple spice. The choice of spreads also runs the gamut, from regular and low-fat cream cheese ($1.35) to vegetable tofu spread ($2.05) to lox ($2.40). Bagels are prepared for the morning rush and then baked throughout the day as needed, so it is possible to get one straight from the oven.
On any given Saturday the shop sells upwards of 40 dozen bagels, which means one of two things: either the Atkins diet isn't that popular in Hoboken, or the bagels are so good that they're an indulgence worth making.
