It's fitting that the clash of the professional football titans, the Super Bowl, will take place in Houston, a city where sports has played a significant role in what many citizens call its rebirth. After the oil bust of the early 1980's, the world's energy capital set about diversifying, and sports is part of the plan.
The city on Buffalo Bayou has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a new football arena, Reliant Stadium, which opened in 2002; a modern baseball park that opened in 2000, Minute Maid Park; a National Football League franchise, the Houston Texans, which made its giddy debut in fall 2002 -- even winning four games; and a downtown multipurpose arena, Toyota Center, that opened in September as the home of Houston's professional basketball teams, the Rockets of the NBA and the Comets of the WNBA.
Houston plans to accompany the Super Bowl, to be played Feb. 1, with a lineup of cultural events before, during and after the weekend of the big game. Football fever spills into local museums, while extravagant exhibitions on pearls and chocolate explore more sensual obsessions.
Even though it's winter, butterflies flutter in a mock rain forest in the museum district and Houston's mild climate means it's still possible to dine outdoors on a sunny day, or walk along one of the many trails snaking through the city's sprawling parks.
Events
About 100,000 visitors are expected to pour into Houston the weekend of Super Bowl XXXVIII. About 70,000 of them will watch the game at Reliant Stadium, with its retractable roof, at Kirby Drive and Loop 610 next to the 1960's-era Astrodome. Tickets are difficult to find except through ticket brokers (at exorbitant prices). For information about hotels and transportation to the game, contact the Super Bowl hot line, (877) 904-6835, or visit www.visithoustontexas.com.
An easier and cheaper way to tap into Super Bowl spirit is through The N.F.L. Experience, an interactive theme park at the George R. Brown Convention Center, downtown at 1001 Avenida de Las Americas, about seven miles from the stadium. On the weekend before and on Super Bowl weekend, fans can test their football skills, play N.F.L. video games, shop for official merchandise and get autographs from pro stars. The park will be open Thursday through Sunday both weeks. Tickets are $15 and $10 for children under 12 from (866) 849-4635 or www.superbowl.com.
Super Bowl food goes way beyond chips and dips at the annual Taste of the N.F.L. on Jan. 31, a feast at Reliant Arena, next to the stadium, prepared by chefs from all 31 N.F.L. cities. Proceeds go to hunger relief organizations. Stephen Lewandowski of Tribeca Grill in New York will offer braised short rib and carmelized onion ravioli with truffled wild mushrooms, while Bruce Molzan of Ruggles Grill in Houston will dish up chipotle barbecue tenderloin of beef with red and green chimichurri. Food will be served from 7 to 9:30 p.m., followed by entertainment. Tickets are $400. Call (952) 835-7621 or www.tasteofthenfl.com.
Football and culture overlap at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1001 Bissonnet Street, (713) 639-7300, www.mfah.org. Through Feb. 8, ''First Down Houston: The Birth of an N.F.L. Franchise'' documents the inaugural season of the Texans from start to finish. Robert Clark's 86 black-and-white photographs capture team meetings and practices, and shots of fans, including the winner of the team's Ultimate Fan contest, who is dressed like a Texans version of Elvis. The museum's extensive permanent collection is centered on Renaissance, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Closed Monday, except holidays. General admission is $7, free on Thursday.
Famous pieces of jewelry, like the necklace that Joe DiMaggio gave his bride Marilyn Monroe are among the objects in ''Pearls: a Natural History,'' at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, One Hermann Circle Drive; (713) 639-4629, www.hmns.org. The exhibition, through Jan. 18, examines the history, harvesting and formation of pearls. One of the most spectacular pieces is a 1904 chrysanthemum brooch made of elongated freshwater pearls and diamonds that once belonged to Lillian Russell. Admission is $12.50. From Valentine's Day to May 9, ''Chocolate: The Exhibition'' takes a similar close look at another, more affordable indulgence. Admission is $10.50.
Also worth seeing are the science museum's permanent exhibits of dinosaur skeletons and its butterfly center, inside a cone-shaped greenhouse, where waterfalls splash and hundreds of butterflies flutter about.

Where to Eat
Only 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, Houston is a city of seafood restaurants. A reigning master is Mark Holley, the chef at Pesce, 3029 Kirby Drive at West Alabama, (713) 522-4858, in the River Oaks area.

Appetites for beef run big in Houston, which accounts for the abundance of steakhouses. Prime cuts top the menu at Brenner's Steakhouse, 10911 Katy Freeway, (713) 465-2901, a fixture since 1936. The dining room, with the rustic feel of a lodge, looks onto a landscaped garden with streams and waterfalls. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $100. Lunch Tuesday to Friday, dinner daily.
You can get away from the urban landscape at Goode Company Barbeque, 5109 Kirby Drive; (713) 522-2530.
