Two F.B.I. agents who exposed the corruption scandal in Bridgeport stepped down this week, including the supervisor of the investigation.
Robert J. Marston, who opened the case that led to the conviction of former Mayor Joseph P. Ganim and later supervised the investigation, has accepted a job as manager of security services with Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft in East Hartford. Edward Adams (below), who headed up the day-to-day operations on the case, including an extensive wiretapping operation, is also leaving the agency. He planned to open a private investigation firm with a former police detective.
Mr. Marston, a 26-year F.B.I. veteran, made a name for himself within the agency before coming to Connecticut. He got Alphonse D'Arco, the acting head of the Lucchese crime family, to cooperate with investigators.
The Ganim case was a different kind of test. The operation has already resulted in the conviction of 11 people and is one of the most extensive and elaborate public corruption cases in Connecticut.
''It was really sort of unprecedented, in terms of the amount of time, amount of resources used, and the investigative techniques utilized,'' Mr. Marston said. ''Once we unraveled it, we showed just how pervasive the corruption here was.''
Mr. Marston and Mr. Adams set up wiretaps in restaurants and in the car of Paul Pinto, Mr. Ganim's bagman, and then used Mr. Pinto to build their case. Eventually, the agents, along with officers from other agencies, revealed that the mayor was at the center of the scandal, trading bribes for contracts.
Mr. Ganim is serving nine years in prison.
