An article on Dec. 21 about the prevalence of standing ovations for Broadway productions misidentified a costume designer in a quotation from the theater historian Ethan Mordden. Mr. Mordden says he referred to Bob Mackintosh, designer for productions including ''Mame'' -- not Bob Mackie -- in a comment about star vehicles for women. Thus the quotation should have read: ''When everyone's attention is focused, the star comes out in her 37th Bob Mackintosh gown of the evening. By that point, you have no choice but get to your feet.''
