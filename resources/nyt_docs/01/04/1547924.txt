To the Editor:
Your round-table chat about the ''lows'' of the classical music scene in 2003 [Dec. 28] contained characteristically snooty swipes at the New York Philharmonic's subscription audience. Subscribers should be praised for their commitment to the arts, not panned because they may disagree with a music critic's taste. Let's not ask which the arts could use more of: subscribers or critics.
