To the Editor:
Regarding the County Lines column by Marek Fuchs, ''The Hired Hand (At Top Dollar)'' (Dec. 21): I'm glad I live in Croton-on-Hudson, which benefits immeasurably from a professional village manager, rather than Brewster, where Mayor John Cesar's well-intentioned but amateur efforts undoubtedly cost the taxpayers much more than the salary of a village manager.
Professional village and city managers typically spend long hours making local government work. They help deliver a broad array of efficient, effective services: policing, fire protection, parks and recreation, highways and sidewalks, building permits, clean and reliable water, etc. They run enterprises of tens of millions of dollars, and do so for far less than their private counterparts. They are well trained, nonpartisan and knowledgeable about the best practices their municipalities might advantageously adopt. Without their expertise it would be much more difficult, and much more expensive, for businesses to operate and citizens to enjoy a high quality of life.
The profession of municipal management was created precisely because elected officials typically had neither the time nor the technical skills to help government function at the low tax levels demanded by the public.
Professor Behn is correct that we need managerial pros to minimize corruption. Rye's City Manager, Paul Shew, is correct that we need professional expertise. The alternative is only poor, even chaotic, performance. There are no simple solutions to municipal problems, but there are careful, professional approaches that have more than proved their worth. The citizens of Westchester -- many of whom are themselves professionals -- deserve no less than professional municipal management.
