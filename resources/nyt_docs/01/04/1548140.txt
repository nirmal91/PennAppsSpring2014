To the Editor:
Re ''The Unkept Promise'' (editorial, ''Harvesting Poverty'' series, Dec. 30):
Your ''Harvesting Poverty'' series has clearly laid out how American agricultural policies have enriched a handful of American farmers and marketers while impoverishing millions worldwide.
These policies tend to cause overproduction in this country at great environmental expense and to the detriment of smaller family farmers, who are rapidly disappearing despite the federal largess ostensibly intended to protect them.
More than our relations with the world is at stake. Our agricultural policies are impoverishing our future as well.
