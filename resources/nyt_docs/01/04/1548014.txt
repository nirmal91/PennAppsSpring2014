To the Editor:
I'm shocked! An article that acknowledges the existence of knitters over the age of 29 (''Down to the Sea in Knitting Needles,'' Dec. 28)?
With the constant media emphasis on the young hip urban knitter and idiotic comments such as ''knitting is not just for grandma anymore,'' the focus on older knitters is most welcomed.
