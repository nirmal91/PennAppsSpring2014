I'm something of an optimist myself, so when I read Sella's article, I recalled a quote from Gandhi: ''First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win.'' I'm sure Kucinich is familiar with this quotation, and so your article must be an encouraging sign to him that his campaign for president has progressed far into the ridicule phase. Can victory be far behind?
