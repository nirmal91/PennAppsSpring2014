I'm a senior, a white male, a small-business owner who doesn't belong to any of the fringe groups mentioned in your article. I have looked into Kucinich's background, seen him in person three times and looked at what he stands for in some depth. What has made me a passionate admirer of him and what he stands for I have learned in spite of the news media. I certainly didn't get anything worthwhile from your article. A few snickers, maybe.
