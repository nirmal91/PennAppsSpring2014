It's going to be a busy year for Pete Correll, the self-proclaimed ''King of Toilet Paper'' and chief executive of Georgia-Pacific. Early this year, Mr. Correll's company will bring out new versions of two of its well-known products, Quilted Northern toilet paper and Brawny paper towels. As Mr. Correll attends product introductions and other events promoting the changes, he says, he is always asked the same question: ''How does it feel to sell toilet paper for a living?''
''It never fails,'' he said. ''Somebody, somewhere is bound to ask me that question in the course of the day.''
Mr. Correll's stock answer: ''Toilet paper is a wonderful product. Ninety-eight percent of the American public uses it.'' As to what the other 2 percent may be using instead, Mr. Correll said he had no clue. ''We don't have any research on that,'' he said.
