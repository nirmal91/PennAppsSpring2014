Winter is officially only two weeks under way, but people are already feeling its drying effects. Whether spooked by the toll taken by last year's long and deep freeze, or parched by an excess of holiday cocktails and central heating, shoppers are soaking up moisturizing creams, lotions and skin treatments designed to battle the elements. Here are some of the best new industrial-strength balms and treatments.
Raw, chapped hands will find succor in Kiehl's new Ultimate Strength Hand Salve. The heavy-duty cream ($18 for 5 ounces; $11 for 2.5) was made to condition skin while forming a protective barrier against moisture loss. Although the first shipment sold out quickly, new supplies are arriving this week (800-543-4571).
