Your feature brought back memories of New York in the early 1950's, when only bars and movie theaters had air-conditioning. After your shower, you rubbed a tan lotion on your legs, drew a stocking seam with an eyebrow pencil, pulled on your white cotton gloves and were ready to go to work. Spray-on would have been nice.
