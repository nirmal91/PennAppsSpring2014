Times Square may still draw Manhattan's biggest crowds on New Year's Eve, but Dan Flannery, general manager of the two Ritz-Carlton hotels in New York City, continued his efforts this year to create a rival event downtown. For the second year in a row, the Ritz-Carlton New York at Battery Park helped sponsor midnight fireworks at the Statue of Liberty. It also offered special packages for its guests.
Those who stayed in rooms with views of Lady Liberty received Champagne and CD's with instructions on what time to play them, so that the music, featuring crooners like Frank Sinatra, would be in sync with the pyrotechnics.
The biggest attraction, however, was in the hotel's bar: an Army soldier, who was scheduled to ship off for Iraq on Saturday, married his fianc√©e at the stroke of midnight.
Mr. Flannery, who has seen the ball drop in Times Square several times, watched the nuptials, a glass of Champagne in hand.
''It sounded a lot more fun than being pinned up against thousands of other people in 30-degree weather,'' he said.
