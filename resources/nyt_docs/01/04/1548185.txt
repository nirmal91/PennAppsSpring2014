Before his swearing-in on Jan. 1, Steve Levy, the first Democrat to be elected Suffolk's county executive in 14 years, appointed two chief deputies, the first time that title has been held simultaneously by two people.
Kevin S. Law, named chief counsel and administrator of all county departments, was the managing partner of Nixon Peabody's office in Garden City, chairman of Mr. Levy's transition team and an assistant county executive under the last Democrat to lead the county, Patrick Halpin. Paul Sabatino II, who will develop policy, approve contracts and act as a link to other governments, was counsel to the Suffolk Legislature for the past 19 years.
Mr. Levy chose Christine Malafi, 37, for county attorney, making her the first woman and the youngest person to hold that position. He also re-established the management unit of the county executive's office, eliminated in the early 1990's, to help keep a tight rein on spending. Fredrick Pollert, director of the Legislature's budget review office for the past 14 years, is now the deputy county executive in charge of management and finance.
Deputy county executives are not subject to legislative confirmation. The county attorney and commissioner-level appointees require the Legislature's approval.
Mr. Levy took office without choosing a health commissioner, a communications director or a lobbyist to carry his agenda to Albany.
