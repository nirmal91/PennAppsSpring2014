Come Christmas, food banks are stocked with goodies. Drives at schools and supermarkets fill the shelves. But the directors of two Connecticut food banks want to remind donors not to forget the hungry now that the holidays are over.
Of the 12 million pounds of food distributed by the Connecticut Food Bank every year, about 800,000 pounds are targeted for Thanksgiving, said Nancy L. Carrington, executive director of the Connecticut Food Bank, which oversees food distribution in six counties. While some of those donations spill over into December, the spike is pretty dramatic, Ms. Carrington said. And every spike leads to a dip. She said food donations have already slowed.
''Around now, they just stop,'' Ms. Carrington said, referring to food drives held by churches and other organizations. ''People are doing them specifically for Thanksgiving and year-end holidays. Once those are gone, that's it.''
When food drives fade away, the food banks depend more heavily on manufacturers.
Kate Lombardo (above), executive director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County in Stamford, stressed that the public needs to change its perception of hunger.
''I don't think people understand the concept of hunger,'' Ms. Lombardo said. ''If a person cannot provide themselves with a holiday meal, it's only rational to assume that probably other times of the year they'll have problems providing food for their needs.''
