To the Editor:
Being from a farm state, I read your Dec. 30 editorial on farm subsidies with some interest. You present some laudable goals in helping third world countries survive, but the problem is with the execution.
If we remove subsidies and do nothing else, it will make things for third world farmers, and indeed our own small farms, even worse. Archer Daniels Midland and other mega-corporations that can afford to buy and sell $2 wheat will simply make less profit for a time until they control everything.
