A Parisian court of appeals ruled in 1934 that a woman's hat was a work of art worthy of copyright protection. In the lavishly illustrated SHOCKING! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli (Philadelphia Museum of Art/ Yale University, $65), Dilys E. Blum, the curator of costume and textiles at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, persuasively argues that Schiaparelli was an artist no less than a designer -- and not only because of her collaborations with Dal√≠, Cocteau and Man Ray. Her Spanish rival, Balenciaga, considered Schiaparelli ''the only real artist in the couture.'' From the presentation of her first collection in 1927 to the closing of her salon in 1954, the Italian-born designer ''was quick to adapt to new trends and seemingly fearless when it came to trying new things.'' The perpetually innovative Schiaparelli introduced a multitude of items now taken for granted in fashion. She invented the wraparound dress, designed fashion eyewear, created the first designer boutique and made fashionable the use of synthetic fabrics, like rayon. By 1932, she had 400 employees producing 7,000 to 8,000 garments a year in eight different ateliers. But World War II would prove devastating to her empire: in October 1940, Schiaparelli was compelled to reduce her workforce to 150. Along with Blum's informative chapters, the captions for several hundred illustrations include interesting tidbits of their own; for example, that in lieu of journeying to Paris for her fittings, Mae West sent a plaster cast of her figure.
