To the Editor:
Re ''The Smoking Ban: Clear Air, Murky Economics'' (front page, Dec. 28): Although New York City's smoking ban took effect in only March, one early economic trend is encouraging. New York's bars and restaurants paid the city 12 percent more in business taxes in the months since the ban began than they did in the corresponding six-month period in 2002.
From April through September of 2002, the Department of Finance collected $10.8 million in general corporation and unincorporated business taxes from bars and restaurants. From April through September of 2003, the department collected $12 million from those businesses.
These statistics are far less important than the number of lives that will be saved, but they are a good indication that New Yorkers are adjusting quite well to the smoking ban.
