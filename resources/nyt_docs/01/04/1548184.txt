Richard Bravman, the chief executive and interim chairman of Symbol Technologies of Holtsville, resigned those positions on Tuesday, acknowledging that he inflated profits and revenues as a rising executive at the company during the spring of 2001.
Mr. Bravman said he participated in ''premature recognition'' of $860,000 in revenue.
A protégé of Jerome Swartz, who founded Symbol but resigned in July under the same cloud, Mr. Bravman was replaced by William Nuti, the company's president and chief operating officer. Salvatore Iannuzzi, the company's lead independent director and a former Securities and Exchange Commission official, was named non-executive chairman.
Symbol, which manufactures bar-code technology and mobile computing products, is under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission for the manner in which it handled its accounting between 1998 and 2001.
Also on Tuesday, Symbol restated its financial performance for those years, cancelling more than $234.2 million in revenue and $324.7 million in profits. The company said it plans to release other delayed financial information, including its performance for the first three quarters of 2003, within a couple of weeks.
