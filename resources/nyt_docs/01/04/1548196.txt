To the Editor:
Regarding ''A Lesson Learned, and Passed On'' (Soapbox, Dec. 7):
I've always wanted to help the hungry, not just with a contribution here or with a few cans of tuna there, but to really give of myself and help. Reading Betty Konopko's article gave me the impetus to do just that. I called a local organization, the Interfaith Emergency Food Pantry, and my 6-year-old son and I will attend their next meeting. I will pack the groceries and Michael will read the expiration dates on the packages. Thank you and your mother for your inspiration.
