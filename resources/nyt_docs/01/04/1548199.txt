To the Editor:
You quote Ralph Siegel of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (Voices, Dec. 21) observing that 2003 was "a rough year" for abused children. Indeed, with 37 deaths and more unspeakable suffering, we desperately need to find answers.
One response could be that all New Jerseyans decide to celebrate International Children's Day on June 1, 2004. This tradition began in Geneva in 1925 and has been celebrated for years in many countries.
My town has celebrated for the last three years and will continue the tradition. No money is required because no presents or gifts or products are involved. You simply dedicate existing activities to the honor and well-being of children everywhere.
In Summit, grade-school students exchange their artwork with children in San Francisco, Washington, England, India, Romania and more. The art is displayed for all to see, and the local-access station films the festivities.
As the world becomes more global, International Children's Day offers a special moment we can easily give our children and ourselves every year. The nay-sayers believe every day is children's day. If that is true, why are so many children abused and neglected?
