IF your New Year's resolutions include world travel but you would really rather stay close to home, there is a simple solution. Expand your horizon, restaurant by restaurant, in the Garden State. Within the state's borders, you can feast on roasted halal-prescribed meats, Key lime pie, steamed mussels in white-wine broth, seafood and pine nuts in lettuce, a porterhouse steak for two, house-cured salmon, peanut butter ice cream and monk fish stew with tofu. From Italian to Korean, Thai to Middle Eastern, the world on your plate awaits.
Here are summaries of published reviews of restaurants that our critics, Karla Cook and David Corcoran, rated excellent, very good and good in 2003. Because restaurants are ever-evolving, however, changes may have occurred in menus, chefs and management since the date of the review. This list, which was compiled by Ms. Cook, should be used as a guide, not as a gospel.
EXCELLENT
FASCINO 331 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair; (973)233-0350. Serious, even artful cooking from Ryan DePersio, who notes Italian, French and new American antecedents while serving up a side of fun. Seafood is flawless and intelligently paired: branzino with risotto cake, gremolata and cauliflower purée; John Dory with braised escarole and cherry tomatoes; and porcini-dusted sea scallops with farro risotto and bell pepper juice. The pastry chef is Mr. DePersio's mother, Cynthia; her signature creation is a buttery apple crostata with intense flavor complemented by a scoop of cinnamon gelato. There is a sense of the speakeasy about the place, with its faceless facade and smoked-glass door, but everyone is family to Mr. DePersio and his relatives who help out here. Bring your own wine. Main dishes, $20 to $29. D.C. 12/14/03.
RESTAURANT SERENADE 6 Roosevelt Avenue, Chatham; (973)701-0303. Highly seasonal French- and Asian-inspired menu in one of the state's most opulent and inviting dining spaces, where the pronunciation is French (seh-re-NAHD), the conversation purrs like a Lexus and the prices are no longer a bargain. (For lower prices, snag unreserved seating in the cozy bar.) Best bets include Maine oysters, endive salad, juniper-crusted venison with sweet potato purée, filet mignon, rack of lamb, wild mushrooms, John Dory, king salmon, barramundi, yellowfin tuna, Linzer torte and sorbets. But skip the overbreaded crab cakes, the overly salty honey-glazed grilled shrimp and the ungenerous cheese plate. Diamond-studded wine list. Main dishes, $26 to $35. D.C. 3/16/03.
XAVIAR'S 506 Piermont Avenue, Piermont, N.Y.; (845)359-7007. A Parisian jewel box of a white-glove restaurant that feels formal and a little stiff but offers colorful and beautifully balanced dishes with seasonal, flawless ingredients. Peter Xavier Kelly, a self-taught chef influenced by the nouvelle cuisine pioneers Paul Bocuse and Alain Chapel, uses French recipes with Asian and Mediterranean accents. Try asparagus with morels, shaved asparagus salad, calamari salad, foie gras, braised short ribs, skate wing, red snapper, Pekin duck with foie gras, veal medallions, Pacific ahi tuna, rack of lamb, walnut parfait and Grand Marnier soufflé. And save room for petits fours afterward. Encyclopedic wine list with 800 entries. Four-course dinner, $60. D.C. 6/01/03.
VERY GOOD
BLACK DUCK ON SUNSET 1 Sunset Boulevard, West Cape May; (609)898-0100. This younger sibling of the fussier Union Park restaurant in the Hotel Macomber, with whitewashed walls, open dining rooms and a tension-reducing atmosphere, sets the stage for J. Christopher Hubert's ambitious, well-balanced dishes often featuring Asian ingredients and techniques. There is also unembarrassed fun food -- a pu pu platter with chicken wings, ribs, spring rolls and dumplings. Try beef spring rolls, lobster bisque, orange-almond salad, panko goat cheese with arugula, seafood over red-pepper risotto, lobster with monkfish, seared tuna, roasted chicken and apple spice cake. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $18 to $30. D.C. 8/03/03.
DE ANNA'S on Lilly, around the corner from 18 Main Street, Lambertville; (609)397-8957. Don't be fooled. Around the corner from the actual address of this dark and battened-down place is a comfortable 49-seat place with pillows against the banquettes. Masterfully made pasta, reasonable sauces and deliciously fresh ingredients are basic components of Diana Menzel's cute homestyle restaurant that she named after herself (with Italian pronunciation). Dishes, mostly seasonal specialties, build on those she learned from her grandmother. Don't miss the antipasto, the blue cheese salad, absolutely any pasta with any sauce, soft-shell crabs, strawberry gelato and ricotta cheesecake. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $14 to $20. K.C. 8/24/03.
DORIS &amp; ED'S 348 Shore Drive, Highlands; (732)872-1565. Creatively playful food drawing on classic and newly popular combinations are the strength of Russell Dare, executive chef, and the mission of Jim Filip, owner, wine master and driving force at the restaurant for the last 25 years. Try bouillabaisse, tuna tartare, any oyster on the half-shell, sashimi of tuna, house-smoked salmon, crab cake, grouper marinated in miso, berry shortcake, Key lime pie and crème caramel. Carefully selected wine list with many California Chardonnays. Main dishes, $22 to $35. K.C. 5/18/03.
MARCO &amp; PEPE 289 Grove Street, Jersey City; (201)860-9688. A squat two-story building harbors up-to-date culinary intelligence and showcases the fresh, energetic work of Ian Topper-Kapitan, a veteran of the Ryland Inn, JoJo and Vong. Eclectic but focused, the chef finds inspiration in American, French, Italian and Spanish techniques and ingredients to create an ever-changing menu. Recommended dishes include watercress salad, warm goat cheese salad, onion tart, chopped steak burger, risotto, pan-seared diver scallops, pan-roasted halibut, duck confit, macaroni and cheese, lemon tart, gelatos and a fine, well-balanced cheese plate that would ably accompany many on a list of after-dinner drinks. Short wine list with flair. Main dishes, $15 to $25. D.C. 4/13/03.
MIDORI 3130 Route 10, Denville; (973)537-8588. The menu at this Japanese place is full of unexpected, bizarrely named pleasures: the Christmas roll and the dragon roll, the crazy eel and the crazy tuna, the Montauk and the carousel and the volcano. Authentic they aren't; they represent a blending of cultures, an adaptation of the Japanese passion for freshness and jewel-like design to the American passion for the new and the different. Ordinary Japanese dishes are forgettable. But the sushi is terrific, every bit of it. Décor is charmless and heavy on kitsch; the staff is friendly and accommodating. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $11 to $26. D.C. 3/2/03.
NOUVEAU SUSHI 635 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair; (973)746-9608. Extraordinarily fresh and beautiful dishes with depth derive from the energy and confidence of Freddie Wong, late of Nobu, and Steven Wong, who learned his craft with a traditional sushi chef. The menu makes few concessions to inexperience, but it's hard to go wrong with this mostly Japanese landscape that includes several kinds of fish flown in from the mother country. Try the tri-colored seaweed salad, pot stickers so delicate as to be almost graceful, brilliantly executed ceviche with cilantro and red onion, yellowtail with Serrano peppers, the omakase (a succession of appetizer-size dishes) and the green tea tiramisù. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $6.75 to $20. D.C. 9/14/03.
OSTERIA DANTE 91 Broad Street, Red Bank; (732)530-0602. Venice on the wall, aprons on the waiters and reassuringly familiar, well-prepared Tuscan dishes star at Mike Bitici's remake of a former pizzeria in Monmouth County. The new venture marks his comeback from the demise of Grand Ticino, a Greenwich Village fixture. Since he does much of the shopping, he is the one to thank for the amazingly fine veal chop. Other winners include pear salad, arugula with beets and Gorgonzola, tuna carpaccio, marinated salmon, spinach ravioli, farro with wild mushrooms, seafood marechiara, branzino, grilled squid, cheesecake, zabaglione. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $19 to $32. D.C. 5/11/03.
PANICO'S 103 Church Street, New Brunswick; (732)545-6100. Satisfying mix of traditional and luxurious ingredients blend with the light, the peach-toned décor and the mirrored walls to coddle you and remind you that warm weather will return. Minimalism makes no appearance here -- portions are generous, there is the theater of tableside boning, and truffles are just another fungus. Best bets include sweet pepper soup with chanterelle mushrooms, grilled calamari, sweet sausage with escarole and cannelini, seafood salad, square-cut pasta with seafood, pumpkin ravioli, turbot with fava beans, pear-ginger cobbler, banana financier. Interesting. pricey selection of Italian reds and whites. Main dishes, $23.50 to $32.50. K.C. 1/26/03.
LE PETIT CHATEAU 121 Claremont Road, Bernardsville; (908)766-4544. This dim, understated dining room lights up with the food of Scott Cutaneo, who practiced his art at Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan before decamping in 1996. Energetic and highly accomplished dishes are almost always worth the wait, though annoying blind alleys sometimes crop up on the wine list and the menu -- spinach instead of vegetable timbale, for instance. Best bets include foie gras with strawberries, Pacific shrimp with portobello mushrooms, ahi tuna tartare, asparagus with morels, glazed vegetables, potato-crusted turbot, French-cut chicken breast, braised short ribs. Long and expensive wine list. Main dishes, $23 to $32. D.C. 6/8/03.
SAGAMI 37 West Crescent Boulevard, Collingswood; (856)854-9773. This is a rustic place with low ceilings and high noise that falls away as dish after dish of delicacy, raw and not, appears. In business since 1974, Shigeru Fukuyoshi and his wife, Chizuko, have had years to practice their juxtaposition of tastes, textures and temperatures to achieve sublime sushi, tantalizing tempura and excellent eel. Try clear soup, cold bean curd, beef scallion roll, edamame, green seaweed salad, fried eggplant with chicken-bean paste, any sashimi, any sushi, tempura, broiled eel on rice and green tea ice cream. B.Y.O. Dinners, $16 to $26.50. K.C. 11/2/03.
SEVEN HILLS OF ISTANBUL 441 Raritan Avenue, Highland Park; (732)777-9711. This is the American version of a 20-year-old institution that Hasan Gedelec and his wife, Nilgun, moved from Istanbul when they immigrated to the United States. The chef turns out beautifully roasted halal-prescribed meats, and the coffee is seductive, but despite the sumptuous menu, there is no seafood. Best bets include red lentil soup, feta cheese, cold appetizer sampler plate, fried calf or lamb liver with onions, rolled filo pastry filled with feta cheese and parsley, any roasted meat platter, bottom-of-the-pot pudding roll and Turkish coffee. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $13.50 to $22.50. K.C. 4/20/03.
SUNNY GARDEN 15 Farber Road, Princeton; (609)520-1881. Yu-Lien Yen, who immigrated from Taiwan in 1976 and found himself in the restaurant business after a brief partnership with his brother, offers fresh Asian food that is not traditional or typical. This is not your neighborhood Chinese takeout. Best bets include any sushi created by Alex Ren, the longtime sushi chef, as well as scallion pancakes, seafood and pine nuts in lettuce cups, fried meat dumplings, soft-shell crabs in any sauce, simmered Chinese okra with clams, sea bass with teriyaki and wasabi, and creaky chicken. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $5.50 to $29.50. K.C. 10/19/03.
TAPAS DE ESPAÑA 7909 Bergenline Avenue, North Bergen; (201)453-1690. Take a crowd and order expansively and you will make it only partway through a vast menu here that holds myriad treasures from all corners of Spain. Plan to make a meal on appetizers, but skip the stuffed mushrooms and chicken croquettes. Don't miss the smoky grilled calamari with undertones of lemon and herbs, the bean soup with chorizo and Swiss chard, a revelation of a Spanish omelet with onion and peppers and the shrimp with garlic. As for main dishes, the paella marinera is well above average, and the roast lamb and potatoes dark, crisp-tender and satisfying. Well-chosen Spanish-accented wine list. Main dishes, $12 to $27. D.C. 1/5/03.
THAI NAM PHET 296 Route 46 East, Rockaway; (973)627-8400. Some of the best Thai food in the state is offered here in a small, ordinary-looking restaurant along a dreary stretch of highway. Though not adventurous, every dish is lively and exacting, as befits Samarn Pecharatubtim's long years of research before he opened his own place with his cousin, Deth Srisonti, as chef. It's also pure; don't expect to substitute chicken for the traditional beef in massaman curry. Try tender and clean steamed mussels in fragrant white-wine broth with hot pepper, basil and lemongrass; crisp bites of duck with red onion, tomato, peppers, cashew and pineapple; chicken in yellow curry, green papaya with garlic, pepper and lime juice. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $7 to $18. D.C. 8/31/03.
WOO JEON RESTAURANT 411 U.S. Route 1, Edison; (732)572-6100. Bodacious barbecue, hot from the grill sunk in the middle of the table, is a big draw, but the menu here is also full of the spice-laden, heat-bearing bright renditions of Korean food created by Meensu Choi. Recommendations include every dish of kimchi, mung bean pancake, fried meat and vegetable dumplings, abalone with rice porridge, marinated beef ribs for barbecue, shredded beef with scallions in spicy broth, monk fish stew with tofu, spicy lamb stew with sesame leaves and bibim bap, a homey concoction of steamed rice, marinated beef, vegetables and a fried egg. B.Y.O. Barbecues, $15 to $18; hot pots, $29 to $33. K.C. 5/25/03.
ZOE'S BY THE LAKE 112 Tomahawk Trail, Sparta; (973)726-7226. Brawny flavors and seasonal ingredients mark the vigorous French country cooking of Scott Jacobson, formerly with René Pujol in the Theater District of Manhattan. The owners, Jean-Charles and Marla Saben, transformed a former beer and pizza joint into an airy space that looks out onto what once was a lake but is now a Monet meadow come to life. Main courses are generous and well composed, without the self-consciousness that cries out ''haute.'' Best bets are the house-cured salmon, crab cakes, sweetbreads, grilled fish, Chambord soufflé, lemon tart, cheese tasting and chocolate sampler. Short, well-chosen wine list. Main dishes, $20 to $29. D.C. 8/17/03.

B.Y.O. Main dishes, $5 to $8. K.C. 11/23/03.
BOMBAY GRILL &amp; BISTRO 371 George Street, New Brunswick; (732)247-7474. Slivered okra, mushrooms stuffed with vegetables and a biryani casserole sealed with naan and baked are among the offerings here. But eat early to miss the thudding from the bar downstairs. B.Y.O. Main dishes, $10 to $30. K.C. 12/21/03.
CHICK AND NELLO'S HOMESTEAD INN 800 Kuser Road, Trenton; (609)890-9851. This eccentric place with no menu offers homey dishes including salt-cod salad, chops of many varieties, roast chicken, lima beans with tomato sauce and peanut butter ice cream. Wine list. Main dishes, $13 to $28. K.C. 1/19/03.

FROMAGERIE 26 Ridge Road, Rumson; (732)842-8088.

HUNAN COTTAGE 14 Route 46 (eastbound), Fairfield; (973)808-8328.

JANICE 23 Sheridan Avenue, Ho Ho Kus; (201)445-2666. This converted luncheonette is so outgoing that it could run for mayor.

MARCO-POLO'S SECRET 206 Rock Road, Glen Rock; (201)612-1188. Ignore the regular menu and hope that Sing Kan Yeung, the owner, is your waiter so your experience here is not ordinary.
