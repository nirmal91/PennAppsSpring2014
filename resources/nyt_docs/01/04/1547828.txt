THE BRASS WALL
The Betrayal
of Undercover Detective #4126.
By David Kocieniewski.
Holt, $25.
Crime takes as many forms as David Kocieniewski's cast in ''The Brass Wall,'' a gripping story that travels from the mob-infested Bronx neighborhood of Throgs Neck to the upper tiers of the Police Department. The connection is a tenacious and wily undercover detective, identified by the alias Vincent Armanti. In 1993, Armanti was masquerading as Vinnie (Blue Eyes) Penisi in an undercover operation aimed at Jack and Mario Ferranti -- brothers, mob associates and suspects in an arson that killed a fireman in 1992. During the investigation, Armanti realized his cover had been blown by a fellow detective. Armanti desperately tried to salvage the case while fending off well-placed fears about getting killed. The police officer who betrayed him, John Wrynn, was a Throgs Neck resident with a middling career and a powerful father, a veteran of the Internal Affairs Division. Armanti, furious at the nearly fatal betrayal, pursued investigations against the Ferrantis and the Wrynns but discovered frighteningly similar tribal loyalties. The book is revelatory about the blurry line between the good and bad guys. Kocieniewski, a reporter at The New York Times, deftly reports a complex, heavily researched story and, even with asides into the history of Throgs Neck and Internal Affairs, the book speeds along with intensity. Throughout, Armanti's isolation is harrowing. Mob suspects called his home and nearly kidnapped his nephew; he was also prey for Police Department politicos who wanted to silence him. Armanti ultimately was partly victorious but ''when he thought about the future, all he saw were the shadows.''
