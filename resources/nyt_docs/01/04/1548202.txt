Four years after its creation, the Jandon Scholarship program, a private-public partnership, has produced its first college graduate: Deyci Rodriguez Mejia, 22, of White Plains, who received a bachelor's degree this month from Manhattanville College. Two Harrison residents, Jane and Donald Cecil, in conjunction with the county, started the program in 1999 to help high school graduates from poor families in Westchester.
So far, 50 students have been chosen to receive the four-year college scholarships of up to $10,000, with the Cecils donating more than $1 million over all. To be eligible, a student must attend a public high school in Westchester and be a member of a family with an income below the county's poverty level. For further information and income guidelines, call 995-6434 or contact a public school guidance counselor. The program, which has chosen 12 students a year until now, will expand that number to 15 a year, the County Executive's office has announced.
Ms. Rodriguez, a 2000 graduate of Sleepy Hollow High School, majored in psychology and is certified to teach elementary education, the county said. She plans to pursue a master's degree in special education and literacy while teaching.
