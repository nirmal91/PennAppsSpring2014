To the Editor:
It is easy to cast aspersions on Newark Airport's monorail designs on vertical transportation (Soapbox, Dec. 14), yet there is sound rationale for including only one platform elevator and disallowing baggage carts beyond the ground floor.
Provision of a single elevator has more to do with the platform width and nothing to do with disregard of special-needs travelers. Considering that the actual escalator and elevator ''sleeves'' occupy considerable area, that platform edge clearance is needed and that additional unobstructed space is needed for maintenance equipment, it would be unreasonable to accommodate a second platform elevator.
Moreover, baggage carts are not allowed on the platform because their presence would constitute a considerable hazard in emergency scenarios, and could create havoc to expeditious egress. And monorail cars do not have sufficient space for such devices. Thus, there is a literal line drawn at the ground floor to prevent ''SmartCart incursions.''
