Winter is officially only two weeks under way, but people are already feeling its drying effects. Whether spooked by the toll taken by last year's long and deep freeze, or parched by an excess of holiday cocktails and central heating, shoppers are soaking up moisturizing creams, lotions and skin treatments designed to battle the elements. Here are some of the best new industrial-strength balms and treatments.
To soothe winter-weary complexions, Fresh created Repair and Restore Face Balm ($95 an ounce). But Cr√®me Ancienne, the company's highest-end face cream, now has an even richer texture and is purportedly handmade in small batches in a monastery, perhaps to ensure the purity of content and character ($250 for 3.5 ounces; Fresh.com).
Origins takes a less monastic approach with Never Say Dry, a dense protective face salve. The face-saver has traces of fragrant orange, peppermint and apricot ($29.50 for 1.7 ounces; www.origins.com).
