To the Editor:
In keeping out of sight at his ranch (news article, Jan. 1), President Bush seems to be fulfilling his role as the anti-Clinton. While I understand his need for privacy, both it and ''executive privilege'' have morphed into secrecy.
Despite Bill Clinton's faults, I liked vicariously shopping at the bookstore with him, listening to his lengthy policy explanations, and watching all those news conferences. Mr. Clinton made me feel I mattered. With the Bush group, I feel I'm on the outside looking in. And if I try to find out what they're talking about, I'm going to get in trouble.
