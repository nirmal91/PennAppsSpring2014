Winter is officially only two weeks under way, but people are already feeling its drying effects. Whether spooked by the toll taken by last year's long and deep freeze, or parched by an excess of holiday cocktails and central heating, shoppers are soaking up moisturizing creams, lotions and skin treatments designed to battle the elements. Here are some of the best new industrial-strength balms and treatments.
For all-over conditioning, a coconut milk wrap at the Greenhouse Spa is a comforting way to come in from the cold. The skin is exfoliated with a body polish of coconut, mung bean and spices, bathed in warm coconut milk and then cocooned in foil to lock in the moisture ($135; 212-644-4449).
