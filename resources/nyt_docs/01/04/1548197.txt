To the Editor:
The focus on parents as the root source of bullying behavior and social exclusion represents only a small part of the problem (''For Parents, Courses on Remedial Bullying,'' Jersey column, Dec. 28). Bullying behavior could not be sustained in schools if teachers, school counselors and administrators set a tone and climate that such behavior is unacceptable. Chronic bullies represent at most 10 to 15 percent of the student population at a school. If the remaining students learned not to collude with the bullies, the motivational base of bullying would be diminished, as would this hurtful form of behavior. Student want to feel safe psychologically; they simply need guidance in learning how to create such an atmosphere.
