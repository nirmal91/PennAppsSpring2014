To the Editor:
For the last several years at the Riverdale Senior Services in Riverdale, the Bronx, we have been knitting together every week. In late fall and winter, hats and scarves for the homeless are delivered on Saturday nights at the end of the IRT subway line, along with sandwiches and coffee. The rest of the year, we knit baby and children's clothes for the women's prison at Bedford Hills, N.Y.
