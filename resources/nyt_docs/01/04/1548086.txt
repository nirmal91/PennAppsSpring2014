I was surprised at the selection of people whose lives mattered to Long Island [''In Lieu of Flowers: Remembering 17 Who Made a Difference,'' Dec. 28]. If anyone from the Health Sciences Center at SUNY Stony Brook left a lasting legacy to the people of Long Island it was Marvin Kuschner, who died on Oct. 17.
A resident of Huntington and Montauk and a physician, he joined the faculty at Stony Brook and, as dean, organized a brand new medical school in the State University of New York. During his tenure as dean he oversaw the education of some 2,000 medical students and an equal number of postgraduate resident physicians. Many from both groups are now in practice on Long Island.
Dr. Kuschner's contribution to Long Islanders will last long beyond his death.

Correction:  January 11, 2004, Sunday  A letter to the editor last Sunday about a Dec. 28 article profiling notable Long Islanders who died in 2003 referred erroneously to Dr. Marvin Kuschner, the first dean of the Stony Brook University medical school. His death occurred in 2002 (on Oct. 18), not in 2003, and he was included in the 2002 year-end profiles.
