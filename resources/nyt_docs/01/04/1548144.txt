To the Editor:
Re ''The Unkept Promise'' (editorial, ''Harvesting Poverty'' series, Dec. 30): You visited ''some of the poorest nations in the world in the last six months'' to arrive at the conclusion that farm subsidies ''contribute mightily'' to poverty in poor countries. Too bad you didn't visit farmers in your own backyard -- upstate New York.
Data from the International Monetary Fund show record cash flow into many of the poorer countries to buy products -- tomatoes from Mexico, apple juice concentrate from China, for example -- that flow back here to compete unfairly with American farmers who produce under the weight of environmental, social and workplace regulations and minimum wage and tax loads that foreign producers do not have.
Why should we sacrifice our food security and shaky rural economies just because these poorer countries cannot get the cash into the hands of their peasant farmers and workers?
