When I first saw Marshall Sella's article on Dennis Kucinich, I was over the moon (Dec. 21). My elation faded, however, as I read it. Kucinich is short (a couple inches shorter than Lieberman), he's uncharismatic, he's a vegan, and he's on the left end of the spectrum.
I'd rather hear about his unwavering stance against the Iraq war, his plan for true universal health care, his commitment to guaranteed pre-K-through-college education, his stance on minority and gay rights and his willingness to face down corporate power.
What makes a candidate electable? Is it stature and good looks? Is it money? The answer is that the biggest deciding factor of electability is coverage in the news media.
Is Kucinich too optimistic? Maybe so, but if he is, it's because he, like me, was raised to believe that America is a country where even a dirt-poor kid can make a difference without money, without influence and without media backing.
