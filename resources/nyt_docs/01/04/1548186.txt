Wet and wild. That pretty much sums up 2003.
New Jersey had its fourth-wettest year on record in 2003, but since the rain and snow was generally spread out, the state escaped most ill effects, according to the state's climatologist, David A. Robinson.
Mr. Robinson said the average of 36 weather stations around the state arrived at the figure of 57.8 inches of precipitation for the year -- significantly above the 47.2 inches the state has averaged since records started being kept in 1895. The wettest year on record was 1996, he said, when 60 inches of precipitation pounded the state.
He noted that that since there were no major rainfalls -- the kind that can cause severe flooding -- the overabundance of precipitation was, actually, a good thing, especially coming in the aftermath of drought conditions that lasted off-and-on from 1998 until October 2002.
Despite that drought, Mr. Robinson said, the wettest six years have all been since 1972.
Why? Climatologists have come to no conclusions.
