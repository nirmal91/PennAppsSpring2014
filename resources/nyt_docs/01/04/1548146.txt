To the Editor:
Re ''What We Will Do in 2004,'' by Colin L. Powell (Op-Ed, Jan. 1):
Secretary of State Powell's assertion that Americans are safer now than we were a year ago is mind-boggling. Were American soldiers then being killed and maimed daily in Iraq, with no end in sight?
Secretary Powell says that Iraq is no longer ''an incubator for weapons of mass murder that could fall into terrorists' hands.'' If there is any evidence that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction, the State Department has yet to reveal it.
If the secretary's foreign policy agenda for 2004 is as misleading as his portrayal of the security situation we faced 12 months ago, it will have scant chance of success.
