To the Editor:
Re Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's New Year's resolutions for the Bush administration (Op-Ed, Jan. 1): Bringing freedom to the world at the point of a gun (or missile or cluster bomb) ignores the fact that the United States is killing people to free them.
Not a few of our own citizens are dying in the effort, which is not as welcome as we think it should be because people in other countries don't want our vision of freedom imposed upon them by the barrel of an M-16.
