Students packed the streets of the city over the holidays. Their clothes often reflect tribal styles or uncorralled experimenting, mixing the past and the future, as did the flower children (left) with their pink daisies, and the Japanese kids (top, far right) in their unmatched sneakers. The Fifth Avenue promenade included many a stop at a popular photo op (below), and at least one proposal on bended knee under the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, above.
