Over the last 50 years, the Pennsauken Mart has been a latter-day Lower East Side for South Jerseyans. Never glamorous and often derided, the Mart was a proto-mall, with cement floors and stands just a step up from push-carts, selling mostly cut-rate merchandise and high-carb food.
Before Cherry Hill and Paramus and Short Hills made the enclosed, air-conditioned shopping experience upscale, the Mart -- enclosed but hardly air-conditioned -- served the hoi polloi with discount furniture, body-piercing, slabs of pizza and knick-knacks galore.
But an agreement last week between the Mart's merchants and Camden County officials has effectively sealed the fate of the 150-store complex. The merchants dropped their federal lawsuit against the county, which will now go ahead with its plans to demolish the Mart and replace it with a civic center/sports arena.
Most of the merchants are now set to go to a projected revamping of the old Village Mall in Willingboro, about 10 miles north of the Mart on Route 130. They are still negotiating with the county, which has tentatively promised them reduced rents through the fall, when the Village Mall project is expected to open.
The merchants were surprised earlier this year when the county announced its plans without consulting them. The arena will seat 6,500 and be home to a minor-league hockey team.
