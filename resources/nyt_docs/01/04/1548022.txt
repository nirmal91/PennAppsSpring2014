To the Editor:
Re ''When All the Numbers Are In, Do Hedge Funds Shine?'' (Strategies, Nov. 30), about findings of an unpublished working paper about hedge fund performance:
The paper's authors offered three scenarios in describing a belief that reported hedge fund performance was skewed, but the column was based on just one of them.
Although the researchers have done some interesting research, they have made some assumptions that do not reflect reality. More important, the assumptions used to determine a fund's price when a fund stops reporting to a database are contrary to documented investor experience.
One simple and effective measure of hedge fund performance is to look at returns of funds of hedge funds. Most funds of hedge funds require a reasonably seasoned track record and portfolio of assets before they invest in a hedge fund. The TASS Fund of Fund Universe Average had an annualized net return of 8.25 percent from 1996 through 2002, forming a good representation of what actual dollars have earned in hedge funds over the period.
