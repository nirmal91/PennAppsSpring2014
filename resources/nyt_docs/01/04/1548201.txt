The Westchester County Department of Health is awarding four grants totaling more than $55,000 to enhance preparedness in the event of a bioterrorism attack. The money, which came from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is part of a larger grant awarded to the county to improve the county's ability to respond to such an attack.
Northern Metropolitan Hospital Association will get $10,250 to improve emergency communications between acute care hospitals in the county. The Mental Health Association of Westchester will receive $15,000 to help prepare senior citizens and then care givers, particularly those who are Spanish speaking, for a large-scale emergency.
St. John's Riverside Hospital will get $15,000 to develop mobile decontamination capability, and Westchester-Rockland Veterinary Medical Association is receiving $15,000 to train veterinarians and assistants to respond to such disasters as well as develop a system for housing and decontaminating domestic animals in the event of an attack.
County Executive Andrew J. Spano said the grants are another step toward developing a comprehensive response plan to deal with public health emergencies, a process that's been accelerated since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
