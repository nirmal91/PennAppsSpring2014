To The Editor:
Regarding ''Legacies of Notable Lives'' (Dec. 28): In your stirring tribute, you omitted Lee S. Kreindler of Chappaqua, who died early in 2003 at age 78. Mr. Kreindler, my uncle, literally wrote the book on aviation accident law and was an internationally honored advocate for those stricken by tragic loss. To quote from the Feb. 19 obituary in The New York Times, he was ''considered the founder of air disaster law.''
''In 1989, The National Law Journal asked lawyers in the aviation field whom they would hire if a family member died in a plane crash,'' the obituary said. ''About 20 lawyers and firms were mentioned in all, but the newspaper noted that Mr. Kreindler, 'the grandfather of the field,' was at the top of nearly everyone's list.''
Mr. Kreindler's death came as an unprecedented multi-billion-dollar agreement was being finalized with the Libyan government in the case of the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie disaster, to which he had devoted incredible energy and innovation over 15 years. This case was a fitting last example of a legacy of compassion, commitment, and unparalleled legal and technical genius.
Your worthy effort at recognizing several Westchester individuals whose lives had a great impact would have been more significant if this pioneer had been included.
