To the Editor:
Re ''The Unkept Promise'' (editorial, ''Harvesting Poverty'' series, Dec. 30):
You do not need to travel abroad to witness the costs of American farm policy on third world lives. These lives are inside our borders.
The hand that picks the produce we buy at the supermarket may well be that of a poorly educated illegal immigrant with few or no worker safety protections. Many states do not require farms to provide workers' compensation insurance.
