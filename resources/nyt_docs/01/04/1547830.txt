PAIN KILLER
A ''Wonder'' Drug's Trail
of Addiction and Death.
By Barry Meier.
Rodale, $24.95.
In 1996 a drug company, Purdue, put OxyContin, a slow-acting opiate, on the market. It helped many people with chronic pain -- allowing sufferers to sleep through the night without interruption -- but soon several cases of addiction and fatal OxyContin-related overdoses erupted across the country. In ''Pain Killer,'' Barry Meier traces the causes of this episode, in particular exploring the role of Purdue's aggressive marketing to physicians. For years, doctors who prescribed OxyContin were told that the risk of addiction to the painkiller was less than 1 percent. Only after the drug had devastated thousands of lives was it revealed that this figure, touted as scientific fact, was based on a small study that had no relevance for the general public. Meier, a reporter at The New York Times, describes activist groups that received financial support from Purdue and lobbied for more liberal use of pain relievers. He also tracks the lives of individuals whose paths converged in this pharmaceutical disaster. Meier marshals an enormous quantity of data -- more than 200 interviews and thousands of pages of documents -- to tell this story of medicine ''flying blind.''
