MR. APOLOGY
And Other Essays.
By Alec Wilkinson.
Houghton Mifflin, $24.
In May 1994, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy was executed at the Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois. Alec Wilkinson's profile of Gacy remains as chilling as when it was published in The New Yorker in 1994. Like the other pieces collected in ''Mr. Apology,'' ''Conversations With a Killer'' displays Wilkinson's ability to elicit uncannily candid remarks from his subjects (at one point, Gacy said: ''Why would I want to kill these boys, anyway? I'm not their father'') and his use of short, declarative statements that are deceptively descriptive (''He appears to have no inner being''). Besides sketches of celebrities like Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, the singer and songwriter Paul Simon and the hockey goaltender Mike Richter, Wilkinson also examines offbeat topics like Mr. Apology, a man who runs a telephone service on which people can call and confess their sins and crimes to an answering machine.
