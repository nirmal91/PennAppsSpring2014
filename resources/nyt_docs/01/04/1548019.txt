Many consultants take time off during the holidays, but Jim Jenkins can't afford to.
Last week, Mr. Jenkins, the president of Creative Visions Consulting, an executive coaching firm based in Frederick, Md., said he was ''swamped'' with calls from executives looking for help in carrying out their New Year's resolutions.
In recent years, Mr. Jenkins said, more and more high-powered businesspeople have resolved to spend more time with their families.
''It's a recurring theme,'' he said. ''They hang out with their family over Christmas or Hanukkah, and they realize, 'I should be spending more time with these people.'''
But for resolutions for 2004, Mr. Jenkins says he has been getting more calls from overworked executives who want to ''reignite the flame'' with their spouses.
''As many people have tried to achieve balance between work and children, they've forgotten about their relationships with their wives or husbands,'' he said.
Mr. Jenkins recently coached one such executive, a vice president for communications at a major corporation, who said that his wife complained that he treated her like an employee. Mr. Jenkins suggested that the executive designate one night each week as ''date night,'' and take his wife to a fancy dinner. By doing this, Mr. Jenkins suggested, the couple might relearn how to interact as husband and wife.
Is it working? Sort of. ''I'm not sure that their romantic life has improved that much,'' Mr. Jenkins said.
But, he added, the executive's wife says he has become ''a lot less bossy.''
