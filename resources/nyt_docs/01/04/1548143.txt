To the Editor:
Re ''The Unkept Promise'' (editorial, ''Harvesting Poverty'' series, Dec. 30):
Your series has explored the damage that the unconscionable agricultural subsidies of the United States and other Western countries do to the developing world.
These same policies also do significant damage to the American environment, not only by encouraging overproduction of monocultural row crops, but also by, in effect, subsidizing the excessive and inefficient use of natural gas-based fertilizers and by artificially raising the cost of agricultural land, thereby harming local and sustainable food systems that might otherwise emerge.
