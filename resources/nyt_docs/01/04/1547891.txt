The Zermatt ski resort in Switzerland inaugurated Europe's longest glacier chair lift this season. The 8,465-foot-long lift can transport 2,400 people up the Theodul glacier every hour, ascending from Trockener Steg, at 9,642 feet, to Furggsattel station, at 11,040 feet, in eight and a half minutes. It provides rapid ski access 365 days a year.
The Furggsattel lift, as it is called, straddles the Italian border and took more than 18 months to build. Since 12 of its 18 supporting masts stand on glacier ice, the system has been engineered so that technicians can shift and revolve the masts to accommodate the glacier's movement. The new lift, with 119 six-person chairs, replaces T-bar lifts.
