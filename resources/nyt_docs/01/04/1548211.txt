Seattle Seahawks (10-6) at Green Bay Packers (10-6)  1 p.m., Fox
When these teams played Oct. 5, Green Bay crushed Seattle with a 35-13 clinic in offensive efficiency. Brett Favre was virtually flawless, completing passes to eight receivers while going 19 of 25 for 185 yards and 2 touchdowns in what was, by Favrian standards, a conservative game. The Packers scored touchdowns on five consecutive drives.
Matt Hasselbeck, who was Favre's backup in Green Bay under Mike Holmgren before following Holmgren to Seattle, said, Maybe the game would have been closer, but it's tough to win when Brett Favre is having a Brett Favre day.
The Packers needed a miraculous play in Arizona just to make the playoffs, but now they are riding the emotional crest of Favre's spine-tingling performance against the Raiders two weeks ago, 24 hours after his father died. But Favre was operating at a high level even before that. He was named the National Football Conference's offensive player of the month for December, when the Packers went 4-0 and he completed 79 of 117 passes for 1,003 yards, 10 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.
Hasselbeck has resided in Favre's shadow since being his backup, but he had a breakthrough season, finally getting to start 16 games. The statistics he piled up in the first 38 starts of his career are comparable to Favre's. But in the first meeting between these teams, Hasselbeck was 23 of 39 for 225 yards, no touchdowns and an interception.
Neither of these teams has a great pass defense, so the quarterbacks will probably determine the outcome.
