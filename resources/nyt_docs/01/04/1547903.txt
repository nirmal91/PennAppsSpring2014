Unlicensed contractors, beware: inspectors from the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs are on the lookout for you.
''This past year, the D.C.A. issued nearly 300 violations and seized a total of 50 vehicles belonging to contractors operating without a license,'' said Dina Improta, a department spokeswoman.
Ms. Improta said that by law a contractor who performs remodeling or repair work on residential property must obtain a license. To do so, a person must pass a criminal background check and a written examination. The contractor must also have workers' compensation insurance and post a bond or pay into a department fund to provide restitution to consumers.
''We have inspectors out in the field every day and in every borough,'' Ms. Improta said. ''And if they see a truck that doesn't have a license number on it, they will ask the contractor to produce his license.''
Licensed contractors, she said, must use contracts in ''plain English'' that provide a complete description of the work to be done, the cost of materials, the approximate start and end dates, and a detailed payment schedule. Contractors who violate the law can be ordered to make restitution, pay a fine or both. Those whose cars are seized must obtain a license, pay a $1,000 fine, pay into the trust fund and resolve any outstanding complaints before the vehicle is returned.
Consumers can find out if a contractor is licensed by calling 311 or by visiting www.nyc.gov/consumers.
