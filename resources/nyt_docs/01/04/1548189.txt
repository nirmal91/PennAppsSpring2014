Just before his term as Suffolk county executive ended last week, Robert J. Gaffney announced that an agreement had been reached to purchase and preserve a Setauket working farm that dates to the 17th century.
The 32-acre parcel, which is owned by the Detmer family, runs from North Country Road to Route 25A. For more than a decade, the county sought to protect the land, but could not reach agreement with the Detmer family on the price, said Tim Ryan, a Gaffney spokesman.
That changed with Tuesday's announcement. Mr. Gaffney announced that the Peconic Land Trust, a nonprofit preservation organization, would purchase the land for $6.2 million, with the county buying the development rights for $5.8 million to prevent future development. The Detmer family will continue to operate the farm, which produces cabbage and corn.
The farm dates to 1672, when John Thompson, the family patriarch, settled in Setauket. His son, Samuel, Revolutionary War patriot, built the Thompson House, the original farmhouse for the property, which is still standing. However, in the last couple of years, development threatened the preservation efforts, Mr. Gaffney said. In January 2000 the town board rejected the Detmers' application to build a 380-unit senior housing complex on the land. In 2001, the County Legislature approved the acquisition under the county's farmland preservation program.
