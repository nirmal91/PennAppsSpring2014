When Deena Mader wrote a letter to the city of Stamford seeking compensation for lost modeling wages for her 2-year-old son, who cut his head at a city playground, she didn't expect the claim would make headlines worldwide.
People throughout the country have written to city officials, most of them upset at what they viewed as a mother trying to profit off of her son's injury.
Ms. Mader, however, stressed that she wasn't interested in making money. When reached by phone last week, she refused to comment about her claim. She instead referred to a statement she sent to The Stamford Advocate and The Greenwich Time, where she wrote that her ''heart was in the right place as a parent who saw safety improvement opportunities at a playground near our home.''
On Nov. 4, Konrad Mader ran into a pole holding up a guardrail at Twin Meadows playground. He needed stitches to close the wound.
In a letter to the city, Ms. Mader wrote that she was concerned about safety at the playground. But the paragraph that received the most attention was the one where Ms. Mader wrote that she was seeking a ''lost wage amount due to his inability to audition or take modeling or commercial jobs while his head heals.''
Ms. Mader wrote that she regretted asking for money.
''Regretfully, I thought the final paragraph of my letter that referred to compensation would get the attention of someone at the city level to act,'' Ms. Mader wrote. ''It was never my intent to pursue a claim against anyone.''
Thomas M. Cassone, director of legal affairs and corporation counsel for Stamford, said he thought some of the letters were ''unduly harsh'' and felt sorry for Ms. Mader.
''I kind of felt badly for the claimant,'' he said, pausing for a moment. ''Not badly enough for me to settle the claim.''
