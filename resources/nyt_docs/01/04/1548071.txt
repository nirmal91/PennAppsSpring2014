A fire that the authorities believe was intentionally set next to a Queens grocery yesterday morning killed a man in his apartment two stories above and sent neighbors jumping from windows, fire officials said.
Officials said they found traces of an accelerant at the site of the fire, which began shortly after 2 a.m. beside Al-Amin Grocery and Halal Meat, at 111-09 Liberty Avenue in Ozone Park. Ashram Katwarol, 49, died in the top apartment of the three-story building, and his son, Adrian, 19, was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in critical condition. Later, he was transferred to the burn unit at Weill Cornell Center.
Mr. Katwarol's daughter arrived at the home shortly after the fire began, a neighbor said.
On the second floor, Ernesto Valdes, 47, heard glass shatter and an explosion below, and one of his three teenage children ran into his room shouting, ''Fire!'' he said.
''When I tried to open the door, the fire came from the stairs,'' he said later yesterday.
All three children leapt out a rear window to the backyard, and Mr. Valdes and his girlfriend jumped from a kitchen window to the ledge of another building, Mr. Valdes said. The children suffered scratches from the broken glass but were otherwise unhurt, he said. His apartment and Mr. Katwarol's were the only two apartments in the building.
The front of the store stocked compact discs, while the rear was a grocery. The fire appeared to have started in the doorway of the building, which is next to the store. Smoke and flames heavily damaged the building, in a neighborhood of working-class Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants. ''I lost everything,'' Mr. Valdes said.
Mr. Katwarol was an automobile mechanic, his neighbor said.
Down Liberty Avenue from the site of the fire, at Bonita Unisex Salon, the owner recalled giving Adrian his regular haircuts and said he came from a hardworking family.
''It's sad, very sad,'' the woman said.
