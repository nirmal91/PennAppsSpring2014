To the Editor:
A Jan. 1 letter writer laments that she and other workers in the service industry have noticed that tourists in New York City have become increasingly tightfisted in giving tips.
While I cannot say what the problem is with ''upscale American out-of-towners,'' many Europeans are accustomed to dealing with service-sector employees who are paid a living wage by their employers and do not expect to be saved from poverty by the substantial gratuities prevalent in the United States.
The menu of an American restaurant I once visited openly addressed the issue by explaining the American tipping culture in detail in several languages.
Although practice varies somewhat in different parts of Europe, at least here in Finland, taxi drivers expect to be paid only what the meter shows, and waiters are quite happy with just a euro or two extra.
