An article in the Neighborhood Report pages last Sunday about Glenn Nordlinger, whose mail was not forwarded after he moved, misstated the intersection for his neighborhood post office, at 55th Street. It is at Third Avenue, not Sutton Place (which in any case, below 57th Street, is called Sutton Place South).
