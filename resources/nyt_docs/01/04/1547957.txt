To the Editor:
We can better feel the anguish and pain of our wounded soldiers when we read about one soldier, in this case, Sgt. Jeremy Feldbusch (''A Soldier's Return, to a Dark and Moody World,'' front page, Dec. 30). Anecdote always helps us understand statistics.
But we should not forget the (literally) untold sufferings of the Iraqi people, who are also casualties of our war. Adding the stories of the Iraqis whose lives have been shattered to those of American soldiers and their families and communities might help us better understand the total price of this conflict.
Looking beyond our national borders to the pain of others does not dilute our patriotism. It might help us balance, on a more appropriate scale, the pros and cons of starting war. Restricting our perception of pain just to Americans does not serve our souls or our country well.
