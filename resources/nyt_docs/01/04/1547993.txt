Long Island's most innovative chardonnay last year was Macari's 2003 Early Wine, from the North Fork. Made by a consultant, Helmut Gangl, it copies his native Austria's Jungwein (Young Wine), which is intended for immediate drinking. Food-friendly, this oak-free, zingy, dry white is pure fruit (lime, lemon and apple notes), tangy and refreshing. McAdam Buy-Rite, 398 Second Avenue (28th Street), charges $10.
