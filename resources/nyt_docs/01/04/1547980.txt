For 2004, Seek a Vietnamese Path
Tet, the Vietnamese new year, is a month away, but because Vietnamese food is both delicious and low in fat, it's an ideal way to start the year on a healthy yet satisfying note.
ANH [Rating: no stars]
(212) 532-2858; 363 Third Avenue (near 27th Street); $; $25 and Under: 7/2/03.
The kitchen at Anh renders Vietnamese dishes expertly, capturing the low-key delicacy with the right light touch. Thin slices of grilled Asian eggplant in a lime and ginger sauce are cooked with precision and green papaya salad is well balanced.
BOI [Rating: no stars]
(212) 681-6541; 246 East 44th Street (near Second Avenue); $$; Diner's Journal: 12/12/03.
This restaurant never lets the taste buds get restless. Menu highlights include spicy bean-thread noodles with crab meat, straw mushrooms and herbs; and thin and crispy Saigon crepes, folded over shrimp, meatballs, bean sprouts, lettuce and herbs in a chili-lime sauce.
HUE * [Rating: one star]
(212) 691-4170; 91 Charles Street (Bleecker Street); $$; Review: 10/1/03.
Although the menu may not be the main focus here, Hue, unlike many feverishly social restaurants, does care about the food. One of the best dishes is cari ga xao lin, large pieces of chicken simmered in a clay pot with sweet coconut milk, long beans and eggplant.
NAM [Rating: no stars]
(212) 267-1777; 110 Reade Street (near West Broadway); $; $25 and Under: 11/7/01.
The high ceiling, stylishly draped chairs, candles and cleverly backlighted old pictures of Vietnam make Nam feel almost Parisian. Nam's Vietnamese dishes are quietly linked to centuries of culinary tradition, yet unpretentious and delicately delicious.
NHA TRANG CENTRE [Rating: no stars]
(212) 941-9292; 148 Centre Street (near Walker Street), $; $25 and Under: 8/2/00.
When the original Nha Trang, at 87 Baxter Street, became increasingly popular and crowded at lunch, the owners opened this second location a block west. Familiar dishes are flawless here, like chao tom, grilled shrimp paste wrapped around a short stalk of sugar cane.
O MAI [Rating: no stars]
(212) 633-0550; 158 Ninth Avenue (near 20th Street); $; $25 and Under: 10/23/02.
O Mai is a stylized place that serves delicate Vietnamese fare, little of it blunted for the Western palate. Among the best dishes are appetizers like crispy spring rolls and papaya salad. Entrees include a roasted duck with lime-ginger dipping sauce, and saut√©ed chicken with chili-lemon grass sauce.
PHO GRAND [Rating: no stars]
(212) 965-5366; 277C Grand Street (near Forsyth Street); $; $25 and Under: 8/7/02.
The first thing to order here is the avocado juice. It is a phenomenal treat, thick and creamy but not heavy, and only a bit sweet. The menu includes fabulous combinations like grilled beef sesame, plumb little rolls of beef served on a flat rice noodle cake; and chicken curry with ginger and a creamy broth.
