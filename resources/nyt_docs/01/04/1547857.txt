Given the ease with which identity thieves find and exploit records from universities, hospitals and the like, it seems clear that one way to prevent such fraud is to limit the use of Social Security numbers (Stephen Mihm, Dec. 21). There is no excuse for doctors or educators using Social Security numbers to identify patients or students. Rather, they should use unique identification numbers generated specifically for their purposes.
