The Rev. Al Sharpton said that his presidential campaign had raised enough money in enough states to qualify for federal matching funds, which if verified by the Federal Election Commission would funnel more than $100,000 into his campaign with more tax dollars to follow.
It has been a struggle for Mr. Sharpton, operating with a bare-bones organization, to meet the threshold of raising $5,000 in donations -- each one under $250 -- in 20 states.
By the end of September, Mr. Sharpton had raised about $284,000, of which about 80 percent was in large donations, according to an analysis conducted by the Campaign Finance Institute, based in Washington. That made it difficult for Mr. Sharpton to qualify for matching funds, which require a candidate to collect a certain amount of small donations.
