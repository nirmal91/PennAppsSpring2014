An article on Dec. 14 about the Smoking Gun, a Web site that posts various documents relating to public figures, referred imprecisely to the action taken by Fox television in 2000 after the site uncovered records showing that Rick Rockwell of ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' had been legally barred from seeing a former girlfriend. Fox canceled a rebroadcast of the show, a popular one-episode special; it did not cancel the show itself.
