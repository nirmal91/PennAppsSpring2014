To the Editor:
Re ''It's the Thought That Counts'' (Dec. 21), Danny Gregory's images of the shopping opportunities on Canal Street: I'm glad you tipped your hat -- sideways -- to the marketplace in New York that most closely resembles the souk.
There, ground-floor spaces are subdivided into mini-stalls selling pocketbooks and Chinese net slippers; windows are rented out as perfumeries; and on weekends vendors compete on the prime west side corners of Broadway and Canal Street.
Africans selling watches displayed in briefcases are crammed cheek to jowl with Asians selling CD's from oversized trays balanced on shopping carts. Busloads of consumer adventurers from the hinterlands debark in front of the Canal Street post office to shop this bazaar. On weekends, sidewalks overflow into the street and are so crowded that even the three-card monte players have to relocate.
