To the Editor:
Paul Berman is correct to write that Edmund Wilson, a principled atheist, would not have much liked Alfred Kazin's ''God and the American Writer'' (Dec. 14).
He is wrong, however, to say that Kazin, ''ever faithful to Wilson,'' would deny any intent to rebuke Wilson. Kazin, who greatly admired Wilson and who did once write that he believed he would find even Wilson's laundry list interesting, repeatedly rebuked Wilson in public (and in private) for arguing against the United States' entry into World War II and for his apolitical, ahistorical view that all wars, including especially Lincoln's efforts in the Civil War, can be reduced to an animalistic ''power-drive.''
''To say that war is simply and exclusively a power struggle is to ignore the conscious differences of outlook that are always behind such struggles,'' Kazin wrote to Wilson, defending his attack in The Reporter on Wilson's ''surly and sarcastic'' ''Preface'' to ''Patriotic Gore.'' ''The danger of this point of view . . . is that it makes Hitler out to be no worse than Churchill.''
Alfred Kazin's relationship with Edmund Wilson constitutes a fascinating chapter in our culture's history, coinciding with the postwar rise to prominence of Jewish-American writers in a national culture formerly dominated largely by WASP's. It is important to understand that the relationship between pre-eminent figures from both groups was not a one-sided one.
