To the Editor:
The making of a surgeon involves developing skills of clear thinking and calm confidence amid unimaginable crises. Unfortunately, these skills have apparently eluded certain surgical specialty societies when it comes to reforming compensation of victims of surgical errors. Intimidating fair-minded qualified surgical experts from rendering testimony in support of patients is not only unjust but will harm the ability of surgeons to earn the trust of the public as well as future patients.
Nonetheless, a fair public policy on medical injuries is starting to emerge. The building blocks include modified no-fault compensation for victims, a medical review panel of qualified health care professionals and citizens, and guidelines for compensation.
