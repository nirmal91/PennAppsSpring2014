Golfers using Westchester County courses need to make the most of this weekend. The courses close for the rest of the month and February at the end of play Jan. 4. The courses are closed not because of inclement weather, but as a result of the increased potential for turf damage during harsh weather. The courses will reopen in late March, weather permitting, according to county officials. The five courses to be closed are Dunwoodie and Sprain Lake in Yonkers, Maple Moor in White Plains, Mohansic in Yorktown Heights and Saxon Woods in Scarsdale.
