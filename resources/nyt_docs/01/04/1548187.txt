In a move that ensures that aviation remains a part of the future operation at the former Grumman aircraft plant in Calverton, the Riverhead Town Board last week approved a seven-year contract extension for a skydiving company operating at the site, which is now owned by the town.
Skydive Long Island's contract with the town for use of the runway was to expire in 2006. The extension has granted the company, which uses the runway about 20 times a day on busy weekends, seven additional years until 2013.
Robert Kozakiewicz, the lame-duck town supervisor and a leading advocate of a continued aviation role at the site, said he voted for the contract extension because the skydiving business had satisfied the town in the past and he was sure it would do so in the future.
Many residents near the site want to close it to aviation. Regulations governing use of the runway that Skydive Long Island uses have not been completed.
Richard Amper, longtime opponent of aviation at the airport, called the contract extension a ''bad move on the part of a discredited administration,'' and added, ''Binding the town to a low-income-producing, bottom-end aviation use doesn't make sense.''
Mr. Amper said he hoped the new supervisor, Philip Cardinale, would find some way to rescind the contract extension.
Ray Maynard, owner of Skydive Long Island, said the contract extension is part of the long-term commitment he is looking for before he moves ahead with plans to purchase a 23,000-square-foot building on the site.
