Winter is officially only two weeks under way, but people are already feeling its drying effects. Whether spooked by the toll taken by last year's long and deep freeze, or parched by an excess of holiday cocktails and central heating, shoppers are soaking up moisturizing creams, lotions and skin treatments designed to battle the elements. Here are some of the best new industrial-strength balms and treatments.
To tame dry, static-filled hair, an Extreme Protein Conditioning Treatment at Frédéric Fekkai could be just the tonic. During the one-hour treatment ($150 at the Frédéric Fekkai Salon in New York, 212-753-9500), a protein mask is massaged into the hair, warmed under a heat lamp and then thermally sealed with a flatiron.
