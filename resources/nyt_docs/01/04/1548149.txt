To the Editor:
Secretary of State Colin K. Powell (Op-Ed, Jan. 1) glosses over a major source of unrest in the Middle East and the world -- the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
While Israel continues to build settlements in occupied territories, the Bush administration hardly seems to care. Why not use ''America's formidable power'' to bring some semblance of peace to this area?
Our government might start by withholding part of our annual aid to Israel if settlements are not removed. Perhaps by committing less American money, we can save more American lives in 2004.
