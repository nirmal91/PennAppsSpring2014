Not that Dvorak's music has been neglected by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra over the last decade. Far from it. During Zdenek Macal's tenure as music director, from 1993 to 2002, Dvorak was a staple, with results abundantly evident in a four-CD set of his works for chorus and orchestra to be issued this month by Delos International. The box adds a new release of the Te Deum and Psalm 149 (along with the concert overtures Opp. 91 to 93) to reissues of the Requiem, the Stabat Mater and other works.
Now Mr. Macal has returned to his homeland to conduct the Czech Philharmonic, and the New Jersey Symphony awaits its new maestro, Neeme Jarvi. But it continues its modest obsession, kicking off a Dvorak year, the centenary of the composer's death, with the festival Inspiring America. The concerts begin on Thursday at the State Theater in New Brunswick, then center on the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, where they end on Jan. 25. Anne Manson, Vassily Sinaisky and Stanislaw Skrowaczewski conduct programs including Dvorak's last three symphonies and the concertos for cello (with Jonathan Spitz as soloist), violin (Gil Shaham) and piano (Tzimon Barto).
The festival opens on Wednesday evening with ''A Dvorak Sampler,'' a program at the Newark Museum including a performance of Dvorak's ''American'' String Quartet and a discussion overseen by Joseph Horowitz, the festival consultant. The scholar Robert Winter will demonstrate his new DVD, ''From the New World.'' That disc and a recent book for young readers by Mr. Horowitz, ''Dvorak in America: In Search of the New World,'' will both be used in educational projects tied to the festival.
Other surrounding events also speak to a high level of ambition and a rich imagination not exactly reflected in the the conservative orchestral programs themselves. All they promise is good, dependable listening.
