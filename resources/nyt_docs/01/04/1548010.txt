To the Editor:
As was noted in your essay ''Hard Lives, Hard Choices'' (Dec. 21), about the calculations New Yorkers make when deciding which beggars to give money to, with so many people in desperate need, it's hard for caring individuals to decide whom to help and how. We face this dilemma every time we pass an outstretched hand.
We may give reluctantly, wondering how our money will be spent or questioning if, through our spare change, we're simply enabling people to live on the street.
For answers to this age-old quandary, turn to Maimonides, the 12th-century philosopher, who divided acts of charity into eight levels. He assigned the lowest score to giving begrudgingly, passing judgment on those who seek our help. The greatest charity, he said, is helping people become self-reliant.
When we see people hurting, we must reach out, generously and nonjudgmentally. But to attain the highest level of giving, it is equally important to translate charity into action, to help transform our society into one in which everyone has the ability to thrive and we no longer need to decide which person on the street is most deserving.
