The offices of GSD&amp;M, an advertising agency based in Austin, Tex., have conference rooms adorned with artificial turf and eight-foot-long cows hanging from the ceiling. So when Brian Wheelis, a vice president and group media director, suggested an idea for some new office d√©cor, employees knew that anything was possible.
Seven months ago, Mr. Wheelis, a fan of ''Trading Spaces,'' a cable television show on which neighbors redecorate rooms in each other's homes, decided to spice things up around the office by instituting a similar concept there. Once a month, all 220 employees in the company's media department are invited to put their names into a hat to commit their work space to another's eye -- or lack thereof -- for design.
Mr. Wheelis draws two names, and the winners redo each other's space on a $10 budget.
''One of the key challenges for my staff is to explore new ways to think about things,'' he said. ''This kind of activity definitely gets people thinking creatively.''
The results have been mixed. One worker received rave reviews from an officemate when he decorated her space with what Mr. Wheelis described as a ''Tom Petty Alice-in-Wonderland kind of feel,'' with one-foot-square mirrors and corkboard forming a checkerboard pattern on the wall.
Another employee, though, was dismayed to see her cubicle turned into a setting reminiscent of ''I Dream of Jeannie,'' featuring secondhand scarves in wild colors. ''For the person who was to work there, the design was a tad overwhelming,'' Mr. Wheelis said.
