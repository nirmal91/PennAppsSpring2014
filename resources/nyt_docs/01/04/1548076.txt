The United States Capitol was closed for more than four hours on Saturday after a ''potentially hazardous substance'' was detected in the basement on the Senate side, a spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said.
The building was evacuated while Capitol Police tried to determine whether the substance, an industrial solvent, was hazardous, said the spokeswoman, Jessica Gissubel.
Initial field tests on the substance were negative, and the building re-opened by late evening, she said. The substance will be taken to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for further analysis.
Ms. Gissubel said she could not give any details about the incident because ''we do not know what caused it.''
