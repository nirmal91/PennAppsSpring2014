FOR nearly 15 years, ever since he was banned from baseball for illegal betting, Pete Rose has categorically insisted -- sworn to high heaven -- that he absolutely, unequivocally did not gamble on baseball.
But apparently, he is now confessing in a new autobiography, ''My Prison Without Bars,'' written with Rick Hill, that he indeed bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds.
The publisher, Rodale Press, has embargoed the book until Thursday. The secrecy, and the huge 500,000 first printing, lends credence to the belief that Rose will confess to the sin that, in effect, has barred him from baseball since August 1989 and consequently from being elected to the Hall of Fame.
Bud Selig, baseball's commissioner, has made it clear that Rose must confess to gambling on the game and show contrition before he is reinstated. A major-league official told The New York Times last week that Rose has already admitted to Selig that he bet on baseball. One may still be skeptical of the motivation for writing the book.
Rose, who is not unwise in the ways of capitalism, has decided not to tell his tale publicly in, say, a news conference, but to reveal it in a book -- one that has the potential to land on the best-seller lists.
