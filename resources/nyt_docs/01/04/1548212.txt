Denver Broncos (10-6) at Indianapolis Colts (12-4)  4:30 p.m., CBS
Two weeks ago, when these two met, the Broncos were on their usual mission to show that it does not matter which running back lines up in their backfield. Filling in for the injured Clinton Portis, Quentin Griffin ran for 136 yards against the Colts in a 31-17 victory. Denver rushed for 227 yards over all, and the Broncos had a 45 minutes to 15 minutes edge in time of possession.
Portis is healthy again, but Griffin's numbers prove that the offensive line is the true force in that running game.
The Colts could help matters by mounting a running game themselves to sway that time-of-possession battle. Peyton Manning, so unstoppable early in the season, has not been so dominant in the second half as defenses have locked on to some of the Colts' tendencies. In a pinch, the Colts always turn to the passing game and to receiver Marvin Harrison. Against playoff teams, the Colts need a diversified attack. Edgerrin James rushed for 42 yards the last time these teams met.
Both teams, have demons to battle. Manning's numbers remain astounding -- 4,267 yards passing and 29 touchdowns this season -- but he has not led his team to a playoff victory in three tries. This was supposed to be the year that Coach Tony Dungy revived the defense. Denver has already punched a hole in that theory, but it does not take any heat off Manning.
The Broncos, meanwhile, are trying to spare Coach Mike Shanahan from the nagging criticism that he has not won a single playoff game since quarterback John Elway retired.
