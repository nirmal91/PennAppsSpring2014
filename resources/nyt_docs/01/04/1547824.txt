To the Editor
Oliver Taplin's review of Mary Lefkowitz's ''Greek Gods, Human Lives'' (Dec. 14) could make more of the essential distinction that so often in Greek literature lends human life its particular weight and dignity: unlike the gods, we humans die.
Zeus and Hera quarrel in the first book of the ''Iliad,'' Hephaestus catches the adulterous Ares and Aphrodite in an ''Odyssey'' interlude, but in neither case are the consequences serious: gods may lose face, may hurt for a while, but life goes on. In contrast, when Achilles and Agamemnon quarrel in the same first book of the ''Iliad,'' the result is the death of countless Greeks and Trojans, and eventually of Achilles himself; when Odysseus catches the suitors courting Penelope in the ''Odyssey,'' they pay with their lives.
Human actions have meaning because they involve life-and-death choices, something not open to the gods. To ignore the gods' role in Greek literature is above all to limit our understanding of the humans we encounter there, for it is the presence of the immortal gods that, in Lefkowitz's words, ''allows mortals to display their humanity.''
