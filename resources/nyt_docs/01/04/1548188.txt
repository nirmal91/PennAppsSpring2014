With Mayor Barbara K. Miller casting the tie-breaking vote, trustees of the Village of Garden City have advanced an estimated $27 million plan to relocate the village library at St. Paul's School, a 500-room former Episcopal school listed on the National Register of Historic Places but falling into serious disrepair.
The vote authorized the drafting of a bonding proposal that would need the approval of village residents at a future referendum for which no date was set. A $27 million bond would require an annual tax increase of $257 for an average village taxpayer.
The village purchased the 120-year-old Gothic school building from the financially troubled Garden City-based Episcopal Diocese of Long Island 10 years ago. Competing plans for what to do with the structure, including one to raze it, have been debated ever since.
Robert L. Schoelle Jr., the village administrator, said the Dec. 18 vote meant that the village government was ''moving forward on the public use of the historic main building'' as a library and community center. The library would occupy about half of the 100,000 square feet of interior space.
Preservationists said they were encouraged by the vote. ''It is a favorable development,'' said Robert B. McKay, the director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities in Cold Spring Harbor.
