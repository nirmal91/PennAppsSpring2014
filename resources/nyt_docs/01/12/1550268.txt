SKIING  Miller Ends Slalom Slump
Bode Miller showed some of his old power yesterday, finishing third in a World Cup slalom race in Chamonix, France, that was won by Giorgio Rocca of Italy. Pierrick Bourgeat of France was second.
Until yesterday, Miller had not scored in a slalom since last February, when he was sixth in South Korea. He had failed to finish many slaloms, struggling with equipment and execution. He won the season's opening combined race, with his times from Saturday's downhill added to those from yesterday's slalom. He was 34th in the downhill. Miller was the combined champion in 2003. (AP)
