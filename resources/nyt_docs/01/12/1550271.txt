Three moving-company employees were arrested yesterday and charged with killing their supervisor in a drunken brawl on Friday at their company's warehouse and dumping his body near a Bronx park, the authorities said. The body of the supervisor, whom the police identified yesterday as Pierre Bentley Reynolds Jr., 45, had stab wounds in its torso and was found shortly before 5 p.m. Friday at East 204th Street and Webster Avenue. The police said the three employees, charged with second-degree murder, were Johnny Hernandez, 18; Kile Anderson, 38; and James Alicea, 18. They had worked with Mr. Reynolds at the All American Moving &amp; Storage Company. Several messages left with All American were not returned yesterday.
