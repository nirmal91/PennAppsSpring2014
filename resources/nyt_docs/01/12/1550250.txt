To the Editor:
Re ''Young Doctors and Wish Lists: No Weekend Calls, No Beepers'' (front page, Jan. 7):
When I did my residency in internal medicine, my colleagues were as tough as they were smart. Providing superior care for difficult patients under trying conditions was a matter of pride and honor.
When this required 100 hours a week, the ability and willingness to do so were a given. The atmosphere was something like war, and the camaraderie among the staff was akin to that of troops in battle. Dermatologists were regarded with polite contempt.
Having since experienced 25 years of sleep deprivation and relatively modest earning power, I can sympathize with the students you describe. But this cultural shift means that something important has been lost -- particularly for the patients of the future.
