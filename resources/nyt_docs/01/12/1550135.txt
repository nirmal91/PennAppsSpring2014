To the Editor:
Re ''How to Be an Iowan for a Day'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 7):
Dan Savage writes, ''Maybe one or two reporters could ask Iowa's elections officials about why it's so easy to take part in the caucuses.''
As a former Iowan, I've participated in the caucus process on several occasions. The reason the caucus system works in Iowa is exactly the reason it wouldn't work in a larger state: the caucus attendees are neighbors.
Caucusgoers report to the designated assembly point for their party's voters by precinct. On a small scale, since a surprising -- and heartening -- number of Iowans actually know who lives in their neighborhood, it works quite well.
Caucus time always makes me homesick. Then I think about the dearth of jobs in the state, which is why I'm not there, and is perhaps the best reason for Iowans to show up on caucus night.
