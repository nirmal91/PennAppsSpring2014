To the Editor:
The assault at a Staten Island firehouse on New Year's Eve was a result of poor supervision and a lack of leadership.
As Tom Downey pointed out (''Hazing and Heroism,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 9), the crude culture of the firehouse has more to do with the necessary camaraderie that must be built into a firefighting team than it does with threatened or actual physical assaults.
The ridicule and the taunts that go on between calls are the necessary testing that cannot be carried out in probationary classes or in routine drills under the gaze of fire chiefs. It is the informal testing of individual men and women who must learn to work as a team, to trust and be trusted, and to know the nuances of each fellow firefighter and fire officer with whom they may carry out their next assignment.
I believe that the department will take the necessary measures to ensure that supervision and leadership are maintained. New Yorkers and the firefighters who serve them deserve nothing less.
