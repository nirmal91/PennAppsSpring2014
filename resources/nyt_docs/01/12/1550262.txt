Nearly 37 years after founding Rolling Stone, which grew from modest West Coast origins to become the bible of the American pop scene, Jann Wenner will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the organization is to announce today. Mr. Wenner is to be given a lifetime achievement award in the nonperformer category. He and the other inductees -- Jackson Browne, the Dells, George Harrison, Prince, Bob Seger, Traffic and ZZ Top -- are all to be honored at a ceremony on March 15 in New York. Some may find it a tad difficult to believe, but Mr. Wenner, who helped to found the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1983 and is an active board member, said the award surprised him. As if to quell any suspicion, he said on Friday that all voting was done by secret ballot. ''The voting committee is very rigorous,'' he said, ''and having been satisfied that's the case, I accept it with a lot of pleasure and humility.''
