Re ''Seeking Women's Votes, Clark Changes His Style'' (front page, Jan. 9):
According to a Clark campaign official, women don't know much about military personnel and need to be ''educated.'' Gen. Wesley K. Clark himself implies that they misperceive the military as ''male-dominated, hierarchical, authoritarian.''
Well, isn't it? The reason the Clark campaign is failing to win over women voters is that we don't like to be patronized.
