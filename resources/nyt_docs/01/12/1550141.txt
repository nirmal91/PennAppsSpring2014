To the Editor:
Re ''A Real State of New York'' (editorial, Jan. 8):
I am fascinated that calls for state government reform come from a broad range of concerned citizens, yet the politicians do not heed the calls or offer only platitudes designed to dissemble any real reform.
How can this be so? Is it citizen apathy? Or is it that there are no real choices offered by either political party, the emphasis being maintaining the status quo?
New York is not a democracy; it is not even a republic. It has degenerated into an oligarchy, and will not change until party-independent, determined people are selected by the citizens of the state to clean up thoroughly, starting with a new constitution severely limiting the ability of those associated with state government to act irresponsibly and against the common good.
