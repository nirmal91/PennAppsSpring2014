To the Editor:
Re ''Politics at the Border'' (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8):
We should look to the European experience for guidance.
Millions of guest workers who arrived after World War II chose to stay, creating a new form of second-class citizenship.
The children of these guest workers, who know no other culture, find themselves in limbo, alienated and resentful of the status accorded them and their parents.
The prospect of guest workers here in the United States is an affront to all of us, especially to legal immigrants, who have played by the rules.
We are a nation of laws, and those laws should simply be enforced. We cannot reward those who have broken the law.
