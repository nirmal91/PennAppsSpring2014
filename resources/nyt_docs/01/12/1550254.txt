America Online, owned by Time Warner, has narrowed to three finalists a review for the media part of its $300 million account, which has been handled for seven years by Initiative Media in Los Angeles and New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Ruth Sarfaty, a spokeswoman at AOL in Dulles, Va., identified the finalists as Initiative; Carat in New York, owned by the Aegis Group; and the Starcom MediaVest Group in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe. The agencies eliminated from the review, Ms. Sarfaty said, were Mediaedge:cia in New York, part of the WPP Group, and two agencies in New York owned by the Omnicom Group, OMD and PHD. A final decision in the review, being managed by Pile &amp; Company in Boston, is expected by mid-February.
