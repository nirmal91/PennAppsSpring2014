To the Editor:
A Jan. 7 front-page article said young doctors today are less likely to choose family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics because of the demanding hours. Another factor may be the escalating cost of medical liability insurance.
Just as more young doctors, particularly women, are becoming interested in working part time, the cost of insurance premiums is making part-time work unfeasible.
We are headed for a shortage of primary-care doctors. It is time to fix our system of assessing medical liability.
