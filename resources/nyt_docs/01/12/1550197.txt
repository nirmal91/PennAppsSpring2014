Mike Tyson's financial world, once filled with eight-figure bouts, has narrowed since he filed for bankruptcy protection last August.
Reports filed last month in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan show that Tyson's only substantial income between August and October came from a $175,000 advance from the K-1 Corporation, which promotes a type of fighting popular in Japan that mixes kick boxing, kung fu, karate and tae kwon do.
By comparison, the reports show, he earned $53.9 million from boxing between Jan. 1, 2001, and Aug. 1, 2003.
While Tyson has appeared in a promotional role for K-1, he has not signed a contract to fight. He has shown interest in challenging a popular K-1 fighter, Bob Sapp, a former professional football player who is nicknamed the Beast.
According to the bankruptcy documents, Tyson's one-year contract with K-1 calls for the company to pick up some of his living expenses. The papers show that his personal expenses were $30,000 last September and $25,000 in October.
Additional documents filed with the court show that in the year before he filed his bankruptcy petition last August, Tyson paid $2.1 million to his former wife Monica Turner and a combined $70,742 in child support to Nathalie Fears and Kimberly Scarborough, each of whom had a child with him. His expenses also included a $20,000 payment to the Farmington, Conn., tax collector for a house he purchased there, more than $6,000 for insurance and $8,750 to a mortgage company.
His company, Mike Tyson Enterprises, paid out $425,942 in the 90 days before the bankruptcy, including $302,500 to his former manager Shelly Finkel. Last Wednesday, Finkel described the sum as a reimbursement for expenses, not a commission from fight earnings.
Scarborough and Finkel are among Tyson's numerous creditors. Scarborough is owed $51,949, and Finkel, a member of Tyson's creditors' committee, is owed $4 million. Tyson's other large debtors include the Internal Revenue Service ($13.4 million) and the British tax authorities ($4 million).
The documents describe Tyson's generosity to Turner. His gifts of fur and jewelry to her and their children between 1996 and 2001 were appraised at $2.5 million. The gifts include a $4,200 Cartier Pasha watch, a $73,000 platinum-and-gold bracelet with 730 diamonds and a $101,260 platinum ring inscribed with the words ''heavyweight champion.''
Another $1.1 million in gifts were given to third parties since 1998, and Tyson ''does not recall the identities of such parties,'' according to the bankruptcy papers.
The purchases included $82,000 worth of men's mink and chinchilla fur coats and a women's mink jacket, whose whereabouts were listed as unknown.
