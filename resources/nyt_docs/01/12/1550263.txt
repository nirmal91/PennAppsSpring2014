As the Latino portion of the nation's population, now nearly 14 percent, continues to grow, so does the portion of the radio stations programmed primarily in Spanish.
By the end of 2003, the United States had 655 Spanish-language stations, or 6 percent of the nation's 10,870 commercial stations, according to M Street, a radio research company owned by Clear Channel Communications. The Spanish-language format is now the fifth most popular. A decade ago it was eighth, and there were only 361 Spanish stations.
''Radio is always changing to reflect the changing demographics and tastes of America,'' said Tom Taylor, editor in chief of Inside Radio, an M Street publication and database. ''Lots of markets that never had a Spanish station now do,'' Mr. Taylor said. He cited Raleigh, N.C., where last year the Curtis Media Group switched its station WYMY from an English-language 80's music format to a Spanish-language format featuring Mexican music.
