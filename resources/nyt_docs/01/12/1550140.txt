To the Editor:
Re ''For U.S. Aid, City Switches Reading Plan in 49 Schools'' (news article, Jan. 7):
New York's schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, is right to ask, ''Where's the science?'' supporting President Bush's ''scientifically proven'' Reading First mandates. Several analyses of the data, including my own, have revealed the vacuousness of the research offered to justify the legislation.
The instruction is not superior for teaching skills and comprehension. It provides no advantages for poor children, at-risk children or disabled readers. It is one more fiction undercutting public schools, driven by a political ideology that substitutes simplistic bootstrap answers for comprehensive social policy.
Most grievously, it creates false expectations in parents whose children will never achieve the academic success the Bush administration assures them will be theirs.
