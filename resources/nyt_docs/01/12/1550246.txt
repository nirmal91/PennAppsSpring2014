To the Editor:
''Young Doctors and Wish Lists: No Weekend Calls, No Beepers'' (front page, Jan. 7) discusses the pragmatic trend among medical residents, half of them women, who are choosing specialties with what is called a ''controllable lifestyle.''
One doctor, a woman, is quoted as saying: ''I want to have a family. And when you work 80 or 90 hours a week, you can't even take care of yourself.''
If only more men would now wake up and recognize that grueling, alienating workweeks serve neither a profession, patients, clients, the production of well-made products, nor families.
