To the Editor:
Thank you for publishing ''Young Doctors and Wish Lists: No Weekend Call, No Beepers'' (front page, Jan. 7) the day before interviews for our dermatology residency program. It was a reminder that we are looking for residents who chose the field for its content, with less concern for lifestyle.
Our residents are on call on the weekends and wear beepers. In addition to the cosmetic procedures mentioned in your article, they learn how to treat patients with severe dermatologic diseases.
If you love what you do, the day will fly by in an instant. If you are just looking for shorter hours without a genuine interest in the field, the day will seem interminable.
