An article on Thursday about plans by Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece to call early parliamentary elections and resign, a step expected to make room for Foreign Minister George Papandreou to succeed him as leader of the governing Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, misstated the period in which Mr. Papandreou's grandfather, also named George, was prime minister. It was 1963-1965, not the 1950's.
