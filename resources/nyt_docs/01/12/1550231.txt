An article on Jan. 4 about a Chinese government investigation of a Dec. 23 gas well explosion that killed 233 people in southwest China referred imprecisely to an official statistic on accidental workplace deaths. It covered only accidents in industrial workplaces like mines and factories, not all workplaces. The article also misstated the number of such deaths in the first nine months of 2003. It was 11,449, not 11,499.
