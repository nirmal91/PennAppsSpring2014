To the Editor:
America's Queen of the Seas, the ocean liner United States, was unfortunately overlooked in your Jan. 6 editorial ''The New Queen.''
Despite all the hoopla over Queen Mary 2, technologically it pales in comparison to our very own United States, which on its sea trials in April 1952 achieved an amazing 43 knots. It still holds the westbound Atlantic speed record, which it set on its maiden voyage on July 7, 1952. Nearly 1,000 feet long and 17 stories high, the Big U was outfitted with engines that could produce well in excess of 248,000 horsepower -- almost twice that of Queen Mary 2.
For many years, I have always felt that the Big U was a national treasure. In 1999, so did the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Too bad The Times did not see it that way.
