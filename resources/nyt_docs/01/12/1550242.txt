To the Editor:
Re ''Hazing and Heroism,'' by Tom Downey (Op-Ed, Jan. 9):
More than the evidence of firehouse anecdote is needed to make the case that insult and ridicule are the building blocks of camaraderie, let alone courage or heroism.
In the wake of the assault in a Staten Island firehouse last month, an act that was a direct result of hazing, one saw no courage, no heroism, only lies and cover-up.
