Marion Jones is expected to make her return to competition after a 17-month absence at the Millrose Games on Feb. 6 at Madison Square Garden.
Jones, who had her first child in June with the sprinter Tim Montgomery, is expected to compete in the 60-meter dash, said Howard Schmertz, the director emeritus of the meet.
The 97th Millrose Games will be her first official competition since completing the European Golden League and Grand Prix circuits in 2002.
The Millrose Games, which was purchased by Pro Sports &amp; Entertainment in the fall, will also feature significant revisions. The Mel Sheppard men's 600-yard race, last held in 1992, will return, along with the men's shot-put, last held at the Garden in the 1970's. A men's collegiate mile and a women's 1,000-yard race are expected to attract top national talent.
New events will include the Diane Dixon women's 500-yard race, 60-meter sprint and hurdles races for leading college and high school runners and ''fastest kid in New York'' dashes.
