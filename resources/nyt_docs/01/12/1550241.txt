To the Editor:
Re ''Hazing and Heroism,'' by Tom Downey (Op-Ed, Jan. 9):
New York's Bravest deserve to live and work in an environment that fosters the strong love that they have for one another and that honors the sacrifices they make daily to protect others.
''Busting chops'' produces hard people who are afraid of authority and who are turned off to their emotional lives and to the feelings of those around them.
It is an excuse to express rage or fear disguised as rage and as such is an invalid communication from one person to another.
Dulling the ability to feel makes it easier to see dead bodies in the short run, but lots harder to take in the living universe. It ruins family life, too.
The hazing culture prevalent in many firehouses damages our firefighters and should be replaced with a culture of loving respect that encourages real bonding.
