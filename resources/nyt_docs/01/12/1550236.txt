A sports article on Friday about the return of the former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy to Madison Square Garden as coach of the Houston Rockets omitted a job in his career history. He was an assistant coach at Rutgers for a year after coaching at Providence College and before joining the Knicks as an assistant coach.
A picture with the article in some editions, showing Van Gundy talking with Yao Ming of the Rockets, carried an incorrect credit. It was by Barton Silverman of The New York Times.
