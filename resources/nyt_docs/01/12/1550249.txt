To the Editor:
During my last year of medical school, I struggled with a choice between internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology (front page, Jan. 7). I chose internal medicine because I wanted a better lifestyle. A few months into my residency, I knew I had gone into internal medicine for the wrong reasons and switched to gynecology.
Even though I had to repeat an internship (the worst part of residency) and am under constant threat of being sued, I do not regret my choice -- I love what I do.
When I interviewed for jobs, I (as well as most of my classmates) chose a practice that believes in balance. In my office, we limit the number of deliveries a doctor does each month, we don't deliver babies for our own patients during call hours, and we each work only four days a week. We don't make fabulous salaries, but we make enough, and the free time is invaluable.
