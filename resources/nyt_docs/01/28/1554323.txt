To the Editor:
Your Jan. 26 front-page article ''Ex-Inspector Says C.I.A. Missed Disarray in Iraqi Arms Program'' points to poor intelligence before the invasion of Iraq.
David A. Kay, the administration's former chief weapons inspector, concludes that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.
It is time for an independent Congressional inquiry to assess what went wrong. The American public must not wait for years to know the truth -- if a blunder occurred and why, and how to repair our intelligence system.
