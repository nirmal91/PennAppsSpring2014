MGM Mirage, the casino developer, said yesterday that it would buy a racetrack owner, Wembley, for £270 million ($490 million). The deal, which has been approved by boards of both companies, will give MGM a foothold in Britain, where Wembley operates greyhound tracks in Wimbledon, Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford and Portsmouth. The deal is contingent on resolution of federal conspiracy and wire fraud charges against top executives of Wembley, which is based in London. MGM Mirage, based in Las Vegas, will pay £7.50 ($13.61) for each share of Wembley, or 22 percent more than its closing share price Monday.
