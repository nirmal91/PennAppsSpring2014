Re ''Ex-Inspector Says C.I.A. Missed Disarray in Iraqi Arms Program'' (front page, Jan. 26):
In the mid-80's, I worked in the United States intelligence arena. Even then, old-timers were concerned that the United States was relying so heavily on mechanical means (satellites and such) and had no dollars for human intelligence, or the person on the ground.
This problem has continued through this day, when we have to recruit Arabic speakers because we don't have many and when intelligence chatter was not sufficiently decoded before 9/11 instead of after.
We have chosen how to allocate scarce resources, and we didn't have enough to go around. That's the problem.
