Banana Republic, the retail chain owned by Gap Inc., has named Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco to handle strategic brand duties and creative duties for its print and outdoor advertising, which had been handled internally since 1997. Billings were estimated at $20 million.
The decision came after a three-month review that involved Goodby, Silverstein, part of the Omnicom Group, and four other agencies: a/R Media in New York; Laird &amp; Partners in New York, which helps create campaigns for the Gap division of Gap Inc.; Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe, which has been advising Gap Inc. on brand strategy for the Banana Republic and Gap divisions; and TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
