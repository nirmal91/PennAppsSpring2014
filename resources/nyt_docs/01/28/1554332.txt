To the Editor:
In lamenting the self-deprecating passivity of the female students she teaches at a ''select'' private college, Rhonda Garelick (Op-Ed, Jan. 24) doesn't consider the cultural isolation of that pastoral world. If she visited a City University classroom, she would encounter working-class women who speak passionately about the political and economic forces that shape their often difficult lives.
Unfortunately, their loud, clear voices are not always heard.
