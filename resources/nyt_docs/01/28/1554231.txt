During February, City Bakery, the cafe at 3 West 18th Street, will sell mugs of hot chocolate in a different flavor each day. To name a few: ginger, malted milk, bourbon, caramel and banana peel. Plain is $3, flavors are $4, and 50 cents buys homemade marshmallows. Above, a chocolate disk with your initials floats on the surface of monogrammed hot chocolate, another choice.
Other places are also trying to warm New York with comfort foods next month. At Brasserie Les Halles, 411 Park Avenue South (29th Street), and 15 John Street (Broadway), four kinds of choucroute, including duck and seafood, are on the menu, $18.50 to $23.50 at lunch and dinner. The Comfort Diners at 214 East 45th Street and 25 West 23rd Street have a month of creative grilled cheese sandwiches, $5.95 to $9.50, including Swiss and bratwurst on rye and Greek kasseri and spinach in pita.
And Rare Bar &amp; Grill, 303 Lexington Avenue (37th Street), is pairing its burgers with cheeses from the Artisanal Cheese Center, a new one each week through March 21. Prices are $12 to $23.
