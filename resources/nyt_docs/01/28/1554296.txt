Russia's prosecution of Yukos Oil is becoming an international manhunt.
Yuri S. Biryukov, the first deputy prosecutor general, said Tuesday that a court had placed 10 of the company's shareholders or employees on international wanted lists, including some senior executives who have sought asylum in Israel.
The disclosure suggested that the prosecution of Yukos was extending far beyond its former chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, and his partner, Platon Lebedev, who both remain in prison in Moscow.
Mr. Biryukov, in remarks to the Interfax news agency, identified only three of the 10 now wanted by Russia. They were Leonid B. Nevzlin, the largest shareholder who is not in prison; Mikhail B. Brudno, the president of the company's marketing department; and Vladimir M. Dubov, a shareholder and until last year a member of Parliament. All three are now in Israel.
Neither Mr. Biryukov nor other officials in the general prosecutor's office would identify the other seven.
A court in Moscow on Tuesday rejected a complaint filed by Mr. Khodorkovsky's lawyer challenging his arrest at gunpoint on a Siberian airfield in October. Mr. Khodorkovsky has been in prison ever since, with courts repeatedly rejecting his lawyers' request for his release on bail.
Mr. Biryukov said Mr. Nevzlin, Mr. Dubov and Mr. Brudno all faced charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion related to companies or subsidiaries controlled by Mr. Khodorkovsky.
Alexandre Konanykhine, a former banking associate of Mr. Khodorkovsky now in the United States, is also wanted on fraud charges in Russia. He said last month that American officials were trying to deport him to Russia to testify against Mr. Khodorkovsky. But on Tuesday, federal immigration officials in Virginia reopened his deportation hearings -- ensuring, his lawyers said, that it will be several years, if ever, before he has to return to Russia.
