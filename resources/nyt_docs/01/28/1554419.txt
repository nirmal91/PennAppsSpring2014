Schools will be closed throughout New York City today, officials said last night as snow blanketed the city in yet another winter storm.
Four inches of snow had fallen in Central Park by midnight, the National Weather Service said. In all, the storm was expected to bring five to nine inches of snow to the city. It capped a spate of days of bitterly cold weather.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced the schools closing about 7 p.m. Regents examinations scheduled for today will be rescheduled, officials said.
''Given the potential severity of the storm, closing schools for Wednesday makes sense,'' Randi Weingarten, the president of the city teachers' union, said in a statement.
New York City, with 1.1 million students and 1,200 schools, is the largest school system in the country.
By 9:30 p.m., the thick snowfall had caused flight delays and cancellations at airports in the New York region. Flights at La Guardia Airport were delayed up to an hour, with 183 cancellations. At Newark Liberty International Airport, 269 flights had been canceled.
In Manhattan last night, many people used umbrellas. Sidewalks were empty and cars glided slowly along the avenues. Drifting snow made curbs indistinguishable from the road.
A Domino's delivery man walked his bicycle, a pizza in its basket, along Eighth Avenue.
Further uptown, a visitor from Miami, Freddy Levy, dressed in a thin leather coat, shivered. ''I'm freezing,'' he said. ''I can't take it anymore.''
Others took pleasure in the quiet whiteness.
''This is just the right temperature,'' said Oren Shulman, who was sweeping snow from the sidewalk in front of his building on West 14th Street. ''It makes perfect snowballs.''
