A gun collector who the authorities said kept a cache of unlicensed weapons in his home has been charged with weapons possession, the Queens district attorney announced yesterday. Last week, the police executed a warrant at the home of the collector, Bruce Steinfelder, 55, of 58th Road in Flushing, and found 69 weapons, including 51 pistols, 8 assault weapons, 4 shotguns and 6 rifles, the authorities said, adding that 25 of the weapons were unlicensed. Upon running a check, the authorities discovered that Mr. Steinfelder had failed to renew a pistol permit from 1976, the official said. His lawyer did not return a call for comment yesterday.
