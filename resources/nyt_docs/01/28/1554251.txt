To the Editor:
Re ''War of Ideas, Part 6,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 25):
It is certainly true that there is inadequate economic opportunity for Arab youth in their own countries. It is also true that there is great anger and frustration on the part of many young Arabs, and that we find ourselves fighting a war against terrorism in response to the most virulent strains of this anger.
But it's not at all clear that economic problems are at the root of terrorism. Many of the 9/11 hijackers were middle-class, educated individuals, and Osama bin Laden himself is a product of affluence. Many of the Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel have been young people with educations or even professions.
Conversely, there are millions of people throughout the world who are suffering greater economic hardship, and who are subject to comparable deprivation of political liberties in their countries, who are not resorting to terrorism as a response to their plight.
