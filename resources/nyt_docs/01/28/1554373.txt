Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury goods manufacturer behind Waterford crystal and Wedgwood porcelain, may sell its All-Clad cookware division after receiving ''significant, unsolicited third-party interest,'' the company said, without identifying the potential buyer. Waterford bought All-Clad for $110 million in 1999, and its former chairman, Sam Michaels, is now one of Waterford's directors. The company also reported revenue of 241.9 million euros ($305.4 million) for the fourth quarter last year, which was unchanged from the same period in 2002, and was sustained by an 11 percent increase in its Japanese sales.
