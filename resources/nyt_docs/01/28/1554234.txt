There is nothing like chili to take the chill off a wintry Midtown street. Daisy May's BBQ USA, which has a takeout store on 11th Avenue and 46th Street, has rolled out the first two of six snappy-looking chili carts, one at Avenue of the Americas and 50th Street, and the other at Broadway and 39th Street.
From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, the carts sell chili in a 12-ounce cup with a flour tortilla and a garnish of shredded cheese and sour cream, all for $6. The chili, or ''bowl o' red,'' as Adam Perry Lang, below, the chef and owner, calls it, is made with cubes of beef in a forcefully warming sauce that blends three or four kinds of fresh, dried, roasted and smoked chilis. There are no tomatoes. Beans and rice are optional.
For the Super Bowl on Sunday, Daisy May has a $20 package at the store containing chili, ribs, barbecued chicken, coleslaw and potato salad, enough for at least four people. Delivery is available, and orders can be picked up at the store from 2 to 6 p.m. : (212) 977-1500.
