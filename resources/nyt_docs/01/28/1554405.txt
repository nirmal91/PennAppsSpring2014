Parents and educators urged the trustees of the State University of New York on Tuesday to give a failing Harlem charter school two more years to turn things around. The board postponed a decision until next month.
Earlier this month, state evaluators from the SUNY Charter School Institute recommended closing the school, the John A. Reisenbach Charter School, one of the first three charter schools in New York. It cited poor test scores, high teacher and student turnover and other issues.
But supporters of the school said the recommendation was premature and was primarily based on the eighth-grade state tests taken by only 15 percent of the school's total student population. School officials said they had not prepared their students in advance for the exam, therefore making a direct comparison with other schools irrelevant.
''The performance of a single class does not accurately reflect the performance of the school as a whole,'' said Edmund Wingate, a board member of the Learning Project, a nonprofit group that manages the school. ''If we had just four more students pass the exam, we would have achieved best-in-district performance.''
Of the 69 eighth-grade students tested last year, only 13 percent met state standards in English and 7 percent met state standards in math. The school scored below the average performance of students in Harlem Community School District 5, one of the lowest-scoring districts in New York City.
James D. Merriman, executive director of the SUNY Charter School Institute, said he stood by the recommendation to close the school, regardless of the pleas by parents, because the school had failed to be recognized as a model for excellence in public education. ''Based on their past performance, not on what they plan to do in the future, Reisenbach has not met the terms of its charter to function in an educationally sound manner,'' he said.
