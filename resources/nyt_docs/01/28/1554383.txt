More than 15,000 people marched on the capital, Port-au-Prince, in the latest in a series of large-scale demonstrations demanding the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. For a second straight day the protesters marched through the city largely without incident but still closely watched by the national police force, which in recent weeks has clashed with demonstrators. The protest came as President Aristide prepared to meet this week with leaders of other Caribbean nations who have called on him to take immediate steps to resolve the political crisis.
