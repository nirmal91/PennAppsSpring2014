To the Editor:
In response to a Yale study showing an association between the older dark hair dyes and cancer (news article, Jan. 24), the vice president for science at the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association dismisses the research because it is observational rather than clinical. A clinical study would select a representative group of women, randomly assign half to use the dyes and half to abstain, and wait more than 20 years to see how many get cancer.
If that is the industry's standard of proof, it should do that study before it markets its products.
