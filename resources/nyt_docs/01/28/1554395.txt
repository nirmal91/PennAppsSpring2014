One of Japan's largest semiconductor makers, NEC Electronics, earned 8.3 billion yen ($78.3 million) in the October-December quarter last year, a jump of 77 percent compared with the same period in 2002. The surge came despite a 5.6 percent slide in sales. NEC Electronics was spun off from the NEC Corporation, one of Japan's largest computer and telecommunications companies, last July.
