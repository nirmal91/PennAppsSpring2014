To the Editor:
Re ''Career Girls,'' by Rhonda Garelick (Op-Ed, Jan. 24):
It is a truism these days that young women have forsaken feminism because they believe that sex discrimination is no longer important. Too bad that's just not true.
Passionate conversations about sexual assault on campus, eating disorders, the war in Iraq and other feminist issues were commonplace at Columbia University, from which I graduated last spring.
''The most important education you'll ever get at college comes outside of a classroom,'' one of my professors once said. Likewise, feminist dialogue emerges more often among peers than in class.
Online journals, zines and late-night dormitory discussions allow for self-examination and discussion, without the stress of being graded on your deeply personal thoughts.
Our feminism is incipient, not nonexistent.
