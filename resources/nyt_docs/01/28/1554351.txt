The Walt Disney Company released financial documents on Tuesday showing that its chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, received a raise last year and that he also agreed to take responsibility for lapses in disclosure as part of an investigation by federal regulators.
Mr. Eisner received salary of $1 million in 2003 and a stock bonus valued at $6.25 million, according to the company's annual report, up from $5 million in stock he received in 2002.
The disclosure came on the day that Roy Disney, the nephew of the company's founder, and Stanley Gold, who both quit the board recently, sent a letter to shareholders suggesting that they not vote for Mr. Eisner and other directors in the coming board election.
Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney are hoping to gain enough investor support to oust Mr. Eisner, whom they have criticized over the last two years as responsible for the company's lackluster performance. Since quitting the board, the two have not come up with a plan to replace management. Instead, they are taking their case to Wall Street in the hope of putting pressure on Mr. Eisner to leave. A spokeswoman for Disney said the letter was an attempt ''to mislead the shareholders.''
In its filing, Disney said that it was working toward a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding an investigation related to disclosures about its board. The company said last year that it was being investigated by regulators for not disclosing that relatives of several board members had links to Disney or a company it controlled. As part of the settlement, which would include Mr. Eisner's acceptance of responsibility for parts of the lapse in disclosure, the company would agree to an ''administrative cease-and-desist order.''
Disney, which has been criticized for having a weak board, has been trying to strengthen it.
