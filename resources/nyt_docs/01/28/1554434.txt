Federal environmental officials have fined Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center $214,420 for improperly disposing of chemotherapy waste and other hazardous materials. The Environmental Protection Agency discovered the violations during a random inspection of the hospital last March. Chemicals used for chemotherapy, along with dental fillings, which contain mercury, were kept in standard red biohazard containers, but regulations require more specific identification of the content, Elizabeth Zimmerman, an agency spokeswoman, said yesterday. Christine Hickey, a hospital spokeswoman, said the chemotherapy chemicals were originally handled and labeled as regulated medical waste and not as hazardous chemical waste, as regulations require. Since the violations were noted, the hospital has been using the more specific terms, she said.
