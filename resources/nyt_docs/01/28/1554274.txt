Byron Scott took a moment Tuesday to imagine himself back in the N.B.A., coaching against the Nets, staring across the court at Jason Kidd.
Scott has said he does not believe that Kidd orchestrated his firing on Monday, but at this point, he cannot be sure of anything. He was taken aback in the summer by reports that Kidd demanded his ouster, was on the wrong end of Kidd's tirade last month in Memphis, and is now surrounded by speculation that Kidd and his agent, Jeff Schwartz, tried to persuade the team's president, Rod Thorn, to make the final move.
''I think at some point Jason and I will run across each other again,'' Scott said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''It will be cordial, friendly. I never really thought we had a problem, but that's just coming from me. Sometimes, you wish you were a fly on the wall of some of those meetings because I don't know what has gone on behind closed doors.''
Although Thorn denies having received any thoughts from Schwartz or any players on the coaching change, and Kidd was angry at the mere suggestion that he had a role in the move, Scott has undoubtedly been cast as a sympathetic figure.
Having left the Nets in first place in the Atlantic Division, Scott is receiving little support from his former players, most of whom offer only veiled criticisms. Scott refuses to respond and has expressed more appreciation to the Nets than resentment.
''I have no bad feelings about what happened,'' Scott said. ''I still look at Rod as a father figure and have a lot of respect for him and the organization and the team. I still think my relationship with Jason was pretty good. Obviously, I wish I could have finished this season, but I know how things go. I wish everyone the best.''
