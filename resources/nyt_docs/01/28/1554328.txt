To the Editor:
Rhonda Garelick's portrayal of the similarity between the attitudes of 1950's college students in the movie ''Mona Lisa Smile'' and the unenlightened views of students half a century later was painful to read (''Career Girls,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 24).
As a graduate of the first Radcliffe College class to receive Harvard degrees (in 1963), I can well recall the devastating double message delivered by our education: we were very bright, and our education would prepare us to be better wives and mothers.
Fortunate to graduate on the cusp of the 60's, when the idea of ''a woman's proper place'' as a subordinate was, I thought, finally put to rest, many of us went on to have careers as well as families. Yet what Ms. Garelick calls ''the pool of Lethe,'' a near total ignorance of political history, is a major factor in the complacency of today's college students.
I went to see ''Mona Lisa Smile'' with my 16-year-old daughter. ''Was it really like that, Mom?'' she asked as we left the theater.
Recalling how classmates shared an enlightened doctor's name because birth control was then illegal in Massachusetts, I had to answer in the affirmative.
