Khawar Mehdi Rizvi, the Pakistani journalist arrested last month after travelling with two French journalists to Quetta without government permission, appeared in a Quetta court and was charged with sedition and conspiracy, which carry a potential life sentence. The French journalists were deported, but Mr. Rizvi had not been seen or heard from until the court appearance.
