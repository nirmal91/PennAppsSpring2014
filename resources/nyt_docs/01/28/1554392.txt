It was a day of regression for Lisa Raymond. After talking a good game and playing a better one on her way to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, she slipped back into old, painful patterns against Patty Schnyder with a semifinal spot well within reach.
Instead, in an error-filled match, it was Schnyder, the clever and quick left-hander from Switzerland, who took advantage of the opportunity with a 7-6 (2), 6-3 victory Wednesday.
Next for Schnyder is second-seeded Kim Clijsters, a 6-2, 7-6 (9) winner over Anastasia Myskina, but only after she received treatment on her fragile left ankle in the second set after aggravating it while moving forward for a shot.
Clijsters sprained the ankle at the Hopman Cup earlier this month, and when she took her injury timeout Wednesday, she was trailing, 1-4. But she proceeded to rally, with a lot of help from a shaky Myskina, saving five set points to close out the match. ''I'm going to have a week off after this,'' Clijsters said. ''I might as well go for it and give it a shot.''
Raymond looked as tense under pressure as she had appeared comfortable in her stirring, straight-set victory over Venus Williams in the third round. At age 30, Raymond was hoping that performance would usher in a new phase of her career.
''I don't think I've been this disappointed losing a match,'' she said. ''I really thought I had a good shot of having a breakthrough here.''
It looked possible when she broke Schnyder at 5-5 in the opening set. But when Raymond served for the set, she failed to win a point, making four errors. ''To be honest, I didn't really feel comfortable the whole match,'' Raymond said.
