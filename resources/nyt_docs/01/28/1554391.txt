An 88-year-old doctor has been indicted for the killing of a mentally ill patient in 1941 under the ''euthanasia'' program through which the Nazis intended to fashion an unblemished master Aryan race, prosecutors in Gera said. The doctor, Rosemarie Albrecht, is suspected of giving the patient a fatal dose of sleeping pills while she worked in the psychiatric ward at a hospital in Stadtroda, near Jena, from 1940 to 1942. During her service, other patients died under mysterious circumstances, prosecutors said.
