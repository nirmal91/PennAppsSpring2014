To the Editor:
Take heart, Prof. Rhonda Garelick (''Career Girls,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 24).
After more than a decade of college teaching, I have met many an apathetic student. But every semester I always reach someone, sometimes more than one.
Teach for these people. It takes only one individual to begin a movement.
