To the Editor:
In ''Mr. Cheney, Meet Mr. Kay'' (editorial, Jan. 27) , you say David A. Kay, the administration's former chief weapons inspector, ''largely exonerates President Bush and blames the global intelligence community'' for maintaining that Iraq had been trying to make W.M.D.
You add that Mr. Kay ''believes the C.I.A. became so reliant on the much-maligned United Nations weapons inspectors that their withdrawal left it without spies of its own.'' Indeed, France, Germany and Russia wanted the inspectors to continue their search.
It is hard to believe that United States intelligence could have been so off-base. It appears that the administration spent much effort embellishing intelligence information.
