A dollop of strong seasoning is often all that is needed to punch up a soup, a plate of grilled fish or skewered chicken. Adriana's Caravan at Grand Central Market, Lexington Avenue and 43rd Street, is selling more than a dozen kinds of Charmaine Solomon's seasoning pastes and marinades in 9-ounce jars. Among the choices are a tartly spicy Thai barbecue marinade, an earthily hot Moroccan spice blend and a suave butter chicken sauce. Each is labeled according to its spiciness, starting with mild. Toasty Sri Lanka curry paste is accurately marked hot, but is still not hair-raising. There are easy recipes on the jars, which usually call for half the contents for a dish to serve 6. They are $12.95 a jar.
