Japan's last maker of bulk DRAM memory chips, Elpida Memory, will ask the Japanese government to impose tariffs on chips made by Hynix Semiconductor of South Korea. Elpida says that Hynix unfairly benefits from subsidies from the South Korean government. Creditors have bailed out Hynix several times in recent years. Elpida is a venture of Hitachi and NEC and competes in a market that Japanese producers once dominated.
