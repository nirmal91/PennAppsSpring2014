Zimbabwe's autocratic 79-year-old president, Robert Mugabe, confirmed news accounts that he had secretly visited South Africa over the weekend but denied that he had sought emergency medical treatment there, as had been widely reported. Speaking in Zimbabwe, Mr. Mugabe said he had gone to South Africa to give a nephew 5,000 rand, or about $700, to pay for his bride as part of a traditional marriage ceremony. Mr. Mugabe, who has been dogged by reports of ill health, proclaimed himself ''very strong.''
