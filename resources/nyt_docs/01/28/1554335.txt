To the Editor:
The value and need for human intimacy so poignantly portrayed in ''In Death Watch for Stranger, Becoming a Friend to the End'' (front page, Jan. 25) was both heartbreaking and inspiring.
The enormity of human suffering is painful to grasp. Despite this enormity, Bill Keating's friendship with Lew Grossman demonstrated how two human beings can tremendously enrich one another's lives.
As I read this powerful article, I felt the strength of their friendship. I pictured the smile on Mr. Grossman's face when he was with Mr. Keating. I could taste the rich chocolate cake they savored.
Surely they were dancing to Glenn Miller's music, even though Mr. Grossman said he wouldn't. And the laughter that a simple joke evokes reminded me of the resilience of human nature. Mr. Keating and Mr. Grossman became ''great buddies.''
I have my share of obstacles in life. We all do. But the story of these two remarkable men inspires me to become someone's great buddy. I hope that others feel that inspiration, too.
