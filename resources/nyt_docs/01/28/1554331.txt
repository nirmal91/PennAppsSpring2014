To the Editor:
Since the early 1990's, complaints about student disengagement have become common. Rhonda Garelick's contribution (''Career Girls,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 24) is clarifying, for it reveals just how political this complaint is.
How dare students in her class reject feminism! The outrage, that students in a French class would rather discuss French subjects than sit through left-wing criticism of the president's foreign policy!
Professor Garelick is correct: there is a generation gap. There is a reason campus antiwar protests feature more gray-haired professors than students.
But the generation gap is not a problem to be solved. Students should not be forced to believe what their professors believe, but must be free to explore their own ideas.
