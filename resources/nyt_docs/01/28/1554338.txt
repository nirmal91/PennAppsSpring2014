To the Editor:
The story of the unlikely friendship of Lew Grossman and Bill Keating (front page, Jan. 25) was profoundly touching. With doughnuts and Tommy Dorsey, two men forged a connection because Mr. Keating honored his own good fortune through his involvement as a doula, a companion to the terminally ill.
In an age where we can become inured to the suffering of others, this story serves to highlight what can make our time on earth even more meaningful. That when we seek to give service to others, we earn a legacy by which we and they are best remembered.
