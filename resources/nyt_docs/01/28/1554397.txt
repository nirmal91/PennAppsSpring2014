Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said he had had get-acquainted conversations with the team's new defensive coordinator, Tim Lewis, and the new defensive line coach, Mike Waufle, but he had not spoken to Coach Tom Coughlin, who has been on the job for three weeks.
Strahan made an appearance here Tuesday and said he was excited about the Giants' next season, but had no idea about the man who will be leading it.
''I don't know what his style is,'' he said. ''I can't go by what other guys think. I have to experience it first-hand. I'm interested to see how it's going to go.''
Strahan said he liked the choice of Lewis, who was recently fired as Pittsburgh's defensive coordinator, and said he was not upset that Coughlin had not called him. He said he did not remember whether Jim Fassel called when he took the job seven years ago.
Strahan, whose hometown is Houston, said he would leave from here to go to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii next week. When he returns to his home in New Jersey, he said he would talk to defensive lineman Keith Hamilton. Strahan said he finished the season believing Hamilton, a 12-year veteran, was planning to retire.
''He definitely has the skills to continue to play,'' Strahan said. ''He will hopefully make the decision that makes him happy. I can't be selfish and hope he plays just because I'm still there.''
