To the Editor:
Re ''Ex-Inspector Says C.I.A. Missed Disarray in Iraqi Arms Program'' (front page, Jan. 26):
The complete intelligence failure described by David A. Kay, the former chief weapons inspector, gives pause to wonder: What other impending intelligence failures are on the horizon? Libya? Iran? North Korea?
That the failure was so complete, from the analyst level up to and including the president, does not bode well for the future foreign policy challenges that the Bush administration will face.
