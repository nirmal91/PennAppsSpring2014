To the Editor:
Re ''Mr. Cheney, Meet Mr. Kay'' (editorial, Jan. 27):
David A. Kay's contention that President Bush is not to blame for the intelligence community's wildly inaccurate estimates of Iraq's W.M.D. programs is unacceptable.
During my first day in the Marine Corps (Oct. 10, 1966), I became familiar with the phrase ''No excuse, sir.'' Today, unfortunately, that phrase seems to be increasingly less applicable the higher one advances in position and power.
It appears that when one reaches the exalted rank of President Bush, it is not necessary to take any responsibility or even to blame anyone for blunders that occur on his watch.
His subordinates will do that for him.
