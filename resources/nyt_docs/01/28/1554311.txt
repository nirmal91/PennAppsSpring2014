Host of the ''Tonight Show'' from 1957 to 1962 -- sandwiched chronologically between Steve Allen and Johnny Carson, two other authentic giants -- Jack Paar entertained a nation of insomniacs with witty, silly, self-revealing, and, by today's standards, remarkably literate conversation. He was charming, sentimental, volatile and innovative, helping to pioneer the modern talk show with its now familiar accouterments: the host's desk, the couch full of guests, the obligatory band, and, oh, yes, the opening monologue.
It was in his hands, too, that the talk show became an established platform for political figures seeking to show their warm, personal side -- beginning a trend that, for better and worse, continues to exert outsized influence on the country's political life.
Mr. Paar died yesterday at 85. Looking back, it seems clear that a big reason for his success was that he was as good a listener as he was a talker. He could also tell jokes on himself. His opening line upon returning to the show in March 1960 -- he had quit on the air a month earlier after NBC's censors had cut an innocuous bathroom story -- was classic Paar: ''As I was saying before I was interrupted. . . .''
Though the censorship dispute that spurred his protest may now seem quaint, Mr. Paar's humor and humanity seem as modern as ever.
