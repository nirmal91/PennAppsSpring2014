Swifty's, the bistro at 1007 Lexington Avenue (73rd Street) which is popular with social A-list types, is now making its own ice creams and sorbets in flavors to tempt even dieting ladies who lunch. Not to be missed are green apple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon sorbets and coffee, hazelnut and chocolate chip ice cream, shown at left, in addition to eggnog and bracing peppermint. But the star might well be a sublimely mellow vanilla. A plate with two scoops is $8. A pint is $5 at R.S.V.P., Swifty's catering shop and cafe, 1012 Lexington Avenue.
