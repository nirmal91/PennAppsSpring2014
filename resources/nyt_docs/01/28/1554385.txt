A rash of drug-related killings and deaths has swept Mexico in the past week, and federal and state authorities have no solid explanation for the violence. Eleven bodies have been unearthed at a suspected drug trafficker's house in Ciudad Ju√°rez, and three men were killed in Nuevo Laredo, both cities on the Texas border. Two federal drug agents and an army captain were killed in Mexico City. A former deputy state attorney general was shot to death in Tijuana along with three other people. Five more deaths took place in the drug-growing state of Sinaloa. Theories voiced regarding the spate of killings include turf wars and score-settlings among drug gangs and corrupt government officials working with them.
