The nominees for this year's Oscars had a variety of reactions yesterday, from shocked to philosophical. These are some of them.
Peter Jackson, whose ''Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' received 11 nominations:
''The diversity this year is really cool. The range, the genres, the directors from different countries, the budgets -- it's great. It's just great. Cinema should be like that. There should be something for everybody.''
Samantha Morton, nominated for best actress for ''In America'':
''It's quite an intimate movie, but it seemed massive in what they go through. Family life is an epic. You don't need to have guns blazing and 600,000 extras for a movie to be big.''
Sofia Coppola, writer and director of ''Lost in Translation,'' who called to wake her father, Francis Ford Coppola, early Tuesday morning to tell him that her movie had been nominated for best picture and she had been nominated for best director:
''I definitely feel part of my family of creative people; I'm not trying to get away from that. But I'm happy to be recognized for my own work.''
Naomi Watts, a best actress nominee for ''21 Grams'':
''It's not about -- 'Oh look, we get to look ugly.' It's about telling the story of a woman who's suffering and about her emotional inner life, stripped bare. It's not about, 'Isn't this exciting, we get to put on weird prosthetic makeup.' ''
Djimon Hounsou, a supporting actor nominee for ''In America'':
''So much of me is here in this story, coming to America, for the dream. It is overwhelming to be part of that story. It defines so much of what contemporary America is.''
''I sound so composed,'' he said, ''but you should see my insides.''
