India's biggest business conglomerate, the Reliance Group, said it planned to set up the world's largest gas-run power plant to generate 3,500-megawatts of power. The $2.2 billion project is to be in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The natural gas for the plant will come from the group's gas fields on the coast of the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh.
