The State Board of Electric Generation Siting and the Environment yesterday rejected a power company's application to build a 520-megawatt plant off 22nd Street because it had not been completely filed before Jan. 1, 2003, when a program for accelerated decisions on proposed sites expired. The decision was a blow for the Sunset Energy Fleet company, which wanted to build a floating power plant at the end of a pier. ''It's a major victory,'' said Elizabeth C. Yeampierre, executive director of the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park, a community group. John W. Dax, a lawyer representing the company, declined to comment on the decision.
