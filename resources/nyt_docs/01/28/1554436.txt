Senator Jon S. Corzine, a leading Democratic fund-raiser and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, announced yesterday that he would back Senator John Kerry for the party's presidential nomination, citing his commitment to rebuilding international coalitions in fighting terrorism. Senator Corzine's announcement came on the morning of the nation's first primary, in New Hampshire, and five weeks after Gov. James E. McGreevey endorsed Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.
