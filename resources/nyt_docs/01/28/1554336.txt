The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld a settlement in 29-year-old litigation to desegregate Mississippi's public universities, five of them historically white and three historically black. The settlement calls for the state to allocate $503 million over 17 years toward improvements to balance the universities' quality and further integrate them. It was approved by most of the parties, including the federal government, which had joined the plaintiffs in suing the state. Some plaintiffs, contending that the settlement's financing was insufficient, sought to have it voided and asked permission to continue litigating. The court denied the requests.
