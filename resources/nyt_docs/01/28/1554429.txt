A woman who was convicted of killing three of her newborn children, whose corpses she transported around the country for at least a decade until abandoning them in an Arizona shed, was sentenced in Sullivan County Court yesterday to 25 years to life in prison. Evidence at the trial showed that the woman, Dianne Odell, 50, did not want the children because she was not married at the time, District Attorney Stephen F. Lungen said. The infants, born in 1982, 1983 and 1985, died shortly after their births in Kauneonga Lake, where Ms. Odell was living. Ms. Odell, who continues to maintain her innocence, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder in December. Judge Frank LaBuda sentenced her to 15 years to life for the first child, 20 to life for the second and 25 to life for the third, with the sentences to run concurrently.
