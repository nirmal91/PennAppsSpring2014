The Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee, part of SABMiller, has expanded its agency roster by naming the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., to create television commercials for Miller Genuine Draft beer. Although billings could not be determined, Miller spent an estimated $35 million last year advertising the brand, which has suffered steep sales declines recently.
Martin, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, becomes the fourth agency creating commercials for Miller Brewing, which has moved away from assigning individual agencies to particular brands and toward a more fluid division of labor. The other Miller agencies are Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., and two agencies owned by the WPP Group: Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York and the Chicago office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising.
