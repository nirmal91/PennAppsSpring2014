The European Commission has decided to postpone a decision to take legal action against Germany for failing to scrap a law that grants the German carmaker Volkswagen unfair protection from foreign takeovers, a spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said. The commission was expected to begin legal action this week, but Mr. Todd said Germany was being given ''one last chance'' to bring the so-called VW law into line with rules to protect the free movement of capital throughout the European Union.
