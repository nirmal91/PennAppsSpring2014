To the Editor:
Re ''Placement of Women in Senior Posts Stirs Debate at Princeton'' (Education page, Jan. 21):
The Princeton students are in for a rude awakening. As a woman who has fought her way through the academic minefield for 30-plus years, I have come to realize that women who reach high levels in the administration at elite colleges have to be tougher and better qualified than the men.
The young conservative men of Princeton need to contemplate the career of Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, who was the first female provost at Stanford University. I doubt that Saddam Hussein thinks that she's ''maternalistic.''
