To the Editor:
In bypassing strong Democratic opposition in the Senate and making a recess appointment of the controversial judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (front page, Jan. 17), President Bush has utterly reneged on his 2000 campaign claim to be a ''uniter, not a divider.''
