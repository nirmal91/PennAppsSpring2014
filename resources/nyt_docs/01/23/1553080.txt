The Walt Disney Company has sold the town center of Celebration to Lexin Capital, a real estate investment company, for an undisclosed price. The purchase encompasses 18 acres containing 16 retail shops, six restaurants and 105 apartments. Lexin agreed to retain the architectural design standards established by Disney, which opened the town in 1996.
