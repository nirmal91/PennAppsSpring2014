He was definitely skinnier, and it showed on his face, which seemed tauter than usual. He looked very well rested, the occasional puffiness under his eyes diminished.
But had Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy undergone cosmetic surgery or not?
On Thursday night, Mr. Bersluconi stepped before television cameras on a street here -- the first time journalists got a close look at him in about a month -- and did not solve a mystery that has riveted many Italians.
Mr. Berlusconi said that during a period of uncharacteristic invisibility since late December, he had made efforts to get into better physical shape.
But in his brief comments, he did not actually confirm or deny rampant speculation that evolved into outright assumption, as the front page of Il Foglio, a newspaper partly owned by his wife, made clear Thursday.
''Frankenstein,'' said a headline above the fold.
The paragraph that followed said that ''the world waits to see what new face'' Mr. Berlusconi had made for himself.
Mr. Berlusconi told reporters on Thursday night, ''I had a lot of fun reading all of the fantasies that have come out in the newspapers.''
Some newspaper reports mentioned speculation that Mr. Berlusconi's extremely low profile since just before Christmas was due to illness.
He battled prostate cancer in the late 1990's.
But his aides have said that the prime minister was not dealing with any serious health problems.
