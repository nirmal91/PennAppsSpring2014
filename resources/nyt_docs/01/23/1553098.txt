An article on Dec. 5 about Interpol's decision to put former President Charles G. Taylor of Liberia on its most-wanted list misidentified the issuing authority of an arrest warrant for Mr. Taylor, who has been indicted for atrocities committed during a 10-year war in neighboring Sierra Leone. As Interpol informed The Times last week, the warrant was issued by the United Nations-sponsored Special Court for Sierra Leone, not Sierra Leone itself. The article also misstated the response from Nigeria, where Mr. Taylor lives in exile. Nigeria has ignored the court's arrest warrant, not rejected an extradition request.
