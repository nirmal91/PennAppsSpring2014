Joe Namath, whose bizarre behavior during a sideline report in December raised eyebrows, admitted in an interview with ESPN to be broadcast Sunday that he is seeking professional help for an alcohol problem.
Namath, the quarterback who led the Jets to their only Super Bowl championship, said that every time something has gone askew in his life, alcohol has been involved.
On Dec. 20, he slurred his words and twice told the ESPN sideline reporter Suzy Kolber on camera that he wanted to kiss her.
''I can't believe it, and I didn't even see it, and I don't want to see it,'' Namath told ESPN, referring to a tape of the interview. ''That was the wake-up call. Even before that, I said, 'Yeah, I'm going to stop, I'm going to stop.' I stopped, and, like I say, I stopped for a few weeks, I stopped for a week, I stopped for two weeks, and then go back and drink a couple of days. Not constantly, just a couple, few drinks. I can't handle it.''
Namath, who was at the Jets' game against New England last month at Giants Stadium as part of the celebration of their all-time team, told ESPN he had been drinking since 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. that day. Kolber interviewed Namath during the first half of the game, which began at 8:30 p.m. Namath has since apologized to her.
''For the best interests of Joe, it's a positive to do what he's doing,'' Ron Colangelo, a Jets spokesman, said. ''It's good he's doing what he feels he needs to do, and we're certainly supportive of him.''
