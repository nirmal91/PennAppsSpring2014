Three of the five homeless men who have admitted robbing, beating and raping a woman near Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 2002 were sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court in Queens. Luis Carmona, 21, and Armando Juvenal, 21, were sentenced to 22 years in jail, and Carlos Rodriguez, 23, to 23 years. The three men pleaded guilty in December to sexually assaulting a 42-year-old woman in a homeless encampment near the park on Dec. 19, 2002. A fourth man, Victor Cruz, 23, was sentenced last week to 21 years in prison. The fifth defendant will be sentenced next month.
