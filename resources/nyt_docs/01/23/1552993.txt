To the Editor:
Although I have been a supporter of Howard Dean, I agreed with much of William Safire's Jan. 21 column, ''Dean: Too Old to Cry.''
There is, however, a disturbing double standard at work these days: political pundits freely pass judgment upon Democratic candidates while ignoring George W. Bush's unpresidential behavior, speech and intellect.
Pundits call John Kerry ''aloof'' and ''patrician''; they describe Dr. Dean as both ''chilly'' and a ''hothead.''
To be fair, they should also observe that President Bush often wears a smirk, that he is chronically inarticulate (often to the point of incoherence), and that his geopolitical worldview is na√Øve and simplistic.
Yet even in letters to the editor, such observations do not see print. (Feel free to prove me wrong.)
