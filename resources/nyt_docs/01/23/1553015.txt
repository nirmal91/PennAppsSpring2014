One week was enough for NBC to stand by and watch as ''The Apprentice,'' its promising new reality series featuring Donald J. Trump, was pummeled in the ratings Wednesday night by ''American Idol'' on the Fox network.
Not wanting to risk losing one of its few new potential hit series to the ''American Idol'' juggernaut, NBC moved yesterday to shift ''The Apprentice'' back to Thursday, revamping that night and Tuesday as well.
Starting next week, NBC's Thursday night lineup will be ''Friends'' at 8, ''Will and Grace'' at 8:30, ''The Apprentice'' at 9 and ''E.R.'' at 10.
NBC will move the comedy ''Scrubs'' from Thursday to Tuesday at 9:30, after ''Frasier.'' The comedy ''Whoopi'' moves back to 8 followed by ''Happy Family'' at 8:30. NBC will concede the Wednesday at 8 spot to ''American Idol'' by filling it with repeats of ''The Apprentice.''
''The Apprentice'' made its debut earlier this month on Thursday night, and in its first two weeks it drew 18.5 million viewers and 20.2 million viewers. But on its regular Wednesday night slot this week it drew just 12.3 million viewers against the 29.4 million viewers of ''American Idol,'' which began its new season this week.
