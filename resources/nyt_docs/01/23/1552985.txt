To the Editor:
Re ''As Consumers Revolt, a Rush to Block Pop-Up Online Ads'' (Business Day, Jan. 19):
Television has been ruined by advertising. Now it's the Internet's turn. Pop-ups are pretty bad, but they can be blocked. Other ads, cunningly designed to use motion or flashing lights to capture attention, must be endured.
But the Internet (and television) cannot exist without advertising. And advertising fills a real need in informing the public about the availability of worthy goods and services. What to do?
Why not have a ''classified'' section like the newspapers? This could easily be done by requiring advertisers to use the same last three letters, say ''.ads,'' in their URL.
A properly designed ''classified'' section would lure browsers and clean up the Internet.
