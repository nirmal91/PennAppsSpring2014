The airline KLM Royal Dutch said that its cost-cutting program helped it post a profit of 8 million euros ($10 million) in its most recent quarter, reversing a loss of 66 million euros in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the third quarter of KLM's fiscal year, fell 7 percent, to 1.46 billion euros. The carrier expects to break even in the current fiscal year.
