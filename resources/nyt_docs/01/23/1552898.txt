WHILE millions flood Florida's theme parks and southern beaches in winter, a shrewd few head instead to the central Panhandle. Sure, the sun isn't quite as warming, but tupelo honey runs pure in national forests, rivers flow along moss-threaded cypress stands, and Apalachicola Bay -- one of the planet's richest -- lavishes diners with choice seafood. The ideal base camp is the town of Apalachicola, 75 miles southwest of Tallahassee. It has long been famous for its oysters and lately for its demeanor: a historic fisherman's haven with stylish inns and galleries but solid Old South roots. Known locally as Apalach, it was founded by 19th-century sponge divers and cotton and lumber barons. Their restored Georgian and Victorian manses and cottages idle along the bay, and their descendants work hard hauling shrimp, fish, crabs and oysters. Meanwhile, newcomers trickle in (the population is barely 3,000), opening fashionable boutiques, cafes and antiques stores in former cotton warehouses. Minutes from Apalach, the white sands of the barrier-island beaches are so smooth and quiet, locals guarantee that ''you can hear the fiddler crabs shuffle by.''

5:30 p.m.  1. Dinner on the Ochlockonee  On the way to Apalach, flash back to 1960's Florida at Angelo's (5 Mashers Sand Road, 850-984-5168) in Panacea. For decades, Angelo Petrandis has been catching fish in the Gulf of Mexico, then cooking them at his rambling restaurant on the Ochlockonee River. The presentation is straightforward (classic oval platters, sauces in squeeze bottles) and so is the food, from the charbroiled octopus appetizer to seafood cakes fattened with Panacea's famous hand-picked blue crabmeat. Ask for a table by the windows and watch the river glow as the sun sets. If there is no waterside table (Angelo's doesn't take reservations), order a beer and wait for one on the wraparound porch. After dinner, keep winding west 45 miles to Apalachicola, guided by the star-lit bay much of the way.
Saturday
9 a.m.  2. Oystercakes and Pancakes  A faded sign at Caroline's (123 Water Street; 850-653-8139) promises ''Seafood and Serenity'' -- and it doesn't get any better than at breakfast time. Order your eggs with oystercakes or with spicy shrimp creole over buttermilk biscuits ($10.95 to $11.95). For the sweet tooth, there are puffy pecan pancakes ($5.50). Through the cedar-framed windows, you can watch shrimp boats returning from their nightly run, slipping up the frothy blue Apalachicola River.
10 a.m.  3. Around Apalach Town  From Caroline's, explore the nine-square-block ''downtown,'' a blend of 1800's brick and tin warehouses, 1900's cottages and sloping docks where fishermen unload crates of oysters and shrimp. Across from the docks, the Grady Market (76 Water Street, 850-653-4099) is a 19th-century ship's chandlery made over into galleries and boutiques. A block down, shop for ship finds at the Tin Shed (170 Water Street, 850-653-3635), which specializes in antique nautical items like Japanese fishing floats. The inventory at Oystercatcher (118 Commerce Street, 850-653-1616) runs to ruched velvet and suede skirts, sequined sandals, and mod oil paintings by the artist-owners from Alaska, while inside the perfumed, glittering recesses of Riverlily (78 Commerce Street, 850-653-2600), shoppers have been known to mislay the better part of a day going through the gowns, wraps, jewelry and body and bath potions.
12:30 p.m.  4. Half-Shelling  Head west out of Apalach to the Indian Pass Raw Bar (8391 County Road C-30A, Indian Pass; 850-227-1670). The cobwebbed, faded-shack exterior may look like an abandoned gas station, but the place hums with diners all day and into the early evening. The highlight: the man shucking oysters at the end of the bar and sliding them down to eager patrons on vinyl stools. There are a few sandwiches on the menu as well as Key lime pie ($2.50), but oysters are the thing. Order them baked with garlic butter and parmesan cheese ($6.95 a dozen). Help yourself to a drink or ice cream from the cooler.
2 p.m.  5. An Island or a Cape  Five minutes from the raw bar, at the east end of Indian Pass, lies an easy way to a secret island. Rent a kayak (Happy Ours Kayak and Canoe Outpost, 850-229-1991, or Entrance outfitters, 850-227-7529) for the half-hour paddle to St. Vincent Island. This national wildlife refuge, accessible only by boat, has white-beach coves with curvaceous palms and hardwood forests roamed by sambar deer. For those who prefer dry land, there's Cape San Blas, just west of Indian Pass, with its startlingly beautiful -- and empty -- beaches. The best place to stroll or park a towel is at St. Joseph Peninsula State Park (850-227-1327), above, where the dunes glitter like snow banks.
5:30 p.m.  6. Sunset on the Bay  With its green lawns, brick pathways and tall elegant gazebo, Lafayette Park (Avenue B and 14th Street, Apalachicola) is inherently serene. Go at sunset, when a few fishermen and women gather at the end of the park's long pier, casting for snapper and flounder in Apalachicola Bay. Pick a spot on the pier, dangle your legs over the water and watch the setting sun turn the bay scarlet.
6:30 p.m.  7. An Evening Roost  From Lafayette, stroll along Bay Avenue toward town, past Federal-style and Queen Anne houses with blossoming gardens. Right in town, the Owl Café (15 Avenue D; 850-653-9888) is where locals roost once the sun goes down. It's a snug corner nest with Brazilian cherrywood floors and a dozen tables -- so few that reservations are a must -- set with crisp linen, butcher paper and oil lamps. The waitresses, winsome in their pencil-legged Tahari pants, might suggest the black grouper sautéed with artichoke hearts and roasted garlic and capers in white wine lemon sauce ($18.95) or a special like seared yellowfin tuna with South Carolina barbecue sauce and cornmeal-crusted oysters ($24). But first, order the rosy blue-crab dip served with flash-fried tortilla chips ($7.50).
8:30 p.m.  8. A Port, and a Storm  When Verandas (76 Market Street; 850-653-3210), Apalach's first wine bar, opened five months ago, some residents were aghast, fearing its stylish city ways -- a vibrant, loft-like space with hammered copper bar -- would snuff out the fishing town's scruffy character. So far it's been nothing but a hit, especially after dinner, when diners can enjoy a glass of tawny port ($5) and warm, custardy raspberry bread pudding ($6) in an intimate, second-floor nook.
Sunday
9:30 a.m.  9. St. George Island  Cross the bridge heading east toward Tallahassee and turn right at Eastpoint onto the causeway out to St. George Island, which drifts between Apalachicola Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Skip the developed mid-island and stick to the northeast end, where St. George Island State Park (850-927-2111) protects nine miles of broad beach. The dunes are high and sculptural, and the surf is calm enough for swimming. After beachcombing, explore the nature trails through pine flatwood forest.
Noon  10. That Place On 98  Lunch awaits on the mainland where oyster shucking houses squat along the bay. In the heart of the shucking scene, That Place on 98 (500 Highway 98, Eastpoint; 850-670-9898) serves the bivalves on the half shell ($5.98 a dozen), in a creamy stew ($4.98 a cup), or fried ($9.98 a dozen). Sit right on the bay (two tin-topped decks were recently expanded) and gaze across glittering mountains of oyster shells. Take the short route back to Tallahassee, picking up Route 319 northeast of Lanark, and watch for farmstands selling tupelo honey near tranquil Sopchoppy.
THE BASICS  Visiting Apalachicola
Apalachicola is 75 miles from Tallahassee Regional Airport, which is served by major carriers including Delta, United and Northwest. You'll need to rent a car. To reach Apalachicola, drive southwest on Route 319 to Route 98.
The Coombs House Inn (80 6th Street, 850-653-9199), above, was built in 1905 by a lumber magnate and meticulously renovated in the 1990's by a Miami designer. Black cedar and tiger oak gleam in the foyer of the two-story Victorian. Its 19 guest rooms -- some of them in other nearby houses -- are $109 to $250. A full breakfast is included.
On the second floor of the Grady Market, Consulate Suites (76 Water Street; 877-239-1159) offers four apartment-size suites with features like 11-foot tin ceilings, exposed brick walls, burled walnut beds and marble-topped dressers. Three suites have views of the river; all have balconies. Rates are $175 to $290 a night.
