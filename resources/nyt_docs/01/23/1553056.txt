Already looking past New Hampshire, Senator John Kerry picked up an endorsement on Thursday from Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, one of seven states with primaries on Feb. 3.
''We got a fellow who's fiscally responsible, who's experienced, who's good in foreign policy,'' Mr. Hollings said at a news conference in Columbia, S.C.
''This country's got to wake up,'' he added. ''John Kerry'll wake them up, I can tell you that right now.''
But the iconoclastic senator did not stop there. In the span of a few minutes, as Mr. Kerry repeatedly tried to enter the news conference by telephone from New Hampshire, the typically razor-edged Mr. Hollings proceeded to dismiss the value of his own endorsement.
He had critical words for one of Mr. Kerry's rivals, too: Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a South Carolina native. ''He and I are good trial lawyers together,'' Mr. Hollings said, ''but he doesn't have near the experience and can go all the way and really take it and get that White House away from Bush.''
Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for Mr. Edwards, responded by saying: ''Senator Edwards has a great deal of respect for Senator Hollings. Now the voters of South Carolina will decide whom to support.''
Mr. Hollings, 82, who is retiring after this year, said his support was worth ''very little'' by itself. ''I don't have an organization,'' he said. ''And I'm not kidding myself.''
But Mr. Kerry, when finally able to be heard, seemed ready to make up for that. ''I intend to come down there with a head of steam,'' he said.
Mr. Hollings said it was important for Mr. Kerry to make a strong showing in South Carolina, if only to put to rest the notion that a ''Massachusetts liberal'' cannot carry states in the South.
