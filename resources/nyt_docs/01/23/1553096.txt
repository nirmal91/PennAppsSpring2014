An audit by the city comptroller accuses the Parks and Recreation Department of failing to ensure that its concessionaires complete required improvements to their businesses. The audit, presented to the Parks Department in June but released yesterday, found that capital improvements worth $10 million were not completed at 37 of the 58 concessionaires visited by investigators. Megan Sheekey, a spokeswoman for the Parks Department, called the audit wildly inaccurate and said the businesses met or exceeded the improvements required by their contracts. The department supervises 600 concessions, including ice rinks, golf courses, restaurants, stables and marinas, in city parks.
