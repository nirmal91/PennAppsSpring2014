A recent appearance at the Yankees' fantasy camp has brought Tommy John back to the organization. John, who earned 91 of his 288 career victories with the Yankees, is returning to the team as the manager of the Class A Staten Island Yankees.
John spent the last two seasons as a pitching coach in the Montreal organization, and he was scheduled to work for the Expos again next season. Then he saw the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, at the fantasy camp. ''He said: 'I always knew you'd be a good teacher. We have to get you over here,' '' John said.
Steinbrenner soon offered John the Staten Island job, and John took it despite having a job at a higher minor league affiliate, Class AAA Edmonton, in the Expos' system. John has managed in the Arizona Fall League and wants to return to the majors. ''To get where I want to go, which is a big-league team, this is better,'' John said. ''It gets me back into New York.''
