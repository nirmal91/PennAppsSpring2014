A former Camden County man already serving 10 years in prison for stealing Sept. 11 survivor benefits by submitting two claims that his ''wife'' was killed in the World Trade Center attack pleaded guilty yesterday in State Superior Court to insurance and credit card fraud, prosecutors said. The man, Mark Christopher, 39, admitted that he had staged at least eight automobile accidents in New Jersey from 1997 to 2001 and had filed bogus claims totaling more than $21,000 using fictitious names, including Kim Christopher and Lisa Palmerri, the same names he used for his nonexistent wives to steal more than $70,000 in Sept. 11 aid. Mr. Christopher faces another 10 years in prison at his sentencing, set for March 19.
