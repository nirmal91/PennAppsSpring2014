Cable and Wireless of Britain said last night that it would sell its American units to the Savvis Communications Corporation for $155 million in cash, plus the assumption of $12.4 million in debt.
Savvis was the winning bidder in a private auction for the United States operations, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.
The price tops the $125 million bid in a sale announced last month by the Gores Technology Group, an investment fund in Los Angeles, and Cable and Wireless. The names of the five other bidders were not disclosed.
Savvis, based in St. Louis, said that the strength of the American unit of Cable and Wireless was in providing Internet access and Web sites to corporations. Savvis has focused on building internal networks and managing companies' computers.
Robert A. McCormick, Savvis's chief executive, said the company would have revenue of about $700 million. The sale is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court in Phoenix and federal regulators.
