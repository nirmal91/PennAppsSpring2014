To the Editor:
Re ''A Single Conscience v. the State,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 19):
By leaking a highly classified memo to the press, Katharine Gun surely violated the terms of her employment by Britain's top-secret Government Communications Headquarters. Such a violation of trust makes her unemployable by any agency that requires secrecy.
While if convicted, she faces up to two years in prison, that pales in comparison with the likely penalty of leaking secrets -- murder, torture, the murder of your family -- under the regime recently deposed by George W. Bush and Tony Blair.
That ''Ms. Gun felt passionately that an invasion of Iraq was wrong'' is appealed to as mitigating the leak, as if passionate feelings adhered to some kind of moral standard. Need we be reminded that ''passionate feelings'' underlie all kinds of reprehensible and criminal behavior, from domestic violence to suicide bombing?
Is passion really so far above duty and commitment?
