Nortel Networks of Canada said yesterday that it would dispose of its remaining manufacturing operations to focus on installing and maintaining telecommunications networks. Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, and Flextronics of Singapore said they were in talks with a view to Flextronics' taking over the businesses in Canada, Brazil, Northern Ireland and France. The operations have about 2,500 employees and annual revenues of over $2 billion. Flextronics would pay about $500 million in cash over nine months, plus an additional amount for intangible assets.
