Las Vegas
WHEN  Feb. 1
WHY
Last year, the Super Bowl in San Diego drew more than 250,000 people -- to Las Vegas, and the crowds this year are again expected to exceed those in Houston, the site of the Panthers-Patriots matchup. The main draw, of course, is legal betting on the game. The sportsbooks, as the betting parlors are called, from the famous one at the Stardust on down, will be packed. Some bettors have even been known to camp out overnight for a seat. More accessible are the numerous casino parties, usually involving some combination of free beer, food, giant television screens and, in some cases, scantily clad models and cash prizes. The bashes include Bally's Super Party ($75, 800-237-7469); the MGM Grand Buffet party ($67, 877-880-0880); all-you-can-eat food and drink at Mandalay Bay ($70, 702-632-7580); the Aladdin's Super Sunday ($26.25, 702-785-5000) with Hawaiian Tropic girls and a chance to win $100,000; and at Orleans Arena ($65 reserved, $45 general, 702-284-7777), prizes as high as $500,000 and a postgame Blue Oyster Cult concert. Most of the big hotels on the Strip, like New York New York, the Bellagio and the Paris, are booked (or, like the Venetian, have only $750-plus rooms left), but a few options in nearby downtown are still available.
