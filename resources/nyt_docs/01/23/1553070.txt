Hudson Clearing  250 Hudson Street, at Broome Street  South Village  Through Feb. 8
Occupying a capacious, temporarily vacant commercial space near the entrance to the New York end of the Holland Tunnel, the intermittently exciting ''Sprawl'' presents nine emerging artists whose works reflect ideas about proliferation and expansion. The exhibition was organized by the independent curators Haan Y. Chau and Emily Wei.
One of this show's two most impressive works is by Chris Hanson and Hendrika Sonnenberg: a green polystyrene foam sculpture representing in extraordinary detail an actual-size hockey scoreboard that appears to have fallen from the ceiling and broken on the floor. The other is a ramshackle installation by Eve Sussman consisting of a 20-foot-tall steel tower bearing four film projectors that collectively project grainy, semiabstract imagery shot while riding up and down in a glass elevator in the interior courtyard of a high-rise hotel.
Justin Beal's eight-foot-wide digitally composed photograph, depicting deep-sea oil-drilling platforms whose structural elements have fantastically multiplied, is absorbing to study. Less so is a confusing quasi-scientific project by a group called Spurse, in which blue-taped grids, indecipherable flow charts, collections of bagged and tagged found objects and much more are spread across floors and walls.
Efforts by the other artists -- including the sculptors Jimbo Blachly, Liam Everett, Oscar Tuazon and Eric Brown, and the painter Lisa Sigal -- tend to get lost in the raw and vast exhibition space. Featuring mostly humble materials and processes, their works might look good in conventional galleries but to flourish here they would need to be more aggressive or concentrated.
