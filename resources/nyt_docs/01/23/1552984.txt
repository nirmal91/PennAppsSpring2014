To the Editor:
In ''The Big Test for the Contenders'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 21), David Frum and Richard Perle assert that ''the United Nations is more likely to restrain us than help us in our war against terrorism.'' That is not true.
When the horror of 9/11 hit the United States, the Security Council passed two vital resolutions that provided the international legal framework for the fight against terrorism.
Resolution 1373 required countries to interdict arms flows, freeze financial transfers to suspected terror groups, report on the movements of terrorists and update national antiterror legislation.
Without the legal authority of such a resolution -- binding on all United Nations members -- the United States would have been hard pressed to obtain such cooperation ''retail'' from 191 individual countries. And it would have taken decades to negotiate and ratify treaties and conventions imposing the same prohibitions.
The United Nations has proved to be indispensable in the global war against terror.
