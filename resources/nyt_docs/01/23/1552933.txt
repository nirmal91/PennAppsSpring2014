To the Editor:
With the Republicans controlling all three branches of government and a president who defines commander in chief as the one who can do whatever he desires on his say-so, Americans need the Supreme Court as never before for balance.
Anthony Lewis (''The Justices Take On the President,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 16) defends each of us when he questions the president's power to declare any American citizen an ''enemy combatant.''
Muzzling justice is a failure of justice.
