In the latest sign of consolidation in the banking industry, the Regions Financial Corporation of Birmingham, Ala., is in talks to buy the Union Planters Corporation of Memphis for about $6 billion in stock, people close to the discussions said last night. The deal, which could be announced as early as today, would create a bank with about $81 billion in assets and branches concentrated mostly in the Southeast and Midwest. While much smaller in scope, it would follow two other recent bank transactions: the combination of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One for $58 billion and the merger of Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial for about $48 billion.
