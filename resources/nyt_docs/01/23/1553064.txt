The anatomist Gunther von Hagens, whose human corpse exhibition ''Body Worlds'' has evoked fascination and disgust, said he could not rule out having used bodies of executed Chinese prisoners for his displays. ''My orders have always been clear: no one who was sentenced to death, but I wouldn't put my hand in the fire for it and say we weren't perhaps given one or the other execution victim,'' Dr. von Hagens said in Frankfurt. He was responding to a report in the magazine Der Spiegel that said his company in China had procured corpses from prisons, including one for political prisoners. Among the bodies in the inventory, the magazine said, were at least two with bullet holes in the heads. Dr. von Hagens's exhibitions display bodies posed in activities like running, sitting or sleeping. The corpses are opened to show internal organs, muscles and bones. Since 1996, the show has attracted more than 13 million visitors around the world.
