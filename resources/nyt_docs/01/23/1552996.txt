Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello said Thursday that defenseman Scott Stevens would return to action when he was ready and that Stevens would decide when that is.
''We're going to totally put it in his hands,'' Lamoriello said.
Stevens, 39, has missed the last seven games because of what he said Saturday might be postconcussion syndrome. He was placed on injured reserve Tuesday and is out indefinitely.
Lamoriello did not want to predict Thursday when Stevens would be back or say if a timetable had been established. Asked if he thought Stevens would be able to return this season, Lamoriello said, ''I'm very confident he will be back.''
Lamoriello also said right wing Jamie Langenbrunner had resumed skating and had said that his surgically repaired knee was not bothering him. ''We don't want that strain to go anywhere else,'' Lamoriello said.
Meanwhile, Igor Larionov, scratched from Wednesday's loss to Carolina, said he had talked to Coach Pat Burns on Wednesday and Thursday and was able to discuss some of the differences that apparently existed between them.
He expects to play Friday against Montreal and hopes to help a Devils power-play unit that is struggling. Larionov has not scored a goal this season, and the Devils have scored only one goal on their last 20 power plays.
