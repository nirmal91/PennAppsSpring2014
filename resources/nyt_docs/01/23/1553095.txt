A lawsuit against the City Health Department, protesting its practice of posting health violations against restaurants on the city's Web site, was dismissed last week by Magistrate Robert M. Levy of Federal District Court here. The challenge was brought by the New York State Restaurant Association and 44 individual restaurants, which charged that providing public information about inspections, as well as the department's new guidelines for citing and classifying violations, were illegal and unfair. The court said the city had a legitimate public health purpose.
