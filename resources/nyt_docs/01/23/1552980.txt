To the Editor:
Does ''Big Test for the Contenders,'' by David Frum and Richard Perle (Op-Ed, Jan. 21), confuse rhetoric with reality?
Democrats, like all Americans, support rooting out and destroying terrorists and their supporters. But no links between terrorists and Saddam Hussein have been found. Huge stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction do not exist.
Americans deserve a leader who will deal with issues of national security with both strength and honesty. The current administration seems to think that tough talk trumps all other concerns. This should not be acceptable.
