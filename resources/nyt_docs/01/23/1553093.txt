A State Supreme Court jury found an East Harlem man, William Hernandez, 23, guilty yesterday of raping a 15-year-old girl and throwing her from the roof of a 14-story apartment building. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Justice Bonnie G. Wittner on Feb. 17 and faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said. Mr. Hernandez was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder, and of first- and third-degree rape. Mr. Hernandez was arrested in September 2002, just days after the murder of the teenager, Sheinna Morales, at the George Washington Houses on East 97th Street.
