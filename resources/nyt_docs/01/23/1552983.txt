To the Editor:
In ''The Big Test for the Contenders'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 21), David Frum and Richard Perle say ''taking the war to the enemy'' is the solution to terrorism.
Imagine if Israel did this with every Middle Eastern country that supported terrorism. Then imagine how we could sustain such a strategy when Syria, Iran, North Korea and several other countries are supporting terrorism or building weapons of mass destruction. Our military is already stretched too thin.
