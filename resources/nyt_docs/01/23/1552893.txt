WHO -- Mark Regan, 41, a golf course and liquor store owner, and his wife, Debbie, 35  WHAT -- 10-by-20-foot ice-fishing house at Twin Pines Resort on Mille Lacs Lake  WHERE -- Garrison, Minn.
Mark: My neighbor Steve Holmes and his dad had bought a cabin up on Mille Lacs and me and Steve traveled up there to go ice fishing when we were young. We'd turn on the heater Friday night and sit out there till Sunday. This house weighs 6,500 pounds. You need a foot to 15 inches of ice to put it out. Mille Lacs Lake is the premier walleye lake in Minnesota; it's 132,000 acres.
Debbie: My family's from Milaca, right by Mille Lacs Lake. We spent all our time fishing, too, so it kind of worked out good hooking up with this guy. We actually were engaged in this fish house. He took me out and got down on one knee.
Mark: I was going to hook the ring to a line and drop it down the hole and have her pull it up, but I didn't quite dare to. If it didn't come up I would be in trouble.
Debbie: There are actually towns of fish houses. I don't know if you've ever seen ''Grumpy Old Men,'' but it's exactly like that. You get to know everybody around you. You check and see what's biting, what's not. You wear your earflap hat and flannel.
Mark: Normally we go up every weekend and sleep in the fish house. If for some reason they're not biting or Deb's cold and ornery I'll take her back to our cabin in Aitkin.
Debbie: He's got the manly story going now. I'm pregnant with our first child and I need to go to shore sometimes. But I'm still fishing.
