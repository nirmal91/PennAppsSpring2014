The investigation tracking cattle from the Canadian herd of the first cow in the United States with mad cow disease has expanded outside Washington State. Agriculture officials said that a cow from the herd had been found at a dairy in Boardman, near the Washington border. The officials said the cow had not been imported with the infected cow but had been part of a later shipment.
