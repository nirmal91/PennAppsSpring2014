Brent Sikkema Gallery  530 West 22nd Street  Chelsea  Through Feb. 21
Marlene McCarty's large, expert pencil and ballpoint pen drawings of beautiful adolescents lolling about are glamorous and, with nipples and genitalia sometimes surreally visible, seductive. You might assume that they comment on advertising's exploitation of the nascent sexuality of young models.
If so, a lengthy wall label will set you straight.
The figures and poses may come from fashion magazines, but the faces are those of a California girl named Marlene Olive; her parents, Jim and Naomi, whom she killed on June 21, 1975; and Chuck, the tousle-headed boyfriend who helped her. This is a big problem because, in effect, the most sensational aspect of the drawings lies beyond their borders.
The text prompts us to read malevolence into Marlene's sometimes deadened gaze, and tragic loss into a double image of Marlene and Naomi as they looked in 1975, and into an earlier one when a beautiful Naomi dandled her baby daughter.
The most autonomous image shows Marlene and Chuck lolling beside her father; its subtle lasciviousness stems from the way Jim's arms and hands encircle them. But this has nothing to do with the fact that Jim adored his daughter and was murdered simply because he arrived home unexpectedly.
In the early 1990's Ms. McCarty encrypted her interest in language, sex, adolescence and intimations of violence into calligraphic renderings of profanities (mostly pertaining to women) that were strident and also irreducible. Now she is adding to the flood of fashion-illustration/high school notebook renderings of steamy adolescents that can mean just about anything, while joining the bandwagon of the newer, more glamorous political correctness.
But mainly she has pulled apart the elements of her art, separating language from meaning and from image. In time, she may figure out how to put everything back together again.
