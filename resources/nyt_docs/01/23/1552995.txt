To the Editor:
In ''A Judicial End Run'' (editorial, Jan. 17), you complain, quoting Senator Charles E. Schumer, that the recess appointment of Charles W. Pickering Sr. was a ''a finger in the eye'' for all those seeking fairness in the nomination process.
As a Republican, I would agree. But the Democratic filibuster was also.
