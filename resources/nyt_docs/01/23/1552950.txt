Two American soldiers were killed and one was wounded Wednesday in a mortar attack on a base north of this city, the American military said.
Over the past two days in two separate attacks in Falluja, insurgents attacked Iraqis cooperating with the occupation forces, killing Iraqi policemen and cleaning women who worked for American troops.
Guerrillas fired rockets and mortars at an American military base in Baquba on Wednesday evening, killing two soldiers with the Fourth Infantry Division and critically wounding a third.
The assault on the military base was the third attack in two weeks in Baquba; the earlier two were against Iraqis. Two weeks ago, a suicide bomber killed four other people outside a mosque, and last week a bomb exploded outside a police station and killed two police officers.
Also on Wednesday, insurgents fired on a bus in Falluja that was carrying home Iraqi women who worked at an American military base in Habbaniya. The ambush killed four women and wounded six others, all of whom worked at the base, Reuters reported.
On Thursday, insurgents drove by and attacked police officers at a checkpoint with automatic rifles and a grenade, killing two officers and a civilian.
