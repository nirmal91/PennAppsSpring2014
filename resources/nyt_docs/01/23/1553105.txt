An article in The Arts on Monday about ''Cause Celeb!'' a weekly series in Manhattan in which performers read from celebrities' autobiographies, referred incorrectly to its origin. The series began a little more than a year ago in New York, not seven years ago in Los Angeles. (Its creators, Nancy Balbirer and Charlotte Booker, were then in a show there created by Eugene Pack called ''In Their Own Words: Celebrity Autobiographies.'')
The article also misstated the relationship between Esther Williams, whose autobiography was a subject this month, and Jeff Chandler, who was in the passage that was read. They were companions, not a married couple.
