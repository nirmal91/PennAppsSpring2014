To the Editor:
Re ''A Single Conscience v. the State,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 19):
The real scandal is not that Katharine Gun, a translator at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, leaked a United States National Security Agency memo outlining an American plan to spy on foreign United Nations delegations, a plan whose purpose was to gain ''information that could give U.S. policymakers an edge in obtaining results favorable to U.S. goals'' of gaining support for an invasion of Iraq.
Nor is it even that Ms. Gun is being prosecuted by the British government for her actions.
The big scandal here is that this story of the United States government's willingness to take whatever steps -- legal or illegal, moral or immoral, truthful or deceitful -- to justify its predetermined desire to invade Iraq has not been more fully reported by an American news media cowed by this administration's tendency to question the patriotism of all who dare oppose its policies.
Shame on the news media for abdicating their responsibility to use their constitutionally protected status to inform the public.
