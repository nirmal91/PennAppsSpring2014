To the Editor:
Re ''Riding the Crazy Train,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 22); and ''Dean: Too Old to Cry,'' by William Safire (column, Jan. 21):
While Howard Dean probably wishes that his presentation style had been altered a bit, the media are blowing his post-Iowa caucus speech far out of proportion.
The event is being mischaracterized as anger when it was actually an enthusiastic rallying cry for a loud, cheering group of supporters.
If you will notice, Dr. Dean was laughing and smiling!
To suggest that this somehow makes him unqualified to be president is ludicrous.
Dr. Dean's character, courage, strong record of achievement and pragmatism have drawn large numbers of ordinary Americans to his candidacy.
Many of us would be honored to have him as our president.
