Glenn Myernick, the coach of the United States Olympic team, yesterday named his 22-man roster for qualifying matches, a list that included MetroStars midfielder Eddie Gaven.
At 17 years 89 days, Gaven, who is from Hamilton, N.J., and was drafted by the MetroStars last year, becomes the youngest player to appear on a United States Olympic qualifying team. Gaven was also on the United States team that played in the under-17 world championships last summer in Finland. The United States is among eight nations that will be playing for two berths in this summer's Athens Games. The team begins qualifying matches on Feb. 3, playing Panama in Guadalajara, Mexico. The match will be followed by games against Canada (Feb. 4) and Honduras (Feb. 7).
Myernick's roster also includes defender Chris Wingert, the former St. John's standout and the Hermann Trophy winner, who is from Babylon, N.Y.; striker Alecko Eskandarian, who is from Montvale, N.J.; and striker Edson Buddle, who plays for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer and is a native of New Rochelle, N.Y.
