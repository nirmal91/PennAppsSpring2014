To the Editor:
Reading ''As Consumers Revolt, a Rush to Block Pop-Up Online Ads'' (Business Day, Jan. 19), I thought that I must have been looking at an old newspaper. I have not seen a pop-up ad in several years, since a pop-up blocker has been part of Netscape's browser for quite some time. I wonder what took Microsoft so long to address one of the most annoying aspects of the Internet experience.
