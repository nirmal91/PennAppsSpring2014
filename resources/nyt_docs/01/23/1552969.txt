Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about vacations that incorporate a measure of self-denial misattributed a quotation about the Lucky Dog Lodge in New Hampshire. It was Andrea Blanch, not her traveling companion, Gabby Tana, who said: ''I will always like four-star luxe living. It was challenging for me to rough it and not speak for periods of time, but the results made up for it. I left with such an amazing feeling that, although I complained about little things, like hearing other people go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I returned refreshed. It was freeing. So what if it meant having to make my own bed?''
