A military tribunal convicted Theodore Dago Sery, a 28-year-old police officer, of the murder of a French journalist in Abidjan in October, and sentenced him to 17 years in prison. The verdict came a year after a peace accord, mediated by France and intended to end the country's civil war, unleashed violent protests against French citizens and businesses in Abidjan, the largest city. The journalist, Jean Hélène, 50, a longtime reporter for Radio France Internationale, was shot outside a police station.
