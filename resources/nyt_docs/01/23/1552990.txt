To the Editor:
Re ''Riding the Crazy Train'' (column, Jan. 22):
Maureen Dowd's mocking comments about Howard Dean's exuberant cheerleading performance after the Iowa caucus results are off the mark. Just as Vince Lombardi roused his team at halftime, so Dr. Dean wanted to lift the spirits of his hard-working ''team'' in the face of a dispiriting third-place finish.
Those who would punish Dr. Dean for showing some energy would not condemn a good preacher for rousing the congregation with similar enthusiasm.
Since 9/11, our politicians have returned to the fear-driven McCarthy days, when ''don't make waves'' was the phrase to survive by.
The word ''enthusiasm'' is rooted in the notion of ''a god within'' -- the real human spirit that drives the best in us. Rather than belittle courageous verve, we might urge our political leaders to show more honest emotion, not less.
Once more, with feeling, Dr. Dean.
