To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd rightly links Howard Dean's overheated speech after the Iowa caucuses and George W. Bush's ''swaggering sheriff'' State of the Union address (column, Jan. 22). I'd like to add that both of those hotheaded performances serve to highlight what used to be considered Senator John Kerry's weakness: his calm, thoughtful, statesmanlike demeanor.
As a genuine war hero, John Kerry does not need to rant and stomp and play ''dress-up'' in a flight suit.
Speaking as a woman voter weary of such swagger and shout, I find John Kerry's hard-earned soldier's dignity looking awfully good just about now.
