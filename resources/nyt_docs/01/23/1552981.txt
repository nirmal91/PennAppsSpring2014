To the Editor:
David Frum and Richard Perle wonder if any of the Democratic candidates would take ''the war against terrorism to the terrorists'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 21). Yet they do not point out a big mistake of the Bush regime in its war on terror -- its insistence on taking the war on terror to Iraq.
To its credit, the Bush administration realized quickly that 9/11 changed everything . . . or almost everything.
It is now clear that the administration was undeterred by 9/11, particularly in its determination to invade Iraq. It held to its view despite the fact that such an action, far from aiding the war on terror, would, when carried out unilaterally, undermine that fight by alienating allies, aiding the recruitment of new terrorists and diverting resources from the real terror battle occurring on the ground in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
