The Russian government arrested the chairman of a Yukos refinery, putting more pressure on the oil company. A regional court ordered that the executive, Rafail Zainullin, be detained for two months on charges that the plant evaded taxes in 1999, when he served as general director of the Kuibyshev plant in the Volga Samara region. Mr. Zainullin retired as general director of the refinery in 2002, but remained chairman. The arrest expands Russian prosecutors' investigations into the former Yukos chief executive Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who remains in jail awaiting trial, and other leading Yukos shareholders.
