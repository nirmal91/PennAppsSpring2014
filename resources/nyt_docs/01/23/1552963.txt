The University of Pennsylvania yesterday named Amy Gutmann, the provost of Princeton, to be its next president.
Dr. Gutmann, 54, will succeed Judith Rodin, who became the first woman to head an Ivy League institution, then led the university through a decade of significant growth in its endowment, research funding, applicant pool and selectivity. (In 1994, Dr. Rodin succeeded Claire Fagin, who had been interim president.)
''Clearly, Penn is counting on me being a quick study,'' said Dr. Gutmann, who will begin in July. ''The most important aspect of my decision to come to Penn is a total confidence that the aims of this institution are totally in line with my own values.''
Dr. Gutmann has long been regarded as an advocate for diversity in higher education, and she emphasized that she wanted to continue Penn's investments in the neighborhoods that surround the university in Philadelphia. She said that she wanted to foster an atmosphere on campus that encouraged dialogue on ''the toughest issues of our time.''
James S. Riepe, chairman of Penn's trustees, described Dr. Gutmann as a ''brilliant scholar'' who was ''the ideal person'' to build on the momentum Dr. Rodin established.
