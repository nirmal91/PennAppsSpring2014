New marble sculptures by Marc Quinn, the British artist best known for casting a sculptural self-portrait in frozen blood, are so calculatingly provocative that it is impossible not to feel annoyed by them. Each is a life-size nude portrait of a real person who by birth or by accident has missing or deformed limbs.
Carved in white stone by Italian artisans using body casts as references, the sculptures have a generalized, anonymous look of classical antiquity. This brings into play a number of obvious ideas: the tension between traditional notions of the heroic and the more ordinary kinds of heroism; the clash between ideal standards of human beauty and actual people who are found less than beautiful by those standards.
There is also the play with fragmentation: instead of broken antique sculptures of ideal beings, we have unbroken sculptures of human bodies that are, in one sense, broken.
But whatever meanings, deep or trite, may be read into these works, the whole project comes off as a sensationalistic stunt. Some might read it as a celebration of human diversity, but the sculptures have such a kitschy blandness that it is hard to see them as anything other than ready-mades in a Koonsian game intended to make us think more about the artist's intellectual cleverness than the humanity of his subjects.
