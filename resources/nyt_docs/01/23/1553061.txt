There was a sharp rise in the number of known counterfeits of euro coins in the European Union last year, the currency's second year in existence, the European Commission said. The number of fake 50 cent, 1 euro and 2 euro coins detected by national central banks rose to 26,191, up from just 2,339 in their first year in circulation. But the total number of counterfeit euro coins found in circulation was still much lower than the number of counterfeit coins of the 12 national currencies that were replaced by the euro in January 2002.
