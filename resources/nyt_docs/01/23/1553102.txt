An article in Business Day on Jan. 3 about a lawsuit filed by International Air Leases Inc., an aircraft leasing company, against a law firm and bank that it says sold it an abusive tax shelter, misstated the law office that issued a legal opinion calling the shelter legitimate. It was the New York office of Brown &amp; Wood, not its Chicago office. (Brown &amp; Wood later merged with another firm, Sidley &amp; Austin; the combined firm is named as a defendant in the suit.)
