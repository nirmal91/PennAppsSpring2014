Pajaros (Spanish for birds) have captured the lens of the Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide, a one-time student of her compatriot the formidable Manuel Álvarez Bravo. Having won acclaim with pictures steeped in folk and national character, like the matriarchal women of Juchitán, Mexican exile gangs in San Francisco, everyday life in Mexican villages and the landscape of the American South, Ms. Iturbide now shows a lighter side: her pleasure in avian flockings and frolickings.
In photographs from 1980 to now, birds -- in this case, pigeons -- besiege a bull in Jaipur, India; seem to make conversation with monkeys in Amber, also in India; swarm like clouds of nebulae in the skies over Guanajuato, Mexico; and wheel amiably over the head of a ''bird man'' in Nayarit, a state in Mexico.
Sometimes, too, they are spotted apart from the flock. In one particularly striking image, made in India, a pair of hawklike predators hover over ''lost'' dogs silhouetted against the sky on a mountain ridge.
In another, a crow flies at a safe distance past a literal ''scarecrow,'' a jacket that hangs menacingly on a tree branch.
And in a third, a sort of still life, a hen nestles compatibly on the arm of a female flower vendor holding a bowl of her wares.
Birds are a photogenic lot; you can't lose taking their pictures. But Ms. Iturbide seems to have a special sense of them that makes her pictures, so to speak, fly.
