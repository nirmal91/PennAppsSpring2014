To the Editor:
The expenditure of $50 million of taxpayer money for an indoor rain forest in Iowa, one of Congress's ''$23 billion of pork-barrel projects'' (editorial, Dec. 27), is a paradox indeed. An administration so intent on leaving expenditures as much as possible to the private sector evidently realizes that few if any serious investors could be convinced to invest in such a project.
Perhaps this is to be a monument in memory of what we are so readily destroying!
