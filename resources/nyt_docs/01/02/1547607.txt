To the Editor:
''Pork Shortage for the Homeless'' (editorial, Dec. 27) shows the dubious priorities of the Bush administration, which favors financing special interests at the expense of the ''growing army'' of the homeless, but overlooks a more chilling reality: some people are transient or homeless for the sole reason that they are poor. Some have children who, upon eviction, will be separated and relocated to foster care or adoption.
Recent federal laws have accelerated this process, even as time on waiting lists for available housing lengthens to almost a year, and subsidies dwindle to nothing. Foster care and adoption are expensive. Costs can far exceed a reasonable rental subsidy or even a modest home purchase.
Where poverty is the only reason for homelessness, doing the math this way suggests a disturbing social agenda to ''save'' children from their parents, or punish parents for being poor. Both are unacceptable in a civilized society.
