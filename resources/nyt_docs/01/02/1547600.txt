TRACK AND FIELD  Road Races Recognized
Road running and road walking performances can be officially classified as world records, the International Association of Athletic Federations confirmed yesterday.
Under new guidelines agreed on at the 44th I.A.A.F. Congress in Paris in August, world records will now be recognized in men's and women's road races from 10 kilometers to 100 kilometers, including the marathon, and 20-kilometer and 50-kilometer race walking.
The I.A.A.F. is the world governing body for track and field. Previously, it recognized world records only for track and field events.
Paula Radcliffe, who set the women's record for the marathon in London last April, in 2 hours 15 minutes 25 seconds, now holds the 10K and the 20K road world records as well. (Reuters)
