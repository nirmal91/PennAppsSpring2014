Over the last three decades the Conceptualist Don Celender has been regularly sending out letters to people of all sorts asking questions related to art. In the gallery he presents the actual pages on which his respondents wrote or typed their answers. Though its novelty wore off long ago, Mr. Celender's enterprise remains intermittently interesting and mildly amusing.
One of the three surveys presented here asks, ''Should art be censored?'' Most of the respondents, including the popular art commentator Sister Wendy Beckett, the free-speech advocate Floyd Abrams, the governor of Kentucky and the mayor of Las Vegas, predictably side against censorship, excepting anything that might harm children. Celia Hansen of the Institute for Yoga and Esoteric Sciences would allow censorship only of art that is ''vulgar, obscene or in bad taste,'' which, if you think about it, covers quite a lot of territory.
Another questionnaire asked prison wardens and prisoners what they would choose to hang in their offices or cells. Van Gogh is a favorite in both groups. The well-known prisoners Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald and Manuel Noriega favor, respectively, ancient Egyptian art and Michelangelo. Movie directors choosing which famous artist they would make a film about picked van Gogh, Goya and Alfred Jarry. David Lynch, who likes Diane Arbus, explained: ''She had depression and or mental problems. I love mental problems.''
