To the Editor:
Not everyone in the United States suffered from minuscule pay raises while working harder and increasing productivity, as cited by Paul Krugman (''Our So-Called Boom,'' column, Dec. 30).
Congress voted itself a 2.2 percent raise in 2003. Raises for members of Congress have totaled some $18,000 in the last four years. Their salaries jumped from $136,673 in 1998 to $154,700 in 2003.
