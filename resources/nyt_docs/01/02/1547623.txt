Ise Cultural Foundation  555 Broadway, near Prince Street  SoHo  Through Jan. 10
In Buddhist numerology, 108 has symbolic meanings, being, among other things, the number of sensual desires that make life simultaneously so pleasurable and so anguishing. It is also the number of objects in this unusual group show, organized by Tsutomu Ikeuchi, the director of RÃ¶ntgenwerke, a gallery in Tokyo.
All of the work adheres to a Japanese concept of tanagokoro, meaning works that can be held in the palm of the hand. And indeed, everything can be in this show devoted to a Miniaturist aesthetic, with objects ranging from antique netsuke, to miniceramics, tea sets, religious shrines, space ships, toys and video installations, of a kind last seen in P.S. 1's memorable ''Buzz Club: News From Japan.''
As the curator notes, Buddhism is about quelling desire; the secular religion of capitalism that fuels Japanese and American life is entirely concerned with stimulating it. As if to illustrate this point, the 108 very holdable, havable objects in the show are individually installed in small acrylic cases -- 108 centimeters square -- placed on the gallery floor. To view fully whatever item catches your acquisitive eye, you must kneel before it and bow, low.
