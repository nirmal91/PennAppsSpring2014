To the Editor:
Re ''How to Measure Student Proficiency? States Disagree on Setting Standards and Tests'' (Education page, Dec. 31):
The lack of nationwide test standards under the federal No Child  Left Behind law indeed presents a dilemma.
It is absurd that schools in states that aim for higher educational achievement face punitive measures, while those that set the bar lower are largely immune. Since the tests are mandated by federal law to evaluate all our schools, there is simply no reason there should be state-to-state variation in test standards.
By contrast, there is an inherently wide variation in the capabilities and talents of individual children.
A true policy of ''no child left behind'' would ensure that each child is taught in a manner that maximizes his or her potential.
