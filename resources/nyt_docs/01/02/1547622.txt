'Nudes in the Landscape'
New York Studio School  8 West Eighth Street  Greenwich Village  Through Jan. 17
Tradition can be suffocating, or it can be like a good mother: there for you but letting you have your own life. There's plenty of life in the paintings of Lois Dodd, whose five-decade career has remained firmly rooted in the early Modernism of artists like Cézanne and Matisse. Ms. Dodd's two exhibitions of small panel paintings -- rural landscapes at Alexandre Gallery and outdoor nudes at the New York Studio School -- bring two forms of life infectiously together: that of the airy, color- and light-struck world and that of brusquely sensuous paint.
Made outdoors in Maine and New Jersey, Ms. Dodd's landscapes are from one perspective pastoral romances. She is drawn to unpopulated places -- abandoned quarries, ponds, woods and fields -- and even her pictures of suburban houses have a Hopperesque lonesomeness. Out of the emptiness emerges an understated pantheistic mystery. But another mood arises from the taut, boxy compositions and vigorous, jabbing action of Ms. Dodd's wide, generously loaded brush. Her paintings remind us that Modernism is an urban phenomenon. They get the job done with no-nonsense efficiency and a city-dweller's competitive élan.
While Ms. Dodd's blocky, simplified female nudes painted in a Maine backyard are obviously descended from Cézanne's bathers, her playful approach is blessedly free of academic stuffiness. In several, she poses the figure on a woodpile, setting up a witty conversation between humanism and Cubism.
