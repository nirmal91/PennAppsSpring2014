To the Editor:
Re ''Our So-Called Boom,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Dec. 30):
The worsening wealth disparity between the top and bottom strata of our society, as well as the evaporating myth of upward mobility, are troubling trends that are emblematic of the values held by the Bush administration.
Tax cuts that primarily benefit those in the highest tax brackets, Medicare ''reform'' that is actually a generous handout to the health care industry and cuts in overtime pay are just three policies that clearly show which segment of American society is being served by the administration.
