To the Editor:
Re ''Homicides Surge in City as Year Nears End'' (news article, Dec. 31):
The temptation to focus on the number of homicides at the expense of their broader social context calls to mind an anecdote from Albert Camus recounted by his biographer, Herbert R. Lottman.
When Camus was asked during a brief visit to New York in 1946 how many people were in the French Resistance during World War II, Camus dismissively gave an exact figure like ''360,728.'' His point was that, in such situations, numbers don't count.
Similarly, we need to wake up from the hypnotic thrall cast by numbers to ask why guns are so readily available -- and why we are so quick to use them.
