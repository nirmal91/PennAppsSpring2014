To the Editor:
Re ''Pork Shortage for the Homeless'' (editorial, Dec. 27):
On Christmas Eve, I awoke in my warm, cozy apartment overlooking the park, pleasantly anticipating a family gathering to celebrate the day. Looking out at the park, I saw an old, homeless man. Stooped, he shuffled slowly down the street in the rain, pulling a bag-filled cart behind him.
That image is burned in my brain. How can this be? Today? In America?
