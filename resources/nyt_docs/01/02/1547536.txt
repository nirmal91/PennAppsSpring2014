To the Editor:
Prof. Lizabeth Cohen's comments about the need for leisure (Arts &amp; Ideas, Dec. 27) recalled the sonnet by William Wordsworth, ''The World Is Too Much With Us.'' The second and third lines are: ''Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers; / Little we see in Nature that is ours.''
For those who have to struggle every minute to survive, the poem may seem irrelevant. But for the vast majority of Americans, the poem urges us at least to examine how we are living and to question whether a 24/7 lifestyle is imperative.
