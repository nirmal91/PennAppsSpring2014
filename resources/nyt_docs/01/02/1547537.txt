To the Editor:
Re ''Fighting for the Footprints of Sept. 11'' (news article, Dec. 30):
To preserve the site as is memorializes ''ground zero,'' not Sept. 11.
The space is not sacred because people died there but because they were murdered solely because of who they were: Americans. And it is sacred because hundreds of others sacrificed their lives to try to save them.
The memorial must not first be for the families, nor should it be about ''memory.'' It must first be for future generations with no memory of the event. There they will learn about Sept. 11, and they must be inspired to learn more.
Regardless of poll results, the designs are still generic. Consequently, they have little humanity, no evil; little tragedy, no sacrifice. Nothing of America. This is not Sept. 11.
