To the Editor:
It's unfortunate that those in power do not see homeless people as constituents, people with a voice who vote (editorial, Dec. 27). As a result, dedicating sufficient resources to solving the root of the problem -- decent and affordable housing, access to quality health care and education, and living-wage jobs -- is usually off the political radar screen.
But our political leaders should walk into any homeless shelter today and they'll see their neighbors -- and constituents. They'll meet low-wage workers from their town whose incomes have been eclipsed by escalating rents; women from around the corner who are victims of domestic abuse; and perhaps most tragically, classmates of their young children.
As you note, solving the problem is within our reach. It takes political will -- and capital. And it's money well spent on long-term solutions that promises to break the cycle threatening to engulf another generation of Americans.
