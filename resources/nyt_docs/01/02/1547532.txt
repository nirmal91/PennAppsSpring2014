ADA MONROE (Nicole Kidman) comes to wish she knew less about the piano and flower arranging and more about how to wring a rooster's neck. Ada, the heroine of the Civil War film ''Cold Mountain,'' which opened on Christmas Day, suffers hardships of the heart as well. Just as she and her new love (Jude Law) have shared their first passionate kisses, he has to go off to fight for the South. Hollywood has a long tradition of movies set from 1861 to 1865. Some are love  stories, some are morality plays and some are actually about the battles. These 10 films, available on video or DVD, offer tastes of each.

Correction:  January 6, 2004, Tuesday  An article in Weekend on Friday about Civil War films available on video or DVD misspelled the given name of a Confederate general who appears as a character in ''Gettysburg.'' He was Lewis Armistead, not Louis. The article also misstated the release year for ''Virginia City.'' It was 1940, not 1949.
