To the Editor:
Re ''A Pound of Prevention'' (editorial, Dec. 31): In a much-criticized decision more than three years ago, the American Red Cross tightened the criteria for blood donors who spent time in Europe to protect people against the brain-destroying disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
As regulators, scientists and medical personnel grapple with the first case of mad cow disease in the United States, and the first case of a person dying from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after a blood transfusion in Britain, the Red Cross policy remains prudent and will prove lifesaving.
With enormous scientific uncertainty, no blood test and a long latency period before the disease can be detected, the Red Cross -- specifically, Dr. Bernadine Healy, its former president -- should be applauded for a courageous decision.
