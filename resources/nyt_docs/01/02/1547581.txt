Last year, almost everything went up in the stock market, ending a string of three years in which the major averages declined each year. Of the 8,180 issues -- common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, closed-end funds, exchange traded funds and everything else -- traded on the New York  Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market, 87  percent of them rose in 2003, after a year in which only 41 percent gained.
