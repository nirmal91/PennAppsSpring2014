ARMS swinging rhythmically, briefcase in tow, a skater glides to work over the frozen surface of the 170-year-old canal that winds nearly five miles through the heart of the city. Parents push bundled-up babies across the ice in sleighs; and French- and English- speaking vendors sell hot chocolate at warming huts and fire pits. This is the winter scene in Ottawa, Canada's capital, an uncommonly civilized city of about 800,000. Frequent blizzards give way to crisp, sunny skies, the neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings rise majestically on a limestone escarpment above the Ottawa River, and the rolling Gatineau Hills crease the northwest skyline. Ottawa has undergone a transformation in recent years, caused in part by an influx of high-tech companies: there are still 39 museums, scarlet-clad Mounties and about 120 foreign embassies, but the city now boasts the highest percentage of Internet-connected households in Canada and enough good restaurants to satisfy the most demanding foodie.

Friday
6 p.m.  1. Winter People  Head down the Sparks Street Mall to D'arcy McGee's Irish Pub (44 Sparks Street, 613-230-4433) for a pint of Guinness (about $5; all prices are in United States dollars) and prime people-watching: policy wonks from Parliament Hill brush up against actors and musicians from the National Arts Centre and players from the Ottawa Senators of the N.H.L. It's a short walk to the ByWard Market area for dinner, but button up because Ottawa is the second-coldest capital in the world, after Ulan Bator, Mongolia.
8 p.m.  2. Dinner Party  In the 1800's, the ByWard Market was a shantytown, crowded with Irish and French immigrant canal builders. Now, it's one of Ottawa's most vibrant neighborhoods, with old buildings, cobblestone alleys, more than 100 restaurants and clubs, and a bustling year-round farmers' market. Among the best choices for dinner is Domus (87 Murray Street, 613-241-6007), a storefront cafe. The menu changes daily, and recent main courses included slow-roasted breast of Muscovy duck (about $21). Or reserve a table by the fire at Eighteen (18 York Street, 613-244-1188), which offers modern French cuisine in a renovated 18th-century cheese-processing factory. Nearby, at Social (537 Sussex Drive, 613-789-7355), René Rodriguez, the chef, serves up great bistro-style food; the oven-roasted salmon fillet ($15) is terrific. On weekends, D.J.'s spin tunes in the bar until 2 a.m.
10 p.m.  3. High Rollers  Take a cab on the picturesque Alexandra Bridge over the Ottawa River to the city of Gatineau, Quebec. (Gatineau, Ottawa and the surrounding towns form the National Capital Region.) At the Casino du Lac-Leamy, the croupiers are bilingual and exceedingly polite, and with the United States dollar valued at about 1.30 Canadian dollars, American visitors can gamble longer than they might at home.
Saturday
9 a.m.  4. Mr. Smith Goes to Ottawa  Start the day with a tour of the Parliament Buildings on Wellington Street (613-992-4793). Free tours of the Centre Block run daily from 9 a.m. to 3:20 p.m. Until Jan. 12 the tour includes the Senate and House of Commons chambers while members are on recess. Finish your visit with the spectacular views from the observation deck of the Peace Tower. As you leave Parliament Hill, don't miss the dozens of cats that live behind the complex and are cared for by René Chartrand, an octogenarian who uses his own money to tend the strays; there is a donation box.
11 a.m.  5. Secret Garden  Walk north on Sussex Drive to the National Gallery of Canada (380 Sussex Drive, 613-990-1985), where a few moments spent admiring the blossoms in J. E. H. MacDonald's 1916 painting ''The Tangled Garden'' should melt any winter chill. This acclaimed museum, with soaring glass concourses and serene courtyards, holds the largest collection of Canadian art in the world. Admission to the permanent collection is free, and weekend hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Across from the museum is the Nicholas Hoare Bookstore (419 Sussex Drive, 613-562-2665) with a fireplace and an extensive selection of Canadian and British books.
Noon  6. A Trip to Bountiful  Ottawa residents are proud of the city's cultural diversity, and no visit is complete without an internationally flavored lunch tour of the ByWard Market. Pick up a superb Lebanese falafel ($3) at the Huff &amp; Puff Restaurant (97 Clarence Street, 613-562-4984), and try the Moroccan couscous with yams and caramelized onions ($5) at Yayora Express (55 ByWard Market, 613-562-0886). Savor a piping-hot bowl of pasta fagioli ($4) at La Bottega Fine Food Shop (64 George Street, 613-789-7575). Next stop: the Blooming Onion, a chip truck at York and Dalhousie Streets, for poutine, a French-Canadian delicacy of thick-cut fries topped with cheese curds and gravy ($2.50). For dessert, pick up some baklava ($1.25) from Aux Délices (32 ByWard Market, 613-241-9292) or a BeaverTail, a cooked-to-order pastry (about $2.70), from the stand at George and William Streets, and stock up on Canadian maple syrup at an outdoor stall.
1 p.m.  7. The Long and Winding Rink  Rent skates or a push-sleigh (either is about $12 for two hours) at kiosks on the Rideau Canal and work off your lunch on what is billed as the world's longest rink. (Call 613-239-5234 to determine if ice conditions allow skating.) Night skating is also a big draw: rest areas stay open until 10, but skaters may linger under the moonlight. The canal is the focus of the Winterlude Festival in February (800-465-1867), which includes an ice sculpture contest and a 20-kilometer triathlon (skating, cross-country skiing, running). Those who prefer sledding can grab a toboggan and head to the steep hill in the arboretum at the Central Experimental Farm (Prince of Wales Drive, 613-991-3044), a 1,000-acre research farm in the middle of the city. Leave time to visit the animal barn, where Goody, the 2,500-pound Hereford bull, is a star attraction.
3:45 p.m.  8. The Royal Treatment  To soothe your tired muscles, book one of the last massages of the day at the York Street Spa (11 York Street, 613-562-2121). A 60-minute deep-tissue massage is about $66.
8 p.m.  9. Big Night  Head west of the canal to the Centretown neighborhood, because everyone is talking about Beckta Dining &amp; Wine (226 Nepean Street, 613-238-7063). The owner, Stephen Beckta, an Ottawa native and a former sommelier at Café Boulud in Manhattan, offers ambitious modern French food in an elegant Victorian house. Try the caramelized Lunenberg scallops with celeriac fritters and sweet corn ($22).
Sunday
10 a.m.  10. Snow Business  Fill your lungs with country air in Quebec's 90,000-acre Gatineau Park, a 15-minute drive from Parliament Hill. There is one downhill area, and over 125 miles of trails for snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and winter hiking. Snowshoes can be rented for $3.90 an hour at the Gatineau Park Visitor Center (33 Scott Road in Chelsea, Quebec; 819-827-2020). Skis and snowboards can be rented from various outfitters near the park entrance.
1 p.m.  11. Bon Appétit  Stop in for a well-earned brunch nearby at Les Fougères (783 Route 105, Chelsea; 819-827-8942), known for its lamb, red pepper and chèvre tourtière ($11). When returning to the city, take the Alexandra Bridge for the best farewell views.
