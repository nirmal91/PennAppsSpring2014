Florida State quarterback Chris Rix was the most maligned Seminole entering the Orange Bowl. His turnovers against Miami the past three seasons had led to 39 of the Hurricanes' 99 points.
Rix, who acknowledged that his cellphone this week was full of irate messages from a variety of callers, did not gift-wrap any points for Miami on Thursday night, but the Seminoles still fell victim to Miami, 16-14, before 76,739 at Pro Player Stadium.
When Xavier Beitia was wide right -- what else? -- on a 39-yard field-goal attempt with 5 minutes 30 seconds left, it marked the fifth time since 1991 that a missed field goal had cost F.S.U. a chance at victory against the Hurricanes.
It happened in 1991, 1992, 2000 and 2002. Beitia missed a 43-yarder wide left against Miami as time expired in 2002, allowing the Hurricanes to prevail, 28-27.
The victory Thursday night gave Miami, a 22-14 regular-season victor over F.S.U., an 11-2 record. The Seminoles ended 10-3.
F.S.U. did put a final scare into the Hurricanes after D. J. Ward blocked Jon Beattie's 45-field goal attempt with 2:18 left. F.S.U. quickly reached the Miami 48 but then incurred 25 yards in penalties. The Seminoles' hopes ended on three Rix incompletions.
Rix completed only 6 of 19 passes for 96 yards. He threw one interception and had a touchdown pass.
The Hurricanes outgained Florida State by 375 yards to 206 yards. Miami running back Jarrett Payton, who rushed for 131 yards on 22 carries, was named the game's most valuable player.
''I just wanted to have a better game against them than the first time we played,'' Payton said.
After trailing by 14-13 at halftime, it didn't take the Hurricanes long to seize the lead. It came on Peattie's 51-yard field goal, a career long, 4:41 into the third quarter.
Miami took the opening kickoff 59 yards in 9 plays, but the drive stalled and Peattie kicked a 32-yard field goal.
On F.S.U.'s first possession, Rix was hit around the head by linebacker Jonathan Vilma as he threw. No penalty was called, and safety Sean Taylor, who intercepted Rix twice in Miami's regular-season victory over the Seminoles, was there again.
Miami threatened on its third possession, but after reaching the Seminoles' 35-yard-line, Brock Berlin's pass intended for wide receiver Roscoe Parrish was tipped and then intercepted by Jerome Carter in the end zone.
The Seminoles used Rix's 52-yard pass to wide receiver Chauncey Stovall -- just out of safety Maurice Sikes' reach -- to take the lead.
Stovall's reception put them at the Hurricanes' 18, and three plays later running back Lorenzo Booker scored on a 9-yard run around right end. Sikes had Booker around the waist at the 3 on the second quarter's first play, but he couldn't prevent him from diving into the end zone.
F.S.U. capitalized on a woefully miss-hit punt by Miami's Brian Monroe to take a 14-3 lead.
Starting at the Miami 39-yard line because of the 8-yard kick, the Seminoles eked out a first down on Rix's plunge, then saw 255-pound Greg Jones burst through the middle for 24 yards, running over the 225-pound Taylor in the process.
Two plays later, Rix rolled left and found tight end Matt Henshaw alone for a 7-yard touchdown.
As if insulted, the Hurricanes began to flex their running-game muscle. Runs and a 5-yard penalty produced all but 8 yards of a 79-yard, 7-play maneuver as they drew within 14-10. The big play was running back Jarrett Payton's 46-yard sprint around the left side on a third-and-2, with a facemask penalty tacked on.
The freshman running back Tyrone Moss finished the drive on a 3-yard run with 5:34 left in the quarter.
After F.S.U. couldn't move, the Hurricanes kept their momentum going with Peattie's 44-yard field goal as time expired in the half.
