The mid-1970's saw a new generation of landscape photographers reject the romanticism of artists like Ansel Adams, Minor White and Edward Weston in favor of documentary, emotionally neutral views of human adaptation to nature. In 1975 ''New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape,'' organized by William Jenkins at the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House in Rochester, put this movement on the map. Among those included were Robert Adams, Lewis Baltz, Stephen Shore, Bernd and Hilla Becher and Joe Deal, the subject of this absorbing exhibition.
The show's main event is ''The Fault Zone,'' a series of 19 square black-and-white pictures of suburban homes, rocky hills, dirt roads, construction sites and other nondescript scenes, all taken from 1978 to 1980 along the San Andreas fault line in Southern California. Other works survey suburban backyards in Diamond Bar, Calif., and coastal communities like Laguna Beach and Malibu.
Though overtly possessed of a dry, quasi-scientific objectivity, in their tendency to focus on less than admirable instances of human industry Mr. Deal's photographs are animated by moral and polemical urgencies. ''The Fault Zone'' in particular suggests that our feckless expansionism is bound to receive its ecological comeuppance one day, a new kind of Manifest Destiny.
