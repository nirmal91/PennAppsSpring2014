Older Americans are far more likely than previous generations to have kept their teeth, but a newly published survey found huge variations by state and income.
The results of the survey of almost 50,000 people older than 65 conducted in 2002 were published last month in The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the 1950's, a majority of people over 65 had no teeth, said an editorial that accompanied the article. But the survey found that most older people today had lost only five teeth or fewer, a change that it said was a tribute to fluoridated water and toothpaste and improved dental care.
But the disparities found in the survey were as striking as the overall trend. In Hawaii and California, only 13 percent of those surveyed reported having lost all their teeth. In Kentucky and West Virginia, 42 percent had. In Utah, 64 percent said they still had almost all their teeth; that figure was 27 percent in West Virginia and 34 percent in Mississippi.
The differences were just as big when the data were analyzed in other ways. Only 30 percent of those with incomes below $15,000 a year had most of their teeth, compared with 73 percent with incomes of $50,000 or more. Just over half of whites and Hispanic Americans reported having most of their teeth, while 30 percent of blacks did. Smokers also lost teeth far more rapidly.
Dr. James B. Bramson, the executive director of the American Dental Association, said that other research had shown correlations between tooth retention and factors like fluoride in water and toothpaste and access to regular dental care. ''Preventive measures work,'' he said.
