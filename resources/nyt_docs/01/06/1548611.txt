Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate blamed by many Democrats for denying Al Gore the 2000 presidential election, has not ruled out running again this year.
Appearing on the CNN program ''Crossfire,'' he said he would decide this month whether to enter the race. But if he does, he has said, it will be as an independent, not as the candidate for the Green Party, as he was four years ago. The Green Party will not decide until June whether it wants to run a candidate, and that, he said, ''is too late.''
