To the Editor:
Re ''Facing Up to the Inevitable, in Search of a Good Death'' (Dec. 30): In many cases, a patient's death can be eased with the help of a health care proxy chosen carefully in advance.
Even so, patients' loved ones will often ask a question that should never be uttered: Is there even the slightest possibility that the patient will recover? Since miracles can occur, the answer is always yes. That obligates the physician to do everything possible to prolong life, often at the expense of the patient's comfort.
The best way to ensure a peaceful death is for the health care proxy to accept that the patient is dying. Only then can physicians feel comfortable enough -- both legally and ethically -- to make the process as smooth and painless as possible.
