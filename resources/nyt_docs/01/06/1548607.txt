After six weeks of deliberation, the jury assembled to choose a memorial for the site of the World Trade Center has made its decision, which it will announce today.
''The jury is very pleased with the deliberations,'' said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which has presided over the competition.
The jurors began deliberating yesterday morning at Gracie Mansion, and did not emerge until shortly before 11 p.m. A person familiar with the daylong discussions said that debate was passionate, but not heated, and added that the winning design was not a conglomeration of different proposals but rather an adaptation of one of the final designs.
At the beginning of the six-week selection process, the 8 finalists and 13 jurors were instructed not to speak to the media. Last night the jurors declined comment.
The full description of the winning design will not be made until next week, said Matthew Higgins, the corporation's chief operating officer.
The jury has been under intense pressure since the announcement of the finalists on Nov. 19. The memorial is the centerpiece of the site, and Gov. George E. Pataki has insisted that ground for the skyscraper be broken by September this year, the third anniversary of the terror attack.
But critics have argued against a rush to judgment. ''This is something that's going to last forever,'' Rudolph W. Giuliani said last month in calling publicly for a time out. ''Doing it right is more important than doing it on any particular timetable.''
