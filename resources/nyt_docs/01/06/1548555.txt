To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that the Bush administration has no domestic philosophy (column, Jan. 3). In fact, accountability and competition are its watchwords.
Look at the landmark education legislation, No Child Left Behind. All schools must now report test results for students (accountability). Schools that fail to meet their performance goals can face consequences including permitting students to transfer to another school (competition).
Other areas of government services are similarly experiencing applications of this philosophy.
Though not sexy, the Bush philosophy of accountability and competition is definitely changing the way government operates!
