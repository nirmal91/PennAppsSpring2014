Fashion devotees unfortunate enough not to have planned a winter holiday in Nevis or Oaxaca often find themselves suffering from consumer impatience in January. Too forward thinking to shop the winter sales, they feel compelled to buy something springlike right now.
''This is the gateway purchase,'' said Sarah Easley, an owner of Kirna Zabête, coining the phrase as she spoke. ''In high school we were taught about the gateway drugs, like alcohol and marijuana. Well, this is sort of like that.''
The gateway purchase, then, is a small preseasonal acquisition that can lead to costlier indulgences later. It can also be used right now. At Kirna Zabête, a particular Chloé handbag that comes in citrus colors has emerged as a gateway purchase. ''It will be nine degrees on Thursday, but you can still wear it,'' Ms. Easley explained.
At Intermix, prespring cravings have been satisfied by a Moschino handbag with polka dots as well as by a new shoe from the label. ''It's got, like, five colors and a ball on the top,'' said Decia Lazarian, one of the store's managers.
Striped polo sweaters from Malo have sparked interest at Linda Dresner, Pucci scarves at Henri Bendel. ''If you look outside, it's horrible,'' Ed Burstell, Bendel's general manager, said. ''Then you look at a Pucci scarf -- they're happy.''
