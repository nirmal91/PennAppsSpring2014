To the Editor:
Re ''British Cancel Another Flight Bound for U.S.'' (front page, Jan. 3):
It seems that we are getting too complacent. Tom Ridge and the Department of Homeland Security raised the terror alert to orange for the holidays; nothing happened. People yawned. Now we force our friends and neighbors, the British and British Airways and the Mexicans and Aerom√©xico, to cancel flights. Personally, I don't feel any safer because of this.
After Sept. 11, 2001, I took many airplane trips. I was chosen every time I flew to be carefully searched. I am a 62-year-old grandmother. I am white with blond hair and blue eyes and am tall and thin.
I didn't feel any safer flying. My husband, who was on every flight with me, is a 63-year-old balding white male, and was never singled out for careful screening.
I think there is a genuine threat lurking somewhere out there. I just don't think that Tom Ridge and the Homeland Security Department are competent enough to figure out what it is.
