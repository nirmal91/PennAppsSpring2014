Alana Beard had 19 points to set a team scoring record, and host Duke extended its streak of Atlantic Coast Conference victories to 45 last night by beating Florida State, 79-66, in its first game as the nation's top-ranked team.
Mistie Bass added 11 points and Monique Currie 10 for Duke (11-1, 2-0), which took over the No. 1 spot yesterday as a result of its victory Saturday over Connecticut, which dropped to fourth from No. 1. The victory was Duke's 11th straight since its season-opening loss to Texas.
The Blue Devils jumped from fourth to edge No. 2 Texas Tech (14-0) and No. 3 Texas (12-1). Duke and Texas Tech each received 20 of the 46 first-place votes from a national media panel, but the Blue Devils had a 13-point lead in total points, 1,104 to 1,091.
Beard surpassed the previous mark of 2,232 career points by Chris Moreland (1985-89) with a put-back of her own miss with 13:08 left in the first half. She finished the game with 2,248 points.
RICE 87, LOUISIANA TECH 84
Lauren Neaves made a free throw and a basket in the final minute of overtime, and Rice upset eighth-ranked Louisiana Tech in Houston.
Louisiana Tech (8-2, 1-1 Western Athletic Conference) led by as many as 4 points in overtime before the score was tied at 82-82. Neaves hit the go-ahead free throw and followed with a field goal with 24 seconds to go for Rice (5-6, 1-1).
