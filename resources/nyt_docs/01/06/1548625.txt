Advertisements for a car financing plan instituted by Ford after the demise of auto leasing in New York State are misleading, and advertisers have agreed to change them, the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday. An agreement between Mr. Spitzer's office and dealership ad associations will result in clearer print, radio, television and direct-mail ads, Mr. Spitzer said. Ford and Lincoln Mercury dealers had used a so-called Red Carpet Option plan, a plan with low monthly installments and an option to buy the vehicle at the end of the loan period by meeting a final ''balloon'' payment. Mr. Spitzer charged that advertisements for the plan failed to disclose the balloon payment and details on qualifying for rebates. As part of the agreement, eight advertising associations representing Lincoln Mercury and Ford dealerships have agreed to pay $60,000 in penalties and costs.
