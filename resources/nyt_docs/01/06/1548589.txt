To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''Stampede of Diabetes as U.S. Races to Obesity'' (Dec. 23): With the epidemic of obesity and its dreaded consequences upon us, national eating habits must change.
It would seem logical that certain segments of our society are already enlightened. But while recently attending an important medical conference, I was horrified to see throngs of physicians heartily eating muffins, cakes and supersized doughnuts for breakfast.
Perhaps the message has not been heard so loud and clear.
