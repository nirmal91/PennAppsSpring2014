A prisoner being held in a special cell in Central Booking because of a medical condition was found unconscious and was later declared dead, apparently of a heart attack, the police said yesterday. The man was carrying medication when he was arrested, the police said, but it was taken from him at the station house in the Sixth Precinct, where he was arrested for criminal tampering. A police spokesman said he could not identify the medication. The man, whose name was not released pending notification of his family, was 46 and apparently homeless, the police said. They said he had been arrested more than 70 times.
