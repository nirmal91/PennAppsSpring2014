To the Editor:
Re ''British Cancel Another Flight Bound for U.S.'' (front page, Jan. 3):
Before canceling a recent flight, President Bush had a threshold question for Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge: ''Would you let your son or daughter fly on that plane?'' When the two men agreed that they would not, the flight was canceled.
Would that President Bush had asked a similar threshold question of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld before the two men agreed to drop bombs on Iraq.
