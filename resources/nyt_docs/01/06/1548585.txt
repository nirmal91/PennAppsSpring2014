To the Editor:
The description of how some doctors react to a patient's terminal illness does not take into account the response simply of one human being to another (''Facing Up to the Inevitable'').
When my husband died of prostate cancer nearly four years ago I did receive a call from the oncologist who treated him for a month or two. But to this day I have never heard one word from our longtime family doctor.
For obvious reasons, he is no longer my doctor.
