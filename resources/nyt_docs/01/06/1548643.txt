A court turned down a request by a state prosecutor to hold Mullah Krekar, the founder of the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Islam, for a month pending an investigation into his supposed role in the attempted murders of his political rivals in northern Iraq two years ago. The prosecutor has asked the Oslo District Court to keep Mr. Krekar, a Kurd, in jail through Friday pending an appeal of the ruling, according to The Associated Press.
