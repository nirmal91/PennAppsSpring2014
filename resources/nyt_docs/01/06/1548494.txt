The death of a fifth hospital or nursing home patient is being investigated as possibly connected to a nurse who prosecutors say has admitted killing dozens of patients, the authorities said yesterday.
The patient in the latest case died at Easton Hospital in Northampton County, Pa., while the nurse, Charles Cullen, was employed there, from November 1998 to March 1999. Two Rivers Corporation, which owned the hospital at the time, announced the investigation yesterday but would not release the name of the patient or the details of the death. Two county investigators said the patient was an elderly man.
The death is the second linked to Mr. Cullen's stint at Easton, one of 10 health care facilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey where he worked during a 16-year career. The police are also investigating the death of a man at a nursing home in Allentown in 1998.
In New Jersey, the Somerset County prosecutor's office has said that Mr. Cullen, 43, confessed to killing as many as 40 patients. The office has charged him with murder and attempted murder in two deaths involving patients at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville. Prosecutors in Pennsylvania have not charged him.
Paul Brunswick, the president of Two Rivers, said the patient in the latest Easton case had an ''extremely low serum glucose level prior to death.'' Such a low level is rarely a natural occurrence but can be induced with an insulin injection.
Donald Auten, the spokesman and attorney for Two Rivers, said an autopsy was performed at Easton. Mr. Auten would not say what the cause of death was.
