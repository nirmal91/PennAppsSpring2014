Eye injuries from paintball games have increased among children, even as the protective gear for the sport has improved, according to a study released yesterday.
The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, said the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated the number of emergency room visits for eye injuries caused by paintballs at 545 in 1998 and more than 1,200 in 2000. More than 40 percent of those injuries were believed to involve children, the study said.
Paintballs are marble-sized gelatin capsules filled with water-soluble paint. They are fired at velocities of up to 300 feet a second, the study said. Because they are so small, they can fit inside the bones meant to protect the eye.
The study's author, Dr. David A. Listman of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, said commercial paintball centers had generally switched to full face masks, which have become more effective at protecting the eyes than earlier gear. But most injuries now occur in backyard play, which is more likely to involve teenagers or children. ''The injuries being seen are overwhelmingly in people who did not wear the proper, or for that matter any, safety equipment,'' Dr. Listman said.
Those injuries can involve permanent damage to vision, he said.
Dr. Listman said he believed that paintball guns should be restricted to regulated sites. In the absence of such action, parents should limit children's access to the guns and insist on proper protection. Paintball guns ''should be treated with the same respect as any other firearm,'' he said. ''These are the only guns that are made to shoot at your friends.''
