An article in Business Day on Saturday about the role of consultants in advising companies on moving some operations overseas misspelled the surname of the chief executive of one such firm, TPI. He is Dennis A. McGuire, not McGwire.
The article also misidentified the firm that advised Procter &amp; Gamble on its offshore operations. It was Arthur Andersen, not Andersen Consulting (now called Accenture).
