The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said Monday that British troops would stay in Iraq for years, perhaps as long as 2007, to help restore the country's security and stability.
In a BBC radio interview, Mr. Straw said he could not offer a precise timeline for the pullout of troops. ''I can't say whether it's going to be 2006, 2007,'' he said, but added, ''It's not going to be months, for sure.''
American and British officials have been vague about how long troops will be stationed in Iraq, speaking only of a long-term commitment to the country. Making his case for an extended military stay, Mr. Straw said it was essential for forces to remain in Iraq for years to come to oversee the country's rehabilitation.
But he said Iraq's new government must agree to any decision to maintain troops there for the long haul.
Comparing the situation with the one in Afghanistan, where troops have been stationed for two and a half years, Mr. Straw said the troops would play a vital role in helping Iraq form and foster a new political process.
''If we were suddenly to pull out, there would be unquestionably a security vacuum that would not only put lives at risk and cause a loss of life but would also be a setback for the political process,'' he said.
His remarks came a day after Prime Minister Tony Blair paid a surprise visit to British troops in Basra. At the same time, Britain is awaiting a report by a senior judge, Lord Hutton, on whether the intelligence on Iraq's illicit weapons was embellished by Mr. Blair and his aides in order to make a case for war.
Mr. Straw said occupation forces would continue to work toward the July 1 deadline for handing over power to Iraqi authorities.
