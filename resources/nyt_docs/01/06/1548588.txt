To the Editor:
Re ''Sheep Ailment May Hold Clues to Mad Cow Disease'' (Dec. 30): Mad cow has many unknowns, but it is a known fact that there are fast and effective methods of testing cows for it, and they would add little more than a few cents per pound to the price of beef. Are our public officials so beholden to the meat industry that they cannot see the need for this testing, or are they just plain mad?
The market will surely punish the failure to do what is right.
