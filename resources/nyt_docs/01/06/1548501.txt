Jets Coach Herman Edwards continued his efforts to rebuild his defensive staff yesterday, interviewing the Giants' defensive coordinator, Johnnie Lynn.
Lynn is also a guru of the secondary, so he could be in line for the defensive backs job; the incumbent, Bill Bradley, was fired last week. Edwards has spoken to the former Buffalo coach Gregg Williams about the defensive coordinator spot. But the Jets' pursuit of Tampa Bay's defensive line coach, Rod Marinelli -- who is believed to be Edwards's first choice for the job -- is being held up.
Tampa Bay is without a general manager, and the Buccaneers will wait for that position to be filled before deciding whether to give Marinelli permission to interview with the Jets. Edwards is scheduled to interview the Giants' defensive line coach, Denny Marcin, today, and he, too, could be in line for a position coach job.
The Jets also want to talk to Tennessee's linebackers coach, Gunther Cunningham, and Philadelphia's linebackers coach, Ron Rivera, about the coordinator job, but they cannot talk to them while their teams are in the playoffs.
