A former deputy director of Eurostat, the statistics arm of the European Union, was charged with ''breach of trust'' in an embezzlement case that was opened last April, the prosecutor, Evelyne Picard, said. Daniel Byk is the first government employee to have been charged for helping to organize a complicated system of accounting frauds and secret slush funds at Eurostat. At least 5 million euros ($6.3 million) have disappeared, according to internal audits. The president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, above, and the economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Pedro Solbes, were under fire for the commission's handling of the case before Mr. Prodi announced stronger whistle-blowing protocols in November.
