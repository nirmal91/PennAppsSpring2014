Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, a former Dutch foreign minister, took office as secretary general of NATO, hoping to transform the alliance into a important player in the war against terrorism. His first goal, he said, is to expand the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. He said repairing the strained relations among the 19 NATO members as a result of the war in Iraq was another priority, and he has already scheduled trips to Washington, London, Paris and Berlin in coming weeks. Mr. de Hoop Scheffer, 55, succeeds Lord Robertson, a Scotsman who served as secretary of defense in Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet.
