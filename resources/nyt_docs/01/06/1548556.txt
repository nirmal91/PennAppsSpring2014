To the Editor:
David Brooks (column, Jan. 3) considers the Republican Party the party of reform, while according to him, the Democrats remain committed to the status quo -- reform being good for the country, and status quo, of course, being bad.
We have seen the administration's reform efforts -- the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires school districts to provide services for which there may be no money; and proposed changes in welfare that will create more families requiring child care assistance but will not provide enough money for that purpose.
Despite the president's ''compassionate conservatism,'' it is clear to many of us that in the mind of this administration, reform means the reduction or elimination of services that help those who have the least in society while advancing the welfare of those who have the most.
