Worldwide sales of semiconductors in 2004 are likely to surpass the 15.8 percent growth rate that the Semiconductor Industry Association forecast last year, the trade group announced yesterday. The association, based in Washington, said the chip industry experienced particularly strong growth during November, the latest month with data available, with strong demand across all markets driven mostly by rising sales of personal computers and wireless devices. Worldwide chip sales were $16.13 billion in November 2003, a 4.5 percent increase from the $15.43 billion in October, and a 25.7 percent rise from November 2002. George M. Scalise, president of the association, said that the last half of 2003 was among the strongest periods on record for the chip industry.
