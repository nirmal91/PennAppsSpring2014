''The Producers'' produced last week.
With the return of its original stars, Nathan Lane as the conniving Max Bialystock and Matthew Broderick as his anxiety-prone accomplice, Leo Bloom, the hit Mel Brooks musical at the St. James Theater pulled in a Broadway record $1,600,243, the show's press agents, Barlow-Hartman, said yesterday.
The League of American Theaters and Producers said the amount was in fact a record unless surpassed by other shows' take last week, which will be reported today.
The ''Producers'' figure reflected the gross take after box office commissions and other fees are deducted. The week ran from Dec. 30, when Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick re-entered the cast, through Sunday, and the $1.6 million included sales of tickets for the New Year's Eve show that were priced at $600.
The audience that night got a surprise in the second act, when Mr. Brooks himself appeared onstage in the role of the judge at the trial of Bialystock and Bloom.
The $1.6 million eclipsed the show's previous weekly high, $1.35 million in March 2002. Attendance last week was 13,659, less than capacity.
