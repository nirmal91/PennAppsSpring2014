To the Editor:
''That Parent-Child Conversation Is Becoming Instant, and Online'' (front page, Jan. 3) suggests that people who are having difficulty communicating with one another can talk more freely online because they are not looking directly at each other.
Yet this is the problem with instant messaging. E-mail messages can distort anger and exaggerate negative affect.
The same comment transmitted face to face may be accompanied by an ambivalence conveyed by the eyes or facial expressions.
People are sometimes less willing to say nasty things in an interpersonal setting than through e-mail because they realize that the other person may retaliate.
It is usually best not to express certain emotions (like anger) in e-mail messages, but instead to air them interpersonally, where the full range of human emotions can be shared in a more intimate and honest fashion.
