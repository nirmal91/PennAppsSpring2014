To the Editor:
Britney Spears can get married in Las Vegas on a whim and have it annulled within days (''Las Vegas: Bridal Britney?,'' Arts Briefing, Jan. 5), but gay people like me, who have been in a loving, faithful, monogamous relationship with one partner for more than a dozen years, are not allowed to marry because some say we would damage the institution of marriage.
Is something wrong with this picture?
