To the Editor:
I read ''That Parent-Child Conversation Is Becoming Instant, and Online'' (front page, Jan. 3) with much distress.
In other parts of the world, a vast majority live on less than $1 a day and would consider the most basic hut without indoor plumbing a luxury.
In the United States, our wealth has engendered sprawling suburbs in which houses are so large that parents and children use the Internet to communicate between rooms.
Conspicuous consumption is on the rise in the United States, as evidenced by the increasingly common suburban McMansion and unnecessarily large S.U.V.'s (generally with one or two passengers in them).
Where are our priorities?
