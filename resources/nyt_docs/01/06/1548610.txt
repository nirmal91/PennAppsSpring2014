Focusing on health care issues as he swung through New Hampshire, the crucial first-primary state, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut outlined a proposal to cut in half the number of preventable medical mistakes in five years.
Mr. Lieberman said he would reduce those mistakes by requiring anonymous reporting of deaths and serious injuries caused by medical errors, creating a center to conduct research into reducing medical errors and establishing public-private partnerships to pursue appropriate strategies.
Mr. Lieberman said about 100,000 Americans died each year from preventable mistakes, at a cost of $29 billion.
His proposal is part of a broader plan he has been promoting to increase the number of people insured and lower the cost of health care by creating pools to negotiate with insurers.
