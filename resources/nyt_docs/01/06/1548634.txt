An article on Saturday about the decision of Representative Ralph M. Hall, a longtime Texas Democrat, to switch to the Republican Party gave an incorrect figure in some copies for Democrats remaining in the House. It is 204, not 205. (The rest of the seats are held by 229 Republicans and one independent, with one seat vacant.)
