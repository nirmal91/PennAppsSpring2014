To the Editor:
Once again, inbound flights originating outside the United States were canceled (front page, Jan. 2), yet when checking in at Baltimore/Washington International Airport under an orange alert, I was instructed to place my luggage in an unattended pile in the lobby. My companion and I approached the pile with confusion.
After we gazed at it for a couple of minutes, someone from the Transportation Security Administration emerged and confirmed that we were to leave it there. After doing as we were told, I stepped outside and observed that the pile remained unattended, as countless people walked by and others anonymously added to the pile.
I think that we need to remember that the planes that hit the World Trade Center originated in the United States.
