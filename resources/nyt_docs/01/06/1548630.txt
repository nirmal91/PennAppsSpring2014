The state comptroller, Nancy Wyman, has announced that the estimated 2004 state budget deficit has risen to $84.8 million, attributable mainly to lagging revenues from the tax on corporate profits. The deficit on the $13.5 billion fiscal year budget grew by about $33 million in the last month, with about $24 million attributable to declining revenues, Ms. Wyman said in a statement on Friday. The corporation tax has brought in less revenue than was expected, partly because taxpayers are unaware of the increases enacted last year. ''So far, the corporate tax receipts have been substantially lower than estimated,'' Ms. Wyman said. ''If this trend continues,'' she added that ''the total shortfall on the corporation tax could exceed $75 million by the end of the fiscal year'' on June 30.
