New York City will offer 500 events, many of them free, to celebrate winter, said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who announced the program yesterday. The events, to be held in each borough, range from ice carving to snowshoeing to a performance by Bukharan Jewish dancers. Times and places can be found online at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311.
