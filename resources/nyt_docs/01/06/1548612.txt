Gen. Wesley K. Clark said on Monday that Vice President Al Gore invited him to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2000, shortly after the general retired from the military. The invitation came a few days after General Clark received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton. ''I thought, I'm trying to get started in business and this is just unfortunate because it's going to look like it's a payoff,'' making it a subject of possible attacks by the Republican Party, General Clark said. ''As it turned out I did not give that speech. The reason I didn't is that I was just out of the military, the Democratic Party did not know me and I didn't feel it would be helpful to do that.''
