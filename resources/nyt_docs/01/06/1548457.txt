To the Editor:
Re ''Our So-Called Boom,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Dec. 30):
Mr. Krugman tells the tale of two recoveries -- one for the rich, and one for the majority of the population -- behind the Commerce Department figures hailed as harbingers for good times ahead.
The truth is that Americans shopping at the low-priced chains are also finding it difficult to buy food for their children. The administration's own figures show 35 million Americans, including 13 million children, lived in homes that struggled to put food on the table last year, a one-year increase of 1.7 million people.
The growth of hunger and poverty in our nation is the reality behind the headlines of rising corporate profits. A political road map out of this economic divide could begin with policies that support the greatest good for the growing number of Americans with the greatest need. The first stop on the road map should be focused on our hungry children.
