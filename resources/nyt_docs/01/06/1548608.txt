Howard Dean plans to put a 30-second advertisement on television in Iowa starting Tuesday, separating himself from his Democratic opponents by saying he was the only leading candidate who ''stood up to George Bush'' by opposing the war, among other things.
''He'll repeal the Bush tax cuts to provide health insurance for every American, and take on the corporate special interests in Washington,'' the narrator says.
Then Dr. Dean speaks: ''It's not enough to change presidents. We have to change the way Washington works, stand up to the lobbyists and the special interests and make government work for people again.''
