The Interpublic Group of Companies in New York took another step yesterday to help solve its operational problems by selling four money-losing automotive racetracks in Britain. Terms were not disclosed.
The tracks have been a big -- though not the biggest -- drain on Interpublic's profits; another auto-racing unit, which oversees the Formula One British Grand Prix, has had larger losses. Interpublic is also trying to sell or dispose of that unit.
The tracks sold yesterday were acquired by Interpublic for an estimated $120 million and about $60 million of that has been written off as part of the efforts by the new managers to turn around Interpublic, the agency company. The tracks, operating under the Brands Hatch Circuits name, are being sold to MotorSport Vision Ltd., a new company run by a former Formula One driver, Jonathan Palmer, who also owns a British racing company called Bedford Motorsport Ltd.
The Brands Hatch Circuits unit, previously called Octagon Motorsports, will be renamed Silverstone Motorsport. Interpublic is facing payments of as much as $460 million through 2015 related to the Grand Prix contract and operating lease if it is unable to sell or otherwise dispose of that obligation.
Interpublic has previously sold go-kart and motorcycle racing tracks as the new managers seek to exit venue ownership to focus on core advertising and marketing services. The company has previously moved to rectify its problems by settling stockholder lawsuits prompted by unexpected charges to earnings, and through layoffs, merging agencies and paying down debt.
