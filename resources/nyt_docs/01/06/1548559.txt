To the Editor:
Re ''That Parent-Child Conversation Is Becoming Instant, and Online'' (front page, Jan. 3):
Your article about computer instant messaging struck a chord with me, as it has definitely become a useful means through which to communicate with my nieces and nephews out of town.
Along with this came the acquisition of a new skill, ''I.M. speak.'' For instance, in this new language the missive below would require a translation, which follows the instant message:
''Hi how r u? wer xcited bout coming 2 visit 2morrow. Sry if u r gettin bored on vacation. k ttys.''
''Hi, how are you. We're excited about coming to visit tomorrow. Sorry if you're getting bored on vacation. O.K., talk to you soon.''
Proper spelling and grammar appear to be the necessary casualties of improved teenage communication. If we want to understand teenagers' lives, on their terms, it appears that we must also speak their language.
I guess that's kewl.
