To the Editor:
Last year, our 41-year-old son died after a long struggle with cancer (''Facing Up to the Inevitable'').
The doctor assigned to him was on vacation, and our desperate attempts to reach the physician in charge of palliative care were repeatedly rejected. Another doctor told us that when our son raised his hand in a brief wave, it was not an act of communication, but merely a reflex.
How long will it take for the medical establishment to start teaching its students proper end-of-life care?
The memories of our son's death will always be marred by our inability to help him die peacefully. But we do know that he did wave to us, despite the best medical opinion at the time.
