A 23-year-old man who pleaded guilty last month to sodomy and rape involving four women in Manhattan was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 35 years in prison. The man, Tyrone Williams, has a criminal record dating to 1997 that includes burglary and grand larceny convictions. He pleaded guilty on Dec. 8 to two counts of sodomy and two counts of rape, the top charges in an 18-count indictment, an official in the office of Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said. Mr. Williams, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest in May, still faces separate charges in the Bronx related to three attacks against women there. His next court date is Jan. 12.
