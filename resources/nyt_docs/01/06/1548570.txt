To the Editor:
An American official admits that the cancellation of certain inbound flights ''was not in response to United States safety concerns'' but was a tactic designed to coerce a foreign carrier involved in a procedural dispute (front page, Jan. 3). That's just thoroughly irresponsible. The international community expects and deserves utter reliability and seriousness where terrorist threats are concerned.
