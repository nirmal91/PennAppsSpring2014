To the Editor:
Recognizing that the era of reducing big government is over -- partly because ''many of the worst excesses of government have been addressed'' and partly because even a federal government dominated by Republicans shows little appetite for shrinking the public sector -- David Brooks urges the Republican Party to think about reforming government (''Running on Reform,'' column, Jan. 3).
This is hardly a novel idea; Clinton-Gore embraced the concept. But the notion of Republicans making peace with government is new, and politically adept for a party eager to win over moderates and independents.
Just one problem: How can President Bush hope to improve the effectiveness of government after his administration has racked up a trillion-dollar deficit that has impoverished the public realm, leaving it virtually incapable of effecting meaningful change?
