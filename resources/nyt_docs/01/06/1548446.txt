The position of the arm when blood pressure is being checked can make the difference between a reading that leads to treatment and one that does not, a study released yesterday concluded.
Other research has found that many health care workers do not follow guidelines for how to take blood pressure readings.
In the study, which was published as a letter in The Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers from the University of California at San Diego used automated cuffs to take six readings from 100 emergency room patients whose problems did not involve their circulatory systems.
Their blood pressure was measured standing, sitting and lying down; in each position it was measured with the arm straight out from the body and held at the side.
In the new study, the researchers found that the position of the arm had a bigger effect on the readings than the position of the body. When the arm was parallel to the body, readings were higher by as much as 14 millimeters of mercury. The American Heart Association recommends that the arm be flexed at the elbow at the level of the heart. But an author of the new study, Dr. David A. Guss, said that no single position was automatically more accurate: ''The most important thing is to use a consistent position from measurement to measurement.''
