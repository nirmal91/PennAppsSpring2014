The Army is preparing an order that would require about 7,000 troops now in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan to remain on duty through the end of their deployments this spring, even if they could otherwise leave the service before then, an Army personnel officer said Monday.
Once these troops return to their bases, they may also be required to remain in the service for up to 90 days while they complete their formal separation from the Army, said the personnel officer, Col. Elton R. Manske.
Another order, previously announced, already prevents active-duty and reserve troops rotating into Iraq and Kuwait this year from leaving the Army before serving 12 months on the ground, plus a similar 90-day period after they return.
Colonel Manske said the measures were being taken to maintain the cohesion of Army units on duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan as new troops move in. About 110,000 troops, a vast majority from the Army, will be deployed to Iraq and Kuwait by the end of May to replace the approximately 123,000 troops there now. Fresh forces also are scheduled to replace the approximately 11,000 American troops currently in Afghanistan.
The Army, stretched by these deployments, also began a program on Jan. 1 to offer re-enlistment bonuses of up to $10,000 to those serving in Iraq, Kuwait or Afghanistan.
