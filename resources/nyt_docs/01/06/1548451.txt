''The Male Pill: A Biography of a Technology in the Making,'' by Dr. Nelly Oudshoorn, Duke University Press, $21.95.
Other than the advent of Viagra, sexual intervention topics have focused primarily on women: contraceptive pills, in vitro fertilization and hormone replacement therapy, among them.
Indeed, as Dr. Oudshoorn, professor of gender and technology at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, notes, ''the identification of the female body as the quintessential medical object has a long history.''
Her book is about the quest for a male contraceptive and the reason it is still not a reality, even though its feasibility was demonstrated some 30 years ago. Explanations for the delay include male research bias and doubts about whether men or women will even accept such a pill or a contraceptive injection.
In addition, some biologists argue that it is far harder to suppress a ''gigantic factory of sperm production'' than it is to ''knock out the production of one egg per month'' in women. Others say this is not so.
There are more factors, Dr. Oudshoorn says, noting that advocates say such a contraceptive will contribute to gender equality, while feminist opponents say it will pose a threat to women's autonomy. Though the author says there are no easy answers, she notes that male contraceptives ''are not inherently emancipatory, nor intrinsically oppressive.''
''Whatever happens,'' she concludes, ''one thing is certain: male contraceptives have become an inevitable factor in the dynamics of change in the gendered social order.''
