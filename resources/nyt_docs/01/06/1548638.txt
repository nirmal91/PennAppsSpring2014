An article in Weekend on Friday about Civil War films available on video or DVD misspelled the given name of a Confederate general who appears as a character in ''Gettysburg.'' He was Lewis Armistead, not Louis. The article also misstated the release year for ''Virginia City.'' It was 1940, not 1949.
