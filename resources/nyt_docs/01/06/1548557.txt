To the Editor:
David Brooks (column, Jan. 3) wants to give Republicans a new mission in 2004 because reducing government's size can no longer be the party's ''animating principle.''
The G.O.P. doesn't need a new mission. Now that they are back in full power, Republicans are free to resume the agenda that has truly animated the party: to strengthen the employer class and make employees less dependent on government.
The Republican Party knows full well what it wants to accomplish. It just needs to find a way to do it and still get re-elected. Maybe that's all Mr. Brooks's makeover is designed to accomplish.
