To the Editor:
Before inconveniencing international travelers trying to visit relatives for the holidays, Homeland Security should make sure that domestic travel is safe. On the day of the first snowstorm in New York City, my husband and I lost track of each other in Kennedy International Airport. I was able to get all the way to the gates without a ticket or passport. I acknowledge that there was mayhem, but that is exactly what terrorists are looking for.
