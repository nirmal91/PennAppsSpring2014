Letter bombs sent from Bologna, Italy, exploded Monday in the offices of two senior members of the European Parliament -- one British and one German -- but no one was hurt.
At least one other suspicious letter was seized in Brussels, said Alison Suttie, a press officer for the president of the European Parliament.
Officials speculated that the explosions were related to a series of letter bombs sent from Bologna to European officials and organizations late last month. They were sent to Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, and to Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank. Europol, the European Union police agency, and Eurojust, a crime-fighting agency, received nearly identical bombs.
The first one to explode Monday had been sent to Brussels to Hans-Gert Pöttering, the German head of the European People's Party. It caught fire, but no one was hrut.
A second letter bomb was later opened by a staff member in the Manchester office of Gary Titley, the leader of the Labor Party in the European Parliament.
Ms. Suttie said all three letters were postmarked Dec. 22.
A third letter, which failed to explode, was sent to a Spanish deputy of the European People's Party, José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra.
