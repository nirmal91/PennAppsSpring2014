To the Editor:
Re ''More Teenagers Say No to Sex, and Experts Aren't Sure Why'' (Dec. 23): Across the globe, declines in per capita birthrates have been highly correlated to the educational and financial opportunities afforded to women. Young girls in this country are earning greater respect, receiving better opportunities in school, and finding more and more powerful women in intellectual and athletic arenas to admire as role models.
As this trend continues, it is likely to chip away at the tendency for many young women to define their identities through intimate relationships with men and boys.
