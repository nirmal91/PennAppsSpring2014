Patrick L. Meehan, the United States attorney in Philadelphia, announced yesterday that the Justice Department had filed a complaint against Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm, saying it gave improper consulting advice to hospitals, which filed fraudulent Medicare claims based on the advice. As a result, he said, Medicare overpaid nine hospitals a total of $900,000 for laboratory blood tests from 1991 to 1995. In a statement, Ernst &amp; Young said its services for the hospitals were ''fully consistent with professional standards'' and Medicare billing guidelines at the time.
