The Farmer's Daughter, a newly refurbished hotel opposite the popular Farmers' Market, started life as the Farmer's Daughter motel in 1961. In the 70's it spent some time as a Best Western, and now it has been reincarnated under new ownership and management.
Pete Picataggio, who manages the hotel with his wife, Ellen, wanted to create a different environment from the boutique hotels he had sampled while traveling. Those hotels had, he said, ''incredible designs but weren't very comfortable.''
Dean Larkin, an architect, and Delta Wright, an interior designer, working with Ms. Picataggio, gave the 64-room hotel a country feel. The exterior, above, was painted to resemble gingham, and there is an entrance made from old barn wood. The lobby, right, and the rooms are decorated in strong reds and yellows; furnishings include rocking chairs and denim bedspreads. Room rates are $104 to $169 a night.
