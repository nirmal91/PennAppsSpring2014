To the Editor:
Why am I not surprised by Senator John Kerry's victories in New Hampshire (front page, Jan. 28) and Iowa?
In a way, he's always been the front-runner. Even when the others had broad support, it was shallow. Senator Kerry was always in the background -- solid, sensible, the deepest experience.
Many of us supported the enfant terrible Howard Dean, but not necessarily to vote for him. I oppose the war in Iraq, too, but if I were a senator, I would have had to authorize force. The only real choice (thanks to Republicans) was: Bind the president's hands, or write him a blank check.
I like most of the Democratic candidates, but only John Kerry passes all of my tests: platform, experience, personality. And by personality I mean the presence, leadership and maturity to be president of the United States.
