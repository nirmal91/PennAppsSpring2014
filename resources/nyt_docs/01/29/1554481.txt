HAND-HOOKED rugs, a staple of the folk art tradition, are going mainstream, thanks in part to inexpensive imported reproductions of favorite old patterns. Antiques, while available, tend to be small and worn as well as pricey. New designs, especially geometric ones, are well suited to modern interiors, and American workshops make them in custom sizes, large enough to go wall-to-wall or as one-of-a-kind pieces.
1. A 20-by-30-inch rug with an Adam and Eve theme, by Margo White, a rugmaker in Indianapolis, is made of hand-dyed wool and is $700. This design and others by Ms. White are sold at the American Folk Art Museum gift shops, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, and 2 Lincoln Square (66th Street and Columbus Avenue), (212) 595-9533.
2. A vintage 20th-century rug in the Arts and Crafts tradition is 3 by 6 feet; $5,600 at ABC Carpet &amp; Home, 888 Broadway (19th Street), (212) 473-3000.
3. The 6-by-9-foot Sawtooth Border wool rug has variegated red-tone stripes at its center; $358 from Garnet Hill, or www.garnethill.com or (800) 870-3513.
4. Oakleaf and Irish Chain is by Stephen Anderson Designs and is made in his Manhattan workshop. His rugs can be ordered in all sizes and in many shapes, at $135 to $150 a square foot (or starting at about $7,000 for a 6-by-9-foot rug). The studio is at 1071 First Avenue (59th Street), (212) 319-0815.
5. One of a new collection of rugs inspired by early American geometric patterns. These rugs are available in many patterns and in custom sizes to fit rooms, hallways and stairs; they are $55 a square foot.
