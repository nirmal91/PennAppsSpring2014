A new version of the MyDoom virus has appeared, and it tries just as hard as the first one to live up to its name. MyDoom is the fastest-spreading computer virus to date, with some 300,000 infected computers and 160,000 virus-bearing e-mail messages zinging across the Internet every hour, said Craig Schmugar, a virus researcher for Network Associates. He and other virus experts said it will program infected computers to start an online attack on Sunday against SCO Group, which sells the Unix operating system. The new version will begin a similar attack against Microsoft, and blocks access to antivirus online sites that could help users protect against the malicious software, as well as some online advertising sites. The goal of the programmer behind the worms, said Mr. Schmugar, appears to be creating a large population of machines that can be controlled remotely for such purposes as sending spam and diverting online advertising traffic. The new version contains a comment within its lines of code, ''andy: I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry.''
