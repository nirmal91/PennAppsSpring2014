To the Editor:
My removal as chairwoman of a committee 10 years ago has been noted in two recent news articles (Jan. 22 and 23) about committee assignments in the City Council.
For my grandchildren's sake, I would like the record to show that I was removed as chairwoman of the Contracts Committee because I voted against the first budget that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani submitted to the Council while the Democratic speaker, Peter F. Vallone, supported the Republican budget. The next year, I am happy to report, he had the good sense to oppose the proposed budget Mr. Giuliani submitted, so we all voted no!
All this demonstrates some of the problems members of legislative bodies have trying to balance their constituents' sentiments, and their own principles, with the will of the leadership.
Frankly, I've always been proud of losing that chairwoman assignment.
