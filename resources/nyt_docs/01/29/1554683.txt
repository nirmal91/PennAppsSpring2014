The dean of Fordham College at Rose Hill, the original undergraduate division of Fordham University in the Bronx, has been named president of Fairfield University. The dean, the Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, 56, an associate professor of history, will succeed the Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley on July 1. Father von Arx, left, a graduate of Princeton and Yale Universities and a scholar of 19th-century British history, has worked at Fordham since 1998. Father Kelley, 74, who was university president for 25 years, announced in October that he would retire at the end of this academic year.
