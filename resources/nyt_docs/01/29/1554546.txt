Anyone who has huddled over the speaker of a telephone for a conference call or strained to hear a colleague's presentation over the tinny speakers of a laptop computer is likely to have concluded that there must be a better way.
S3i Sound, an audio technologies company in Ames, Iowa, says there is. Its Omnivox transforms the conference table or desk itself into a speaker. The device, which is about the size and shape of a hockey puck and plugs into a standard audio-out jack, transfers audio signals into vibrations that radiate evenly throughout solid surfaces to be heard loud and clear as sound.
The Omnivox ($300 at www.S3iSound.com and $250 at CompUSA) works on wood or glass without harming the surface, its engineers say.
The Omnivox requires no additional software and is compatible with Windows and Mac computers. It uses a material called Terfenol-D, an alloy developed by the United States military for use in sonar systems.
The Omnivox mobile sound system includes a power transformer, electrical adapters for international use and a small amplifier. Conference calls may be no more stimulating than ever, but at least you'll be able to hear what they're saying at the other end.
