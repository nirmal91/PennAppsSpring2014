The government's former peace negotiator, Camilo Gómez, told a radio station that the former president, Andrés Pastrana, twice asked President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela to meet with guerrilla envoys. His disclosures came a day after Mr. Chávez, left, told reporters in Venezuela that he had met with leftist guerrillas at the request of Colombia's government. Mr. Chávez's comments touched off a flurry of criticism from foes who have long claimed that the Venezuelan leader supports the Marxist rebels. Mr. Chávez said the meetings were intended to help Colombia's troubled peace talks and to obtain the release of hostages.
