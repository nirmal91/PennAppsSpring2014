Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman has made dozens of telephone calls to teams since learning about 10 days ago that third baseman Aaron Boone seriously injured his left knee playing pickup basketball. But soon after Cashman finishes dialing, he has repeatedly been greeted with frustrating news.
''There's no progress,'' he said. ''There's nothing to make progress on. There are no players available.''
The Yankees have Enrique Wilson, Miguel Cairo, Erick Almonte and Tyler Houston, a nonroster invitee who has agreed to a minor league contract, as their hardly-imposing candidates to replace Boone. One player whose absence is notable in the third-base discussion is Drew Henson, the 23-year-old quarterback turned third baseman who appears headed back to football.
''The one thing that I can say is Casey has informed me that Drew is considering playing football, more so now than he has in the past,'' said Cashman, referring to Casey Close, Henson's agent.
As for Boone, he is forbidden from playing basketball as part of his $5.75 million guaranteed contract. As such, the Yankees could release him and be responsible for only 30 days' pay.
''If you want to give my agent a call, they're still trying to figure this whole thing out and what it all means,'' Boone said yesterday in a brief telephone interview.
