The Westchester-Loyola Village Branch Library, near the Los Angeles International Airport, is one of 32 new Los Angeles libraries. Its architect is Aleks Istanbullu of Santa Monica, Calif. The library, above, has a painted stucco exterior and is set in a newly created park. Inside, Mr. Istanbullu designed a 120-foot-long by 24-foot-high wood-paneled public area inspired, he said, by the Ste.-Genevi√®ve library in Paris. There are silk-screened images of local people by Jill D'Angenica on the walls and ceiling.
The checkout desk, right, has a stainless steel counter and canopy. Reading areas are in adjacent, more intimate spaces; 7114 West Manchester Avenue; (310) 348-1083.
