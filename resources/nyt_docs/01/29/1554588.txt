To the Editor:
Re ''Kerry Beats Dean in New Hampshire for a 2nd Victory'' (front page, Jan. 28):
The message is clear. American voters told the world that the war on Iraq is no longer an issue. They have bought the Bush administration line that Howard Dean is not electable and would be easily defeated by George W. Bush.
They have chosen an insider who supported the war on Iraq rather than the one who courageously denounced it and brought a message of hope.
John Kerry did not win; George W. Bush did, by succeeding with his politics of fear. The illegitimate war on Iraq should be the No. 1 issue for the presidential election.
