An article on Jan. 12 about the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park in White Springs, Fla., included an erroneous figure supplied by the center for its staff size. It has 15 members, not 17. The article also misstated the timing of budget cuts cited by a state parks specialist, Martha Nelson. They occurred before the administration of Gov. Jeb Bush, as well as during his tenure.
