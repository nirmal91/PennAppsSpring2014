Firefighters from four municipalities battled a six-alarm fire that tore through a sprawling warehouse complex on the Passaic River last night, fire officials said. The fire began just before 10 p.m. in the complex, which is on Jacobus Avenue. The flames could be seen for miles, witnesses reported. By 1 a.m. firefighters had removed several propane tanks from the area and had summoned fire boats, officials said.
