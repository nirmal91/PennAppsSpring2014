A major credit rating agency announced yesterday that New York City is on pace to resolve ''one of the most serious fiscal challenges it has faced in decades.''
The agency, Moody's Investors Service, revised its ratings outlook on the city's bonds to stable, from negative. It said in a statement that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had balanced the city's books through a combination of tax increases, spending restraint and borrowing. It called his newest budget plan ''reasonable and achievable.''
The agency said that the city had reduced its deficits ''to manageable levels, more proportionately in line with pre-Sept. 11 and pre-recession amounts.''
The Bloomberg administration was pleased with the announcement, which it saw as evidence of Mayor Bloomberg's success in guiding the city through two consecutive years of multibillion-dollar budget deficits.
''Moody's upgrading of New York's outlook demonstrates that Mayor Bloomberg is successfully managing the city's budget through the worst fiscal crisis in a generation,'' said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor. ''However, he still faces considerable financial challenges and fiscal prudence is still necessary.''
Two other credit ratings agencies have already upgraded their ratings outlooks on the city's bonds. Moody's rates the city's bonds A2, a midrange rating. The ratings are important to the city because they help determine how much interest it will have to pay on the money it borrows.
