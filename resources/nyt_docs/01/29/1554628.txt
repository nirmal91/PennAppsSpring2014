Time is running out for a settlement between the European Commission and Microsoft in the long-running antitrust case, said Mario Monti, left, the European commissioner for competition. ''We are not against a settlement, if that is clearly in consumers' interests, but the time is running out,'' he said yesterday. A draft ruling that brands Microsoft an abusive monopolist is being circulated internally within the commission, before it is shown to national competition regulators for comments next month. A final decision is expected in March or April.
