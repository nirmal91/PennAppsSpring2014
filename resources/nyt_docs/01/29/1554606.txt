India announced a series of measures that would relax import duties and restrictions for several sectors of the economy in an attempt to increase exports. The government said it would eliminate duties on professional equipment for the services industry and on fuel for the manufacturing industry. Restrictions on gold and silver imports by jewelers and by bullion traders were also eased. The government hopes the measures help it meet a goal of a 12 percent increase in exports this year.
