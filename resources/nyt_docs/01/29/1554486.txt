Two picture credits with a front-page article in this section on Jan. 15 about Ypenburg, a suburban development in the Netherlands, misstated the photographer's surname. He is Marco Hillen, not Gillen.
A picture with the continuation of the article, showing the interior courtyard of an apartment building, carried an erroneous credit. The photographer was Mr. Hillen.
