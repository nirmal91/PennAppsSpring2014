Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's seemingly rejuvenated prime minister, said all the observers who spied a taut difference around his eyes were indeed noticing a strategic nip. But Mr. Berlusconi, in remarks at a party in Rome for Italian fashion designers, insisted that his recent adventures in elective surgery did not include any other parts of his face or body, according to The Associated Press. An Italian newsweekly has reported that Mr. Belusconi, 67, received a more extreme makeover. His aides have declined to comment, but they deny speculation that his recent absence from public view was because of illness.
