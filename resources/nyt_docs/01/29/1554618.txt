One person was killed and several others injured in a clash between the police, supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and antigovernment marchers near the American Consulate in Port-au-Prince. Demonstrators had gathered outside the consulate, where they burned a coffin and called for the ouster of Mr. Aristide. As the demonstrators were leaving, rock-throwing Aristide supporters confronted them. The police fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Hospital officials said the man who was killed died when he was struck in the chest by a tear-gas canister. A spokeswoman for the consulate said the office closed because of the unrest but that officials hoped to re-open it today.
