British Airways said it would cut Â£300 million ($546.7 million) from its budget for its employees in the next two years, by encouraging unpaid leave, part-time work, early retirement and voluntary severance. Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, British Airways has announced 13,000 job cuts. ''The last two years have been about survival; now we want to be in a position to prosper,'' the chief executive, Rod Eddington, said in a statement explaining the cuts.
