After a remarkably diverse show-business career, the 63-year-old singer and songwriter Dobie Gray, left, at last has his first No. 1 single with a remake of his classic, bittersweet 1973 pop hit ''Drift Away.'' The new version, which returned to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard adult contemporary chart in the Jan. 31 issue and has lingered on the chart for an astonishing 46 weeks, is a duet teaming Mr. Gray with Uncle Kracker, the longtime Kid Rock sideman. It has been 39 years since Mr. Gray, born Lawrence Darrow Brown in Texas and nicknamed after the 1960's television character Dobie Gillis, first reached the pop Top 20 with the soulful '' 'In' Crowd.'' Since then he has had many record deals with mixed success; moved to Los Angeles to be a movie star (acting instead in the theatrical production of ''Hair''); relocated to Nashville in 1978 to become a country singer and songwriter, and wrote with George Reneau a No. 1 country hit for John Conlee (''Got My Heart Set On You,'' 1986). But like most black artists (except Charley Pride and briefly Ray Charles), Mr. Gray ran into a brick wall with Nashville executives and country radio programmers. In a music world becoming ever more diverse, Mr. Gray sees country's de facto whites-only approach as severely outdated. ''It kills the industry,'' he said in an interview. ''I think that's why the country market is kind of in limbo. It needs a new infusion. I'm not saying it needs to be a black artist, but it needs something new.''
