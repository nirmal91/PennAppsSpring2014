Wawa, the convenience store chain in Wawa, Pa., has named the Richards Group in Dallas as agency of record on its account, with billings estimated at $7 million to $10 million.
The decision consolidates the creative duties on the account, which had been handled by Ritter in King of Prussia, Pa., and the media duties, which had been handled by MayoSeitz Media in Blue Bell, Pa. The decision came after a three-month review narrowed the field to Richards, which formerly worked for the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores, and three other finalists: MayoSeitz, Eisner Communications in Baltimore and Marc USA in Pittsburgh. The review was managed by Select Resources International in Santa Monica, Calif.
