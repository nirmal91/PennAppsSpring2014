A judge has voided two contracts between the City Department of Education and private building maintenance companies that serve more than 200 public schools, dealing a setback to the city's effort to expand school privatization. In a lawsuit filed by the school custodians' union, Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, the city was accused of violating competitive bidding practices in awarding contracts worth $60 million to two companies, Johnson Controls and Temco Service Industries, for cleaning and maintenance work in 228 schools. In a ruling this week, Justice Faviola Soto of State Supreme Court in Manhattan declared the contracts void and said the city had violated both state and city competitive-bidding laws. City education officials said they planned to appeal.
