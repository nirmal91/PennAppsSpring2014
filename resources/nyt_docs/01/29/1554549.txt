Tracking the distance you jog can be a dubious and bothersome task. Most pedometers require a user to estimate the length of his or her stride, something that is difficult to do with precision. But with the Forerunner 201, a gadget from Garmin that straps onto your wrist, you can shelve the pedometer and bring home better workout records.
The device, which is available online and at retailers like Wal-Mart for about $150, uses the Global Positioning System to measure pace, location and distance covered. It tracks your latitude, longitude and altitude, so that when you have reached your destination, it knows exactly how far and how fast you ran, as well as the gradients of the slopes you climbed. It includes a self-scrolling map, a ''calories burned'' function, and an automated Virtual Partner that, among other things, can alert you if you fall behind the pace you intend to maintain.
The Forerunner can store up to two years' worth of data, allowing you to analyze your long-term progress. But its most intriguing feature may be its computer compatibility. The device comes with a charger that includes a serial interface, and a Garmin spokesman said that in coming days the company would begin offering free software at www.garmin.com that would allow users to download workout histories to computers and display progress graphs.
More and better data may help improve a jogger's fitness regimen. But perhaps even better, solid evidence of one's progress may put friendly competitors' doubts to rest.
