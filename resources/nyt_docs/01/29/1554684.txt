Jimmy Raye, who joined the Jets' offensive staff in 2002, was hired by the Oakland Raiders yesterday as their offensive coordinator and assistant head coach.
Raye was the Jets' senior offensive assistant and was charged with helping to smooth game-day communications between the offensive coordinator, Paul Hackett, and the sideline. He was also a mentor for the offensive line coach, Doug Marrone, who had not coached in the N.F.L. before joining the Jets.
Raye had been offensive coordinator for five other teams and has a longstanding relationship with the Raiders' new head coach, Norv Turner. Raye replaces Marc Trestman, who became the Dolphins' assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach when Turner left Miami.
