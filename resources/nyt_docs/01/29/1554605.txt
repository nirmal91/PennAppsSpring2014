Standard &amp; Poor's raised the short-term rating on Shinsei Bank to A-2 from A-3, citing the bank's strong asset quality and funding. S.&amp;P. left Shinsei's long-term rating unchanged at BBB. Shinsei, the first foreign-owned lender in Japan, will hold a public share offering on Feb. 19. In preparation for the offering, the bank reduced its nonperforming loans by 43 percent in the last nine months of 2003 and expected to earn 65 billion yen ($613 million) in the fiscal year ending this March.
