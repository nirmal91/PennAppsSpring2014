The financier Carl Icahn, through two of his charitable foundations, will donate $10 million toward a new track and field stadium at Randalls Island Park. The gift is the largest ever from a donor to a New York City park other than Central Park. The $40 million project is also financed by $20 million in public funds and $10 million in other private donations. It is expected to be complete in the fall of this year.
