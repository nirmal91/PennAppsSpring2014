To the Editor:
In ''In Next Round, No Certainties'' (news analysis, front page, Jan. 28), you write that surveys of voters leaving the polls suggested that New Hampshire voters, like the voters in Iowa, chose John Kerry ''more for his electability than for his compatibility.''
''Electability'' is a subjective concept that was injected into the primaries, perhaps by the ''Stop Dean'' contingent of the Democratic Party, and promoted by the media.
Voters are switching from the candidate they prefer, usually Howard Dean, to another candidate, mostly John Kerry, based on what they think general-election voters will prefer.
No wonder Democrats are losing elections. Instead of trusting our own instincts, too many of us are basing our votes on mind-reading.
