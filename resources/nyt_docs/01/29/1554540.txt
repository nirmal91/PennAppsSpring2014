Two new cameras announced by Nikon this week share a price ($1,000) and a target market (affluent amateur photographers). But the similarities end there.
The Nikon Coolpix 8700 is a slightly oversize point-and-shoot camera. Like many more expensive digital cameras for amateurs, it has an electronic viewfinder for composing. Its image-sensor resolution of eight megapixels is much higher than that of many other cameras.
The Coolpix 8700, to be in stores by late February, introduces a feature for creating panoramic photos. Its digital viewfinder creates a ghost image showing part of the previous frame to help users align their shots.
The Nikon D70 is a single lens reflex camera that accepts most lenses produced by the company (although some of the camera's features will not work with older lenses).
The metal body of the D100, which previously was Nikon's least expensive interchangeable-lens camera, has been replaced with plastic in the D70, which has a 6.1-megapixel charge-coupled device, or C.C.D., image sensor.
When the D70 begins shipping this spring, Nikon will also offer a zoom lens designed specifically for the camera. Selling for $300 when purchased with the D70, it will offer a range of focal lengths comparable to a 27- to 105-millimeter lens on a 35-millimeter film camera.
The D70's most direct competitor, the Canon Digital Rebel, includes a zoom lens for the price of the Nikon camera body alone. Nikon is hoping that some additional features in the D70, like sophisticated program modes that alter electronic as well as photographic settings, will offset the cost difference.
