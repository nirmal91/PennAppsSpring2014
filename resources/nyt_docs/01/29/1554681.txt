A Manhattan woman charged with stealing money from relief agencies after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack pleaded guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court and is expected to be sentenced to 52 weekends in prison, in addition to having to pay fines and restitution. The woman, Beatrice Kaufman, 68, originally said she had been forced to evacuate her apartment and had lost earnings because of the destruction of the World Trade Center. But officials said Ms. Kaufman, who ran an employment agency for lawyers, was at her summer house on Long Island during the attack.
