In addition to being a tugboat restorer, a race-car driver, a yoga instructor and the founder of McCabe's Guitar Shop in Los Angeles, Gerald McCabe, now 77, was a furniture designer in the 1950's and 60's. He provided chairs and tables for Case Study House architects like Pierre Koenig and Craig Ellwood. Now Cameron Slocum, a painter and a vintage furniture dealer in Los Angeles, is reproducing as many as 40 pieces by the man he refers to as ''the most underrated designer in L.A. Modernism.'' Mr. McCabe's 1956 Triangle table, below, is made of glass and polished tubular chrome and was designed for Koenig's Case Study House 21. The reproduction will cost about $2,200.
