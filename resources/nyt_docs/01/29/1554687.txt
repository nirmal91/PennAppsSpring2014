Based on his experience last year, Todd Zeile knew he did not want to return to the Yankees, and he still feels that way now, even though their third-base job has opened unexpectedly.
Zeile said he saw an opportunity for more than just playing time with the Mets, and recruited as much for his ability in the clubhouse as on the field, Zeile officially returned to the team yesterday.
Zeile's contract guarantees him $1 million and another potential $500,000 in performance bonuses. The Mets are not done adding role players, and they plan to announce the signing of outfielder Shane Spencer, another former Yankee, later this week.
Zeile's job will be as a reserve at third base, or at first when neither Jason Phillips nor Mike Piazza is playing there. Zeile thought he could also be a sounding board for Piazza as Piazza navigates his way into a part-time role as a first baseman.
''It's really up to him,'' Zeile said of Piazza. ''A lot of it depends on how good he wants to try to be at first base.''
Of his time with the Yankees, Zeile said, ''I think some of the things that happen over there are different than any other organization in baseball.''
