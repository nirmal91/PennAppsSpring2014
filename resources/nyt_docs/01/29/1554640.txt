The California Lottery Commission has named five finalists in the latest review for its account, with a four-year contract and total billings estimated at $100 million. The review is the third in less than two years, after the results of previous reviews were nullified when some participants protested.
The finalists are: the incumbent agency of the last five years, the Los Angeles office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group; the BBDO West division of BBDO Worldwide in Los Angeles and San Francisco, owned by the Omnicom Group; a team of the Los Angeles office of DDB Worldwide, Alcone Marketing in Irvine, Calif., and the Los Angeles office of OMD, all Omnicom siblings; Dailey &amp; Associates in West Hollywood, Calif., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies; and Ground Zero in Marina del Rey, Calif. DDB Los Angeles had won one of the previous, nullified reviews.
Three agencies and agency teams were eliminated from the review. Two are Interpublic agencies whose contracts had been nullified previously: the San Francisco office of Foote Cone &amp; Belding and the Los Angeles office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. The team eliminated was Triple Play, made up of the Los Angeles office of Horizon Media, Runyon Saltzman &amp; Einhorn in Sacramento and the Beverly Hills office of Wong Doody.
Final presentations are scheduled for February and a decision is expected by early March.
