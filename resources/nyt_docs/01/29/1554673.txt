The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit, contending that the East Kentucky Power Cooperative did not comply with a clean-air rule that typically requires coal-burning power plants to make pollution-control upgrades after major modernization projects. In December an appeals court suspended a new Environmental Protection Agency directive narrowing the government's ability to file such suits. The E.P.A. has said it will continue to bring lawsuits under the older, more stringent regulations until the legal battle is finished.
