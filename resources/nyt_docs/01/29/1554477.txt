The French-American artist Niki de Saint Phalle (bottom left) began building a sculpture garden in Escondido, Calif., in 1999 as a gift to the children of the city. Ms. de Saint Phalle died in 2002, at the age of 71; the garden, called Queen Califia's Magical Circle, opened last month. It honors Queen Califia, the fictional black queen of the Amazon whose name the Spaniards borrowed for the land they called California. The garden contains a 400-foot-long ''snake wall'' (bottom right) surrounding a maze, totems (top left) and the throne of the Eagle with Queen Califia perched on top (top right). Susan Pollack, the public art consultant for Escondido, said Ms. de Saint Phalle wanted to celebrate the cultural diversity of California.
Ms. de Saint Phalle, who moved to La Jolla, Calif., in 1994 after a long career in Europe, worked with craftsmen to make the sculptures, constructed of steel, polystyrene and fiberglass, and covered in mosaics of colored glass, mirror, tumbled stones, ceramic tile and glass tile. Queen Califia's Magical Circle is in the Iris Sankey Arboretum in Kit Carson Park in Escondido, 30 miles north of San Diego. It is free and open daily; (760) 839-4691. A retrospective called ''Niki de Saint Phalle Remembered'' is at the Mingei International Museum's North County Satellite, 155 West Grand Avenue, Escondido, through May; (760) 735-3355.
