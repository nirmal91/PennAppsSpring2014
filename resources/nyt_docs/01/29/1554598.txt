To the Editor:
Re ''A Stadium Too Far'' (editorial, Jan. 26):
I vehemently object to the construction of a West Side stadium.
As a 30-year resident of the theater district, I feel that the congestion and rudeness already thrust upon residents would only increase, making the neighborhood unlivable.
If Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is really concerned with quality-of-life and noise issues, as he has led us all to believe, then he should reconsider this plan. The issue is obvious and needs no further explanation.
