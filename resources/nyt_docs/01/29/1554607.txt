The European Commission scolded France for not making enough effort to reduce its budget deficit. The commission said that the French government's budgetary plans lacked ambition, and it warned that France is set to break the deficit ceiling, intended to protect the euro, for the next three years. In reports on individual countries, the commission said Britain, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands also risk breaching the deficit ceiling, which is 3 percent of the gross domestic product.
