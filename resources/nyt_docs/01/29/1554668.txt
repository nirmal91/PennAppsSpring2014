No photography will be permitted in the trial of Terry L. Nichols, a state judge ruled. The state is seeking the death penalty against Mr. Nichols, who is charged with 161 counts of murder in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Mr. Nichols, 48, whose trial begins March 1, is serving a life sentence for his conviction on federal charges. A second defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, was executed in 2001.
