To the Editor:
Re ''Defrosting the Primaries'' (editorial, Jan. 28):
Your suggestion that the Rev. Al Sharpton and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich be excluded from future debates would do a disservice to Democratic voters and the country.
Although they may not be electable candidates, both Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Kucinich serve a critical function in speaking out on issues that are too rarely addressed by an increasingly cautious and self-censoring Democratic Party and news media.
The public needs Mr. Kucinich to focus attention on the illegitimacy of the Iraq war, and Mr. Sharpton to keep the debate focused on race and the underclass, not just the middle class that most Democrats feel safer talking about.
Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Sharpton raise public awareness of these issues and force the other candidates to deal with them. Democratic elections are promoted by keeping the debates broad and open.
