Brazilian farmers have agreed to pay royalties to the Monsanto Company for use of its genetically engineered soybean seeds. Monsanto said it had reached a preliminary agreement with farm associations in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, the only state where genetically modified soy is widely grown. The farmers' associations said they were still working out final details, but in principle agreed to pay royalties. The deal foresees royalties of 20 reais ($7) per metric ton for the 2004 and 2005 harvests. For crops just harvested, the charge would be as low as 10 reais ($3.50) a metric ton, Monsanto said. For years, the company complained that farmers in the state were using seeds developed with its Roundup Ready technology without paying royalties. The seeds were initially smuggled from Argentina.
