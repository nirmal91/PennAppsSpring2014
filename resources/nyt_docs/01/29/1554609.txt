The European competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said after an initial examination, that Italy's proposed new insolvency law for large companies facing bankruptcy, like the dairy group Parmalat, did not pose any problems under unionwide government aid laws. The new law, known as the Marzano Decree, allows for quicker procedures for adopting a restructuring plan of any Italian company with more than 1,000 employees and debt of more than 1 billion euros. He said he would re-examine the law once it had been passed by the Italian Parliament.
