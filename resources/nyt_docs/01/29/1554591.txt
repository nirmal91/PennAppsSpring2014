To the Editor:
Re ''Defrosting the Primaries'' (editorial, Jan. 28):
I strongly agree with your assessment that John Kerry has yet to be fully tested. Howard Dean has taken every punch that the media and his rivals can throw at him, whereas Senator Kerry's legislative record has largely been ignored.
While the argument for Dr. Dean's candidacy comes from his record of providing health care and balancing budgets in Vermont, Senator Kerry seems to be riding primarily on his Vietnam War record.
Democrats would do well to take a careful look at his time in Congress before they decide that he is the ''electable'' candidate.
