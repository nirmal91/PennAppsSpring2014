To the Editor:
Re ''A Stadium Too Far'' (editorial, Jan. 26):
The Hudson Yards plan envisioned for the West Side of Manhattan is the single best financial investment that New York City can make in its future.
The bold plan would expand the Javits Convention Center; rezone the area to encourage development; expand the No. 7 subway line to provide access; and create 20 new acres of open space.
The area will generate almost $2 billion in additional taxes each year by 2025 and more than 70,000 jobs.
We cannot afford to develop these types of projects without significant private investment, and thus cannot ignore the New York Jets' willingness to invest $800 million in this project.
Yes, the public sector will finance the decking over of the rail yards and the roof, but we must make this investment to allow for an exponentially greater number of convention uses.
The economic impact of these events will more than cover the cost of the original investment.
Redeveloping the Hudson Yards will secure our future; we must have the foresight to invest in it.
