To the Editor:
In ''Defrosting the Primaries'' (editorial, Jan. 28), you describe a Howard Dean who is ''learning from his mistakes, and improving,'' and ''finding at least a tentative balance between a flat policy speech and an angry harangue.''
But something else is missing: While he remains the most compelling speaker in the race, he has not improved as much as Senators John Kerry or John Edwards, apparently because Dr. Dean doesn't listen as well.
In particular, Senator Edwards has refined his message so that it is down to two words, ''two Americas.''
Dr. Dean has not yet moved from argument to vision or shown that he understands that the first arouses and the second lifts.
If and when he does, he will give people a reason for sticking with him.
