Parmalat's Brazilian dairy unit filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, buckling under the effects of the accounting scandal at its Italian parent and legal actions in Brazilian courts.
Parmalat Brasil Indústria de Alimentos filed in a São Paulo court for concordata -- the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States -- saying that its operations had been ''seriously contaminated'' by the scandal.
While the Brazilian dairy unit owes some $160 million to local banks, the total debt of Parmalat's other holding companies in Brazil could reach $1.8 billion, bankers said.
At least four suppliers had been demanding that the Brazilian unit be declared bankrupt, but the chief executive, Ricardo Gonçalves, had fought to keep the company running, despite dwindling cash flow, no fresh bank credit and a growing number of lawsuits that have effectively paralyzed operations.
Executives at the company, which accounts for 10 percent of Parmalat's global revenue and employs a sixth of the overall company's 30,000 workers worldwide, said that they were forced to file for bankruptcy after a showdown with Banco do Brasil, Brazil's largest bank, which is owned by the government.
Banco do Brasil seized $5 million the company had deposited to pay suppliers, saying it was keeping the cash against Parmalat's outstanding loans.
The bank then won a court order last week to seize stocks of dairy products and other assets at a Parmalat factory in São Paulo State.
The unit's possible role in the collapse of Parmalat, the dairy and food giant, is being investigated by Brazil's Congress and the federal police.
