Four members of the spiritual movement Falun Gong filed a complaint in a Paris court against the Chinese culture minister, Sun Jiazheng, who is visiting France with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. The members charge that Mr. Sun is responsible for torture they say they suffered at the hands of the Chinese police. China has banned the movement and has used harsh measures to suppress its spread on the mainland. But it is unlikely that the complaint will result in any action. Mr. Sun is scheduled to leave France today.
