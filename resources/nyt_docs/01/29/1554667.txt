It was not exactly the message City Hall was trying to put out yesterday.
Minutes after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg finished telling reporters that he was annoyed that the city had underreported the number of summonses it wrote last year, and maintained for the umpteenth time that there was no ticket blitz under his watch, his sanitation commissioner, John Doherty, began briefing the press on the snowstorm.
''Tomorrow we'll be out there with the summons books, no doubt about it,'' Mr. Doherty said, promising to crack down on people who fail to shovel their sidewalks. ''And we're going to be writing summonses, because there are those people who, in my mind, just don't give a darn about their neighbors.''
As the cameras rolled and aides to the mayor smiled nervously, Mr. Bloomberg put in his two cents: ''Fortunately, those people are few and far between.''
Mayor Bloomberg said he was ''annoyed, as was everybody else,'' when he learned that the Police Department had underreported the number of quality-of-life summonses -- including tickets for noise and graffiti -- that it issued last year by more than 100,000.
The department originally reported that it wrote 404,088 such summonses, but announced this week that it had actually written 532,817.
The number is important because the Bloomberg administration was under fire last spring when union leaders, elected officials and news accounts accused it of engineering a ''ticket blitz.'' The administration cited figures showing that it was actually issuing fewer tickets. While that still appears to be true in some areas, like parking tickets, the new figures show that the number of quality-of-life summonses increased.
Mayor Bloomberg said that the underreporting was an honest mistake. ''Nobody's trying to hide anything,'' he said.
