To the Editor:
Re ''Kerry Beats Dean in New Hampshire for a 2nd Victory'' (front page, Jan. 28):
A protracted campaign, including Howard Dean and John Edwards, would help the Democratic Party and its current leader, John Kerry.
If the candidates maintain a civil debate, there is real opportunity for John Kerry in the general election.
Dr. Dean's strength is in detailing why George W. Bush has failed the electorate. But Dr. Dean's weakness is his inability to convince voters that he is the Bush alternative. He validates a negative and connects with those with similar feelings.
John Edwards is a brilliant orator who presents a hopeful, youthful exuberance that is also an interesting Bush alternative. But his lack of experience and, perhaps, his lack of electability are his weaknesses.
John Kerry, with his résumé, gravitas and electability, is a perfect alternative and would be a formidable candidate in the general election.
A protracted campaign would allow Dr. Dean and Senator Edwards to express effective alternatives to a national audience and provide Senator Kerry with a modicum of cover.
This debate is driving a heavy turnout. And heavy turnout is not a positive sign for George W. Bush.
