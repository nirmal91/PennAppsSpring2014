The cabinet approved a draft law banning the wearing of religious symbols in public schools, paving the way for its consideration by the National Assembly on Tuesday. President Jacques Chirac and his center-right government have said the law, which would ban Muslim head scarves, Jewish skullcaps, large Christian crosses and perhaps other symbols from school premises, is needed to preserve the secular nature of the French state. But it is widely seen as a move to stanch the rise of militant Islam among the country's large Muslim population. ''The government bill clearly reaffirms the neutrality of public schools,'' Mr. Chirac told the cabinet, according to a spokesman. ''It does not aim to ban religious symbols in everyday life.''
