A Bronx man has been arrested in connection with two unrelated killings in the last two years, including that of a young woman who was found burned to death in a Brooklyn parking lot in May, police officials said yesterday. The man, Rafael Cajigas, 33, was charged with two counts of second-degree murder on Tuesday in the deaths of Taisha Camacho, 19, who the police said was his girlfriend, and Omar Pena, 21, an acquaintance who the police said Mr. Cajigas intentionally ran over with an S.U.V. on a Bronx street in February 2002. In both cases, the police said, Mr. Cajigas had a prior dispute with the victims. The police said they believed that Mr. Cajigas strangled Ms. Camacho in the Brooklyn apartment they shared at the time, then set her body on fire in a parking lot in Sunset Park. In the hit-and-run case, Mr. Pena and another man, Luis Turnbull, 28, were struck while walking on Westchester Avenue. Mr. Turnbull survived.
