To the Editor:
''A Stadium Too Far'' (editorial, Jan. 26) hit the nail on the head. It was time that New York City's misguided, expensive plan for the West Side of Manhattan was critically examined by the news media.
Manhattan Community Board 4 shares many of your concerns, including the wasteful expenditure of tax funds.
A stadium is the wrong economic development tool for Manhattan's West Side and a waste of a prime development site.
The rail yards should be used for new high-density office and/or residential buildings, hotels, community uses, public open space and a southward expansion of the Javits Convention Center. Mass transit could be provided by a subway spur running west to 11th Avenue from the regional transportation hub at Penn Station. The spur could be linked to an extension of the No. 7 subway line as future development allows.
