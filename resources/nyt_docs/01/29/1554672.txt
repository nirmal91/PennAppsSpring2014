Three brothers were indicted by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges of taking women to the Atlanta area from Mexico and forcing them into prostitution. Prosecutors say several women, the youngest 16 years old, were forced through violence and psychological coercion to have sex with numerous men each night. The brothers, Juan Reyes Rojas, 24, Jose Reyes Rojas, 26, and Raul Reyes Rojas, whose age was unknown, face more than 30 years in prison if they are convicted, the United States attorney's office said.
