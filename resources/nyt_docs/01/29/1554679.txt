A young woman was robbed and sexually assaulted on the Upper East Side early yesterday, the police said. The 18-year-old woman, whom the police did not identify, was entering her apartment building at 4:30 a.m., when a man approached her with his hand in his pocket and told her that he had a gun. The man forced the woman to a nearby grocery store, where she withdrew $100 from an automatic teller machine. He took the money and then forced her back to her building, where he attacked her, the police said. The police said the attacker was between 25 and 30 years old.
