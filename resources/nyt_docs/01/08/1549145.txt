An administrative law judge has said that a Department of Correction official charged with trying to steal a Salvador Dalí drawing from Rikers Island had engaged in ''corrupt activities'' and recommended that he be fired. In her report, Judge Rosemarie Maldonado recommended firing the official, Benny Nuzzo, left, not for any role he may have had in the theft but because of other misconduct, including falsifying jailhouse log books, taking home jail property without permission, and lying to investigators. Mr. Nuzzo, who has 19 years in the Correction Department, is an assistant deputy warden. His lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said he planned to contest the judge's recommendation and, if necessary, appeal a decision to fire Mr. Nuzzo in State Supreme Court. Mr. Nuzzo is to appear in court on a Dalí larceny charge next week.
