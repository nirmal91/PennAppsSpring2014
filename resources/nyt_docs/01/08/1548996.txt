The Lightglove, a computer controller that uses light to create virtual buttons and control the cursor, makes the hand more powerful than ever before. It is also a boon to computer users who cannot manipulate a conventional keyboard or mouse.
Worn on the wrist, the controller allows you to use your hand as a wireless mouse, virtual typist or remote control. It scans the underside of your hand to detect physical motion, then radios that information to a base station plugged into a computer's U.S.B. port.
Bruce Howard, an electrical engineer in Catharpin, Va., designed the Lightglove to help his mother, a graphic artist who developed carpal tunnel syndrome.
''Her case was severe,'' Mr. Howard said. ''I knew there had to be a better way. So I developed the Lightglove to act as a virtual mouse that adjusts to the size and shape of your hand.'' Like any mouse, the Lightglove can also be used to hunt and peck on a keyboard on the computer's screen.
The Lightglove is expected to become available in May for $399 at www.lightglove.com.
Mr. Howard said he expects to adapt the Lightglove to work with telephones, entertainment centers, gaming platforms, household appliances, electronic musical instruments and ATM's.
The device may also prove useful for medical workers who use computers in sterile environments, he added.
