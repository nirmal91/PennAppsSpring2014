The Port of Houston reached a $100 million settlement in a three-year-old suit regarding environmental damage by a pesticide manufacturer. The agreement calls for the present and former owners of GB Biosciences, which made DDT, to buy 112 acres of contaminated land, remove a half-million cubic yards of sediment and create an indemnity fund against future pollution.
