A grouping of thumbnail sketches on Dec. 31 with a front-page article about the economic proposals of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination referred incorrectly to Gen. Wesley K. Clark's plans for spending on large health care programs. He has indeed offered specifics: $695 billion over 10 years, partly to guarantee coverage to all uninsured Americans under 22 and to subsidize insurance for those who have trouble paying for it. The sketches also misstated the positions of John Edwards and Howard Dean on Nafta. They say they will indeed renegotiate it and other trade agreements.
