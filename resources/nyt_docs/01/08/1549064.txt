To the Editor:
Re ''Design Selected for a Memorial at Ground Zero'' (front page, Jan. 7):
''Reflecting Absence'' is an appropriate name for this design. It truly represents absence -- the absence of any reminder of what it is supposed to memorialize! Another fine example of trying to sweep under the carpet the murder of my husband and almost 3,000 other innocent people in New York on 9/11.
Where is the truth about what happened to these people? Where are the lessons we are supposed to learn? What will the message be 100 years from now? That the events surrounding the attack and the murders were too horrible for anyone but the families so we pretty it up?
The deaths of each and every one of the almost 3,000 victims, including my husband, deserve to be remembered by depicting the truth about that horrible day. To do anything less is a dishonor to them all.
