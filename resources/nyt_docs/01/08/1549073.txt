To the Editor:
Re ''Give Residents a Place to Park,'' by John Rosenthal (Op-Ed, Jan. 4):
While it may be nice for people not to have to hunt for a parking spot at night, what about those who drive to work in the morning? They, too, need to park! Would they get a permit as well? Would they have two permits, to park at home and at work?
And if there are 60 potential spots to park on a block but 100 car owners, who gets priority?
Nice idea, but very messy. And beneficial only to the car owner around his or her abode. Take the car anywhere else, and you are in trouble!
