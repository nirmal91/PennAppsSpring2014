Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, beginning a two-day swing through New Hampshire to talk to workers about his economic plans, said he would create a White House ''director of family economic security'' to guard workers' pensions and savings, protect them from identify theft and ensure fair lending and housing. In Bedford, he unveiled a workers' bill of rights, a new umbrella for his proposals on taxes, health care, trade and workplace issues. Its 10 items are less a set of legislative measures than ''a group of efforts and initiatives and ethics that we embrace,'' Mr. Kerry said. The New Hampshire trip is Mr. Kerry's last until the Jan. 19 caucuses in Iowa, where he is concentrating his efforts in hopes of an unexpectedly strong showing.
