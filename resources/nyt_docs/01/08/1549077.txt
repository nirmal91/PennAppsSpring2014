To the Editor:
Re ''Rose, in New Book, Admits Betting on His Team'' (front page, Jan. 6):
Pete Rose's long-overdue admission that he bet on baseball is nowhere near sufficient to gain him entrance into the Hall of Fame.
He maintains that he never bet against his team, but his betting on some games and not others could have influenced his managerial decisions, diverting the goal from winning as many games as possible to winning selected games.
Rose could have spent the last 14 years using his experience to warn others about the dangers of gambling, but even now he seems not to understand how betting corrupts the game.
Baseball needs a deterrent against gambling. Rose's continued banishment sends the message to all players: if you bet on baseball, even 4,256 hits won't get you into the Hall.
