To the Editor:
Re ''Rebuilding a Life Shattered by War'' (letters, Jan. 1), about Sgt. Jeremy Feldbusch, who lost his eyesight in military operations in Iraq:
I was blinded by service in Vietnam, and I hope that his experience is better than mine was then.
It took years to receive compensation from the Veterans Administration, and virtually all veterans organizations were unable or unwilling to help support my claim or my changed needs.
In my struggle, I lost a marriage, gainful employment and many friendships before I was able to get past the grief and to realize that I had not lost more (and certainly not less) than my ability to see.
I hope that service members returning from Iraq get more responsive and competent help than our troops coming home from Vietnam did.
There still are few easy days.
