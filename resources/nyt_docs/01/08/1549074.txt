To the Editor:
John Rosenthal (Op-Ed, Jan. 4) offers a poor solution to New York's parking problems.
I live in Chicago, which has a residential parking permit system. The effect of this system is both to discourage residents from buying parking spaces and to encourage residents to buy cars. New York needs just the opposite.
We live in a time when public spaces are constantly being given away for private use. Residents do not own the streets outside their homes. These streets belong to all of us. Perhaps a better solution would be for New Yorkers to secure proof of off-street parking before they can buy a car.
