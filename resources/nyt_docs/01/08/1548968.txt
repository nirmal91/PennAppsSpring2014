To the Editor:
Most Catholic bishops talked to their hired auditors and found that they were doing fairly well (''Dioceses Are Moving Ahead on Abuse, Audit Finds,'' news article, Jan. 7). When I was a child and we needed support and praise, my mother taught us to reach over our shoulder and give ourselves a pat on the back.
