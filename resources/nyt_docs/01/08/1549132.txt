The federal government said yesterday that it had lifted a ban that prevented WorldCom from bidding on new government contracts but that it would continue to scrutinize the company's ethics and accounting practices.
The lifting of the ban removes another significant hurdle for WorldCom, which plans to change its name to MCI. In October, the company won approval for a reorganization plan allowing it to emerge from the largest bankruptcy in history.
In July, the General Services Administration -- the agency that oversees federal procurement practices -- proposed barring WorldCom from doing business with the government. While the government considered the matter, WorldCom was precluded from bidding on contracts, a company spokesman said.
Government officials said they considered banning WorldCom permanently because they were concerned about its ethics policies and practices, and about its accounting practices and other internal controls.
But David A. Drabkin, the deputy associate administrator of acquisition policy at the G.S.A., said that WorldCom had made significant strides in both areas.
''They have completely revamped their ethics program,'' Mr. Drabkin said. He cited ''substantial changes in the way WorldCom does business.''
Still, Mr. Drabkin said the government would continue to require WorldCom to file periodic reports that prove it was ''continuing to operate under the changes they've made.''
''We're concerned, given the gravity of the problems that led to the proposed disbarment, that we continue to watch them until the changes become a part of their permanent culture,'' he said.
A spokesman for WorldCom said that among the changes it has made, it has trained all its 55,000 employees in ethics, hired a chief ethics officer and taken steps to ensure its accounting controls are in place.
In a statement, Michael D. Capellas, the chairman and chief executive, said the decision was a ''sign of confidence in the new MCI.''
WorldCom said it had $1 billion in annual revenue from the government, but that only $300 million was tied to direct G.S.A. oversight.
