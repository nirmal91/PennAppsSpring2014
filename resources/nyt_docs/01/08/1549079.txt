To the Editor:
It would be the height of hypocrisy if Pete Rose, one of baseball's star players, were allowed back into baseball and elected to the Hall of Fame after finally admitting that he placed bets on his team and other teams and lied about it (front page, Jan. 6).
That Rose's admission of guilt and contrition appears in his new book suggests that his mea culpa might have been done to increase the sales of his book.
In coming to a decision about Rose, Commissioner Bud Selig should remember that Olympic athletes who have been caught using performance-enhancing drugs are stripped permanently of their titles and medals.
