To the Editor:
The winner of the World Trade Center memorial competition appears a good choice (front page, Jan. 7), and potentially better than the development that will surround it.
Michael Arad's and Peter Walker's elegant, ground-level design can be experienced at will. This is closer to a democratic form of remembrance than ''freedom'' skyscrapers, and more appropriate to the kind of society we purport to be.
