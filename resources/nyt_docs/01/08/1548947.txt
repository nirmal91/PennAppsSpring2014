Most candles are made from paraffin, derived from petroleum or coal. The makers of soy candles say that theirs produce less soot. Because soy wax is soft, it often comes in containers like the frosted cylinders, above and left, from Kiss My Face ($6.95 to $15 at www.kissmyface.com). Bluewick candles, below, made in California by Art Hernandez, include $5 scented Pocket candles redolent of cucumber seed and fig from essential oils, and Grand, which is a 20-ounce candle in a glass cylinder, $45; www.bluewick.com.
