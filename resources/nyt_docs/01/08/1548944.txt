Two hundred pieces of vintage Steuben glass are for sale at the Steuben store, 667 Madison Avenue (61st Street). Before 1933, Steuben produced only colored glass designed by Frederick Carder, the company president. In 1933, a design staff started producing clear modern pieces to compete with Scandinavian designs. The vintage pieces are all out of production. Most are colored glass from the 1920's and 30's; the most recent clear piece is from 1950. A clear cigarette urn is $250; eight amethyst-colored dinner plates are $3,200; a blue perfume bottle similar to the one at right is $1,500. The exhibition ''Glass and Glamour: Steuben's Modern Moment'' is at the Museum of the City of New York (Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street) until April 24.
