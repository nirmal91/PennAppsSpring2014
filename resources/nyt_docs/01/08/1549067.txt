To the Editor:
Re ''Design Selected for a Memorial at Ground Zero'' (front page, Jan. 7):
Civilians and rescuers sanctified this patch of earth.
Ground zero in New York City is a national monument and should not be covered up or prettified.
Gardens and fountains, retail stores and office space can go anywhere.
Consider Gettysburg, Antietam, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Don't settle for mediocre design for this site of national remembrance. Don't trivialize it.
Healing occurs over time. Find a way to make that happen.
