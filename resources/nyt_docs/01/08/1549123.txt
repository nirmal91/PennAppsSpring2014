BaylessCronin in Atlanta, part of the Merkley Newman Harty &amp; Partners unit of the Omnicom Group, is closing and will be merged with another Omnicom agency.
Scott Lahde, a spokesman at Merkley Newman, which is based in New York, confirmed reports of the closing on Adweek.com.
Mr. Lahde said he did not know when the agency would officially close or which agency would absorb its operations. Executives at BaylessCronin referred inquiries to Merkley Newman.
Adweek.com reported that the remaining 6 BaylessCronin staff members, down from a peak of about 60, would be hired by the Grizzard Agency in Atlanta, an Omnicom sibling. Chip Grizzard, president, did not respond to a message seeking comment.
BaylessCronin was formed in 1999 by the merger of Bayless &amp; Partners with the Atlanta office of Merkley Newman.
Remaining clients included the Atlanta Hawks, the Discovery Channel and the Smith Barney division of Citigroup.
THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  January 9, 2004, Friday  An entry in the Addenda listing of Business Day yesterday about a decision by Merkley Newman Harty &amp; Partners to close BaylessCronin, an Atlanta advertising agency, misidentified the agency that works for the Smith Barney division of Citigroup. It is Merkley Newman, not BaylessCronin.
