Elan, the drug maker, said that its treatment for chronic severe pain had successfully completed tests requested by the Food and Drug Administration and that the drug would probably be available within a year. Elan applied for permission to sell the drug, Prialt, in Europe in May. About 300,000 patients in America are candidates for pain treatments like Prialt, which are administered into the fluid around the spinal cord and brain.
