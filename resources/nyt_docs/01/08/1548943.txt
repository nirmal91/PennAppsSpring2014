It's high design defeated by even higher design -- as in the upstairs neighbors. A complaint filed in Supreme Court in Manhattan by Vitra, the furniture maker, alleges gross negligence by its landlords and Soho House, the private club above the Vitra showroom and offices at 29 Ninth Avenue (13th Street). Vitra contends that ''flooding'' from upstairs at Soho House, where there is a spa, occurred at least seven times in 2003, causing $3 million in property damage -- including a ruined $7,000 Jasper Morrison sofa. The complaint asserts that the defendants ''cavalierly turned a blind eye'' to leaks that led to ''killer mold.'' A Soho House spokesman said club officials ''expect it all to be resolved amicably.'' But if leaks continue, said Debra Guzov, a lawyer for Vitra, the store may install mold-resistant Humitek by Sheetrock.
