Citing disclosures in an award-winning documentary on the Long Island father and son convicted of molesting students, a lawyer filed a motion in Nassau County Court here on Wednesday to vacate the conviction of Jesse Friedman, left. His father, Arnold, who pleaded guilty to molesting computer students in Great Neck, died in prison. To avoid a longer sentence, the son also confessed, and was paroled after 13 years, said his lawyer, Earl H. Nemser. The film, ''Capturing the Friedmans,'' claims that most of the students had denied being molested but that some changed their stories after being badgered by investigators. Had Jesse Friedman had that information, he would have contested the charges, Mr. Nemser said.
