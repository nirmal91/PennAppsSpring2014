To the Editor:
''Back of the Tracks,'' by Verlyn Klinkenborg (The City Life, Jan. 4), sort of romanticizes life along the other side of the tracks. But there is nothing romantic about the detritus of the transient public.
Basketballs and hubcaps, refrigerator doors and old shoes are relics of a slovenly society, to be unearthed by future archaeologists for study of their ancestors.
When I traveled in Canada, by car and rail, I always noticed the missing trash as well as the absent signs proudly announcing that the next few miles were clear of debris, courtesy of a local church or scout troop. I would point out to my children and grandchildren that in a region where people take pride in their surroundings, such notices are unnecessary.
There is nothing romantic, nostalgic or cinematic about the ''back of the tracks'' in this country.
