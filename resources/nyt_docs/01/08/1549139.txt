An environmental group placed ads in the subway yesterday to remind New Yorkers that the city will fully resume recycling on April 1. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stopped the city's plastic and glass recycling program in 2002 to save money, but critics say the move did not save as much as the city had predicted. The recycling of plastic was resumed last July and glass recycling will resume in April. The subway ads, placed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, say: ''RECYCLING IS GOOD FOR THE PLANET. (But New Yorkers should do it anyway.)''
