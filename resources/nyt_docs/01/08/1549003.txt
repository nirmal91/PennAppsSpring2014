Planar Systems once made flat-panel displays for the military. But the company's first plasma television set has a feature not often associated with military contracts: a relatively low price.
The Planar PDP42HD is a 42-inch high-definition television that will go on sale at electronics stores later this month for $4,000, about $2,500 less than many plasma sets of comparable size.
The PDP42HD has all the features usually associated with plasma televisions, including picture-within-a-picture capability, on-screen zooming and freeze-framing. The seven ports for feeding signals into the set should accommodate nearly any camera, gaming console or video device.
The new set is not the first television from Planar, which has introduced a 17-inch liquid crystal set.
Nor is it Planar's first plasma panel; it offers three sizes of plasma-based computer displays.
In an apparent bid to overcome consumer concerns about buying a costly piece of equipment from a company that is largely unknown in the television world -- as well as the suspicion that low prices sometimes create -- Planar will back the PDP42HD with a one-year warranty that promises delivery of a replacement set within two days, limiting the possibility that a crucial episode of ''C.S.I.'' will not be seen in your home entertainment center.
