To the Editor:
I applaud John Rosenthal's suggestion (Op-Ed, Jan. 4) to make parking easier for New Yorkers by issuing permits that would discourage out-of-towners from taking precious spots in residential neighborhoods.
Here's another idea: paint lines on side streets to help cars park equitably and not leave empty half-car lengths that, added up, would add considerably to available parking space.
I lived in Manhattan for 22 years but owned a car for only three months of that time. I gave it up quickly when I realized that I spent more time parking my VW than driving it.
