To the Editor:
Re ''Fire Deaths in New York Jumped 23% Last Year'' (news article, Jan. 1):
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta has issued some grim statistics: Fire deaths were up in 2003 -- 119 compared with a 75-year low of 97 fatalities in 2002.
New Yorkers can read the commissioner's statistics and ignore them. Or we can learn more about fire safety and prevention and then practice what we've learned.
For example: Have you developed and rehearsed an escape plan in case of fire? Are your wiring and surge protectors approved by Underwriters Laboratories? Do you have smoke detectors, and do you change the batteries twice a year?
Do you leave at least three feet between a space heater and flammable objects? Do your candles have a one-foot circle of safety around them? Do you ever leave children or pets unattended with a lighted candle?
As we take down our Christmas trees and holiday decorations, please check that you're using U.L.-tested wiring. If not, throw these objects out.
