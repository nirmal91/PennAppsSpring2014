Almost any room can benefit from a pick-me-up. And there is hardly a quicker way than to add sari-cloth curtains or a bedcover made from a vintage Indian wedding shawl. Bright stacks of fabric, originally cut for clothing, are neatly packed into Hello Sari, a small shop on the Lower East Side. The textiles, 80 inches long by 40 inches wide to 216 inches long by 42 inches wide ($45 to $175) are as suitable for window treatments as for tablecloths. The owner, Kris Jensen, a fashion stylist, and her husband, Akram Mughal, buy the textiles near Lahore, Pakistan. At 261 Broome Street (Orchard Street), (212) 274-0791.
