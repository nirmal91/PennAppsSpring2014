Yoshiaki Yuki, right, is a Tokyo artist who paints bold calligraphic-inspired designs on tables, screens, plates and bowls. He will open Gallery Gen, a shop and gallery in TriBeCa, tomorrow, stocked with antique pots as well as his own pieces. Above, from left: a three-panel screen with abstract Chinese characters painted on rice paper with charcoal ink ($22,000); red and white two-panel screens ($6,000 each); and a wooden rack ($864). Above right: Painted porcelain plates, 11 inches in diameter ($200 each), descend to a blue screen ($9,000) and a 19th-century pot ($8,182). Far right, an oval ceramic bowl, 14 inches by 19 inches, is $205.
Mr. Yuki, 58, salvaged cast iron to create a hanging candle holder ($75). He painted rice paper with black swirls on a red and gold background and glued it to a 4-by-8-foot plywood table coated with polyurethane, giving the surface a darkly beautiful patina ($450). He also makes three asymmetrical porcelain dishes that stack, yielding a fanciful bento box ($185 a set). Lacquered bamboo chopsticks are $10 a pair, and red wooden bowls are $35 each.
Translating for Mr. Yuki, Timothy Di Fiore, the managing director of Gallery Gen, said, ''No matter how beautiful a clay pot is, it should be touched and used every day.''
In April the gallery will exhibit fabrics by the noted textile designer Junichi Arai. Gallery Gen is at 158 Franklin Street (Varick Street); (212) 226-7717.
