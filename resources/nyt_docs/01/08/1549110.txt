Barrow County, which is fighting a suit by the American Civil Liberties Union over a poster of the Ten Commandments in the county courthouse, has removed a display with Hindu, Muslim and other writings that a resident installed last week. Officials left the poster. The head of the Barrow County Commission, Eddie Elder, said the new freestanding display boards about other religions could blow over and hinder pedestrians.
