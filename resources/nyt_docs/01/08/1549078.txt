To the Editor:
Re ''Rose, in New Book, Admits Betting on His Team'' (front page, Jan. 6):
Those who watched Pete Rose play baseball know he was possibly the best player they ever saw play the game. There is no one in the game today who measures up to the intensity, consistency and sheer excitement he displayed on the field.
Rose's absence from the Hall of Fame does not detract from his accomplishments, but it does weaken the credibility of the Hall itself. Admitting him would actually serve the Hall in its mission to acknowledge the best who ever played.
The notion that baseball should acknowledge Rose only after he is sufficiently contrite is ridiculous. These demands are petty coming from professional baseball, that ''perfect'' place of $5 hot dogs and cities taken hostage to keep their beloved teams from leaving for more money.
