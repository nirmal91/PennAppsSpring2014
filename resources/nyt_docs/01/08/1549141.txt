Three construction workers were injured when the first floor of the four-story building they were working in collapsed during a fire yesterday, Fire Department officials said. The rubbish fire began at 1839 University Avenue in the Bronx about 3:40 p.m., and the first floor collapsed a short time later. The workers were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital. One firefighter was treated for a minor injury at the building.
