To the Editor:
Re ''Design Selected for a Memorial at Ground Zero'' (front page, Jan. 7):
The reflecting pools that may well be part of the ''Reflecting Absence'' design brought to mind the reflecting pools of the Taj Mahal.
The association is brilliant and the most enduring artistic remembrance that could be brought forth now and forever.
