Transit officials have decided to remove all scrap rail pieces throughout the subway system after a preliminary investigation into why a discarded 20-foot section of rail pierced the bottom of a subway car on Monday. No one was hurt. Rail pieces extracted during replacement work are often nailed down in the trough between tracks so they can be removed later. About a thousand rail pieces were inspected during the investigation, said Charles F. Seaton, a New York City Transit spokesman.
