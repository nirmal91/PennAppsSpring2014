The first generations of hands-free telephone headsets were still painfully bound by hard-wired connections. The best of the breed quickly evolved away from the wire. But until now, even wireless headsets could be used with only one or the other, a cellphone or a land-line handset.
No more.
GN Netcom, a maker of hands-free telephone devices, is introducing a wireless headset that can connect with either a mobile or a wired telephone.
The GN 6110 DuoLink, which weighs less than an ounce and is about the size of a silver dollar, clips on over the ear and has a small flip-out mouthpiece. It comes with a base station-transceiver that recharges the headset's battery (good for four hours of talk and a week of standby on a full charge) and can even patch desktop telephones into a Bluetooth network.
GN Netcom says the 6110, which is expected to become available for $300 early this year, has a range of 30 feet from its base station or from a Bluetooth-enabled cellphone.
And in a bit of pure gee-whiz, the headset automatically reverses its volume button functions depending on which ear it is worn with, so the volume button is always on the left.
