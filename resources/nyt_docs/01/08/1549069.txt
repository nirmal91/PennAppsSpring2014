To the Editor:
Regarding the memorial design for ground zero, you say (editorial, Jan. 1), ''Meddling by people like former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has not helped.''
In fact, the question he's most frequently asked is ''What should happen at ground zero?'' He will continue to answer that question in the same way he did when he left office:
''We should think about a soaring, monumental, beautiful memorial . . .
''Long after we're all gone, it's the sacrifice of our patriots and their heroism that is going to be what this place is remembered for. . . . We have to be able to create something here that enshrines this forever . . .
''And it's not going to happen if we just think about it in a very narrow way . . .
''I feel very, very strongly about this, and it's something that I'm not going to forget, and it's something that I'm going to continue to speak up on.''
It's perplexing that your longstanding support of free speech seems to apply to everybody except Rudy Giuliani.
