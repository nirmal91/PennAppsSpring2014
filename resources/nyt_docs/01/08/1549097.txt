The prime minister, Abdullah Badawi, said his government would continue to build a $2.4 billion hydroelectric dam in the Borneo rain forest. Some analysts had predicted Mr. Abdullah, who took over from Mahathir Mohamad in October, would shelve the dam after he scrapped a $3.8 billion rail project, citing budget constraints. But Mr. Abdullah said the dam was too far along not to complete. Originally planned as a much larger project, the dam was shelved in 1997 with the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, but not before displacing local tribes. Mr. Mahathir revived a scaled-down version in 2001.
