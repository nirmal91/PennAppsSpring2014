At a dinner party a decade ago, the Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza, right, impressed Max Protetch, the Manhattan art dealer, with a sketch. ''It must have been on a tablecloth or napkin, because I didn't manage to grab it,'' Mr. Protetch said. Mr. Siza won the Pritzker Prize in 1992, but despite masterpieces like the Borges &amp; Irmão Bank, in Vila do Conde, Portugal, below, he remains relatively unknown in the United States. But Mr. Siza is working alongside Frank Gehry on an expansion of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. An exhibition of Mr. Siza's work opens tomorrow at the Protetch gallery, with Ohm Design participating as a curator; 511 West 22nd Street (10th Avenue); www.maxprotetch.com.
