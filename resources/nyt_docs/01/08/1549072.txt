To the Editor:
Re ''Give Residents a Place to Park,'' by John Rosenthal (Op-Ed, Jan. 4):
Bravo to Mr. Rosenthal for advocating residential parking permits. My block is littered with out-of-state license plates. Everything is expensive in New York, except parking, which the city gives away free of charge.
A street-level studio on my block would cost more than $300,000. A slightly smaller space just a few yards away: nothing.
Commuters are no longer taxed for using city services. Why are we giving them free parking?
