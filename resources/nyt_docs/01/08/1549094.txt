The food retailer Royal Ahold said it had received a summons to appear before a Dutch court in connection with demands by the shareholders association VEB that it revise its results over a five-year period. VEB is asking the company to nullify annual reports from 1998 through 2002, saying Ahold failed to disclose critical information to shareholders. VEB is asking a judge to, among other things, force Ahold to reveal more information about bonuses paid to executives at its American Foodservice subsidiary, which played a major role in the $1.2 billion accounting scandal. Ahold called VEB's claims unfounded.
