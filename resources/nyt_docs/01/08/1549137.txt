The Jets' search for a defensive coordinator hit a roadblock yesterday when the former Buffalo coach Gregg Williams, who was interviewed by Coach Herman Edwards last week, agreed to join Joe Gibbs with the Redskins.
Williams was believed to be near the top of the Jets' list to replace the fired Ted Cottrell, although no offer had been made, Edwards said.
Edwards will interview the Ravens' secondary coach, Donnie Henderson, for the coordinator job today. He has interviewed the Giants' defensive coordinator, Johnnie Lynn, and the Giants' defensive line coach, Denny Marcin.
The Jets also want to talk to Tennessee's linebackers coach, Gunther Cunningham, and Philadelphia's linebackers coach, Ron Rivera, about the coordinator job, but they cannot talk to them while their teams are still in the playoffs.
The former Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Tim Lewis may also be interviewed; he and Edwards have the same agent.
