Thomas Early, finance director at the New York office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, resigned yesterday, the agency said, a day after he was charged with conspiring to inflate billings for work on the ad account of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Mr. Early left ''to devote his full energies to obtaining a full vindication in this matter,'' said a statement from Ogilvy, part of the WPP Group. Mr. Early could not be reached for comment and a call to his lawyer, Laurence A. Urgenson, was not returned.
Mr. Early and a former Ogilvy colleague, Shona Seifert, were charged Tuesday by the United States attorney's office in New York with falsifying time sheets and other documents to overbill the drug office from May 1999 through April 2000.
Both of them pleaded not guilty yesterday.
Government charges against Ogilvy related to overbilling were settled by the agency in February 2002 through measures that included paying the government $689,744 and revising its bills downward by $1.15 million.
Ms. Seifert, who left Ogilvy in 2002 to become president at the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, said Tuesday that she was innocent of the charges and would contest them.
Ogilvy has revised a statement it issued on Tuesday after the indictments were announced.
Originally, the statement ended with a reference to the charges against Mr. Early and Ms. Seifert that read: ''If true, their behavior was inconsistent with the high standards the company promotes and maintains.'' The revised version omits that sentence.
