An article in Circuits last Thursday about copying LP's onto CD's misstated the sampling settings at which the software captures the best sound from analog recordings. It is 24 bits and 96 or 192 kilohertz, not 96 or 192 bits. The article also referred incorrectly to the connection between a stereo receiver's preamplifier and a computer. The output plug from the receiver is the ''line out'' or ''record out'' connector, not ''phono out.''
