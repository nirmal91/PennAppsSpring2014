An elderly man died in a fire in his apartment last night, a Fire Department spokesman said. The man, Craven Polk, 76, lived in a second-floor apartment in the rear of the building at 461 West 153rd Street. The fire started just after 6 p.m., when Mr. Polk was cooking dinner, neighbors said. Some neighbors said that the fire -- which burned for less than half an hour -- began after Mr. Polk sent his home attendant to the grocery store. The police said the fire did not appear suspicious. Mr. Polk, who worked for the Ford Motor Company, had lived in the building for more than 10 years, a tenant said.
