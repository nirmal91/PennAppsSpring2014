Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said in Des Moines that he would push for a ban on contributions by lobbyists to presidential and Congressional campaigns as part of an effort to wipe out corruption in Washington and reduce the influence of the wealthy and the politically connected. ''The lobbyists and insiders have built a brick wall around Washington,'' Mr. Edwards said in remarks at a community center. Mr. Edwards, who does not accept campaign contributions from registered lobbyists and political action committees, called on his rivals to follow suit. He said that on his first day in office he would sign executive orders or propose legislation to carry out his changes, which include stricter limits on the lobbying activities of former government officials and more open and frequent reporting of contacts between lobbyists and government officials.
