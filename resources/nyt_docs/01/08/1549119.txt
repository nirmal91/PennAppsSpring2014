An essay in Science Times on Dec. 16 about changes in the lives of people with AIDS since the mid-1980's, when the play ''Angels in America'' was set, referred incorrectly to the history of President Ronald Reagan's public statements about the disease. He indeed mentioned it in public in the mid-1980's; occurrences included a directive by the president in 1986 for the surgeon general to prepare a major report on AIDS that would outline research efforts and ways to seek a cure for the disease.
