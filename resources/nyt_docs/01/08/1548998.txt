Ask anyone who has just been locked out of the house if the traditional door lock might be ripe for improvement, and be prepared for some attitude. But frustration over forgotten keys is just one incentive people may have to investigate the new Shepherd 210 Fingerprint Identification Doorlock, according to ArrowVision, the California biometrics company that makes it.
Flexibility is another, said Alex Cheng, a spokesman for ArrowVision. ''The Shepherd offers varying levels of security and user permissions,'' he said.
The Shepherd 210 has an external biometric sensor and contains an internal microprocessor that works by reading fingerprints and matching them against prints stored in its memory.
The $595 lock is not yet available at retail stores but can be ordered at www.arrowvision.us. It can be used on the exterior of a house; it fits easily into a standard door-lock cavity. The sensor is disguised by a sliding door, and the lock is battery-powered and requires no wiring. But its workplace virtues are more compelling: it allows 50 simultaneous users and five levels of stringency, each requiring more consistency in the amount of pressure applied and in the place on the sensor that fingers are placed.
There is a deadbolt on the Shepherd 210 for added security, and a hidden override should you burn the fingers the lock remembers or experience less radical technical problems. That last possibility may inspire you to hold onto your key ring for now.
