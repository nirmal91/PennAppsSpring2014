The self-declared autonomous region of Abkhazia, whose leader opposed the ouster of Eduard A. Shevardnadze from the presidency of Georgia in November, has declared a state of emergency after the election of his successor, Mikhail Saakashvili. The authorities in the region jailed two members of Kmara, a student group that had pushed for Mr. Shevardnadze's removal.
