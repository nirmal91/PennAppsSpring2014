Ace  275 Hudson Street  South Village  Through Jan. 17
The whole show is good, but there is one spectacular installation in this selection of works from the late 1960's and early 70's by Keith Sonnier. You would be doing yourself a favor not to miss it. Occupying a darkened space the size of a bus garage, ''Fluorescent Room'' has big, neatly arranged blocks of foam rubber, smudged and smeared in the Abstract Expressionist style with green and orange fluorescent pigment. Under ultraviolet lights, the pigments glow incandescently and the underlying geometric forms seem to dematerialize to magically hallucinatory effect.
The psychedelia of ''Fluorescent Room'' is a little misleading in that Mr. Sonnier shared with post-Minimalist colleagues like Barry Le Va, Richard Serra and Bruce Nauman ostensibly rationalistic purposes. Neon light sculptures, including loopy, doodlelike elements on the wall and straight-lined, boxy structures coming off the wall, are quasi-scientific explorations of the properties and possibilities of a new technology (new to fine art, anyway).
''Scanners,'' a set of six radio scanners tuned to different frequencies, defines an alternative kind of sculptural space, as does, in another mode, ''Live Video,'' in which wall-projected images of viewers are multiplied in real and delayed time to vertiginous effect. Other works combine light with mirrors or glass to investigate transparency, reflections and refraction.
For all its sober focus on material phenomenology, you can still feel in Mr. Sonnier's work from this period infectious moods of hedonistic and futuristic euphoria: a refreshing, wide-eyed excitement about the potentially consciousness-altering convergence of technology, Modernist aesthetics and transcendentalism.
