A Texas businessman, Richard M. Simkanin, 59, was found guilty late Wednesday on 29 federal charges stemming from his refusal to withhold taxes from the paychecks of the 49 employees of his company, Arrow Custom Plastics, the filing of fraudulent tax refund claims, and refusal to file personal returns.
Mr. Simkanin, who has been in jail since June 2003, faces a maximum penalty of 129 years in prison. Each felony count carries a five-year sentence, and he could receive as much as 12 months on each of four misdemeanor convictions. Judge John H. McBryde of Federal District Court set a sentencing date of April 30.
Jurors were deadlocked on two counts of the indictment, and the judge declared a mistrial on those.
Mr. Simkanin's lawyer, Arch D. McColl 3rd of Dallas, said he was not allowed to present what he termed crucial evidence.
David Jarvis, the assistant United States attorney who prosecuted the case, said, ''Justice was served.''
