ASPEN is a small town where you can see incredible things -- bear prints the size of snowshoes in the snow, Jack Nicholson on a chairlift, ski instructors coming down the mountain with torches at Wintersköl (Jan. 15 to 18) looking like a lava flow. The architecture in town is a mix, from the colorful Victorians in the West End neighborhood to the monster movie-star mansions on Red Mountain to new houses with rusty-looking tin roofs and industrial details -- references to Aspen's silver-mining past. The Aspen crowd is also a mix: celebrities, artists, motorcyclists, bankers, 40-year-olds who live to snowboard, yogis, snow bunnies, Australians. The four ski mountains in the area -- Aspen, Highlands, Buttermilk and Snowmass -- have every kind of terrain, from smooth as cream cheese to bumpy, steep and scary. If you're just skiing Aspen Mountain, no need to rent a car. The gondola, hotels and the best bookstore in town (Explore Booksellers, 221 East Main Street, 970-925-5336) are all within walking distance. And there's no need to pack fancy clothes. ''In Aspen, everyone is always very casual,'' said Greg Poschman, a local filmmaker who grew up here. ''In the old days, if you saw someone wearing a suit, they were either D.E.A. -- drug enforcement -- I.R.S. or a Jehovah's Witness. Since then, Aspen has become chic and trendy but the casualness remains.''

Friday
6 p.m.  1) Rocky Mountain Ommm  Although there is always something arty or intellectual going on -- a film about Nepal, a lecture on how to slow aging, a Celtic band playing -- Aspen is at heart an athletic town. Get physical right away. Go straight to the 6 p.m. yoga class at Bikram's Yoga College of India (520 East Cooper Avenue, 970-925-7276), held in a 100-degree room that is perfect for cold snowy evenings. It is taught by Kurt Fehrenbach, also one of the most popular ski instructors in town.
8 p.m.  2) Eating in Thin Air  For your first dinner at high altitude, try Range (304 East Hopkins Avenue, 970-925-2402), which specializes in ''food of the new West.'' The décor and food are light, almost Zen, with local ingredients used in dishes like Kobe beef meatloaf ($22) and Cowboy Steak ($36). Then stop in at Aspen Billiards (315 East Hyman Avenue, 970-920-6707) to play pool and drink with the new generation of ski and snowboard bums.
Saturday
8 a.m.  3) Ski Like a V.I.P.  At about 7:45 a.m., a crowd begins gathering at the Silver Queen Gondola for ''First Tracks.'' Skiers who sign up the day before in the Aspen Mountain Ski School office at the base of the mountain get to ride up the gondola before it officially opens, then ski down on the empty, just-groomed slopes. It's as quiet as skydiving.
8:30 a.m.  4) Local Politics and Doughnuts  The breakfast at Main Street Bakery &amp; Cafe (201 East Main Street, 970-925-6446) is a down-to-earth local experience. People wear ski boots and discuss town politics -- like whether drivers of electric cars should be able to park free -- over omelets and grilled potatoes piled high as moguls.
10 a.m.  5) Black and Blue  Back to the slopes. A favorite black diamond run is Hyrup's to Gentleman's Ridge to Glade No. 2. Plenty of moguls, views and tree skiing. There is a lot of intermediate terrain on the blue slopes around Ajax Express, a quad chair that is new this year, replacing the older one. If you hire an instructor, ask him or her to show you one of the shrines hidden in the woods. There's one to Jerry Garcia, with pictures of him nailed to the trees; another is known as the Shakespeare Swing, a painted two-person swing with better views than any presidential suite in town. To arrange a private or group ski lesson, you can call the Ski and Snowboard Schools of Aspen (970-925-1227). For snowshoeing or cross-country skiing, the rustic, incredibly beautiful Ashcroft Ski Touring Unlimited (11399 Castle Creek Road, 970-925-1971) is the place to go.
1 p.m.  6) People Watching  For awesome (the most popular word in Aspen) mountain scenery and great stir-fry dishes, have lunch at the Sundeck on top of Aspen Mountain. But for awesome views of people and big plates of California-Italian cuisine, go to the Ajax Tavern (685 Durant Avenue, 970-920-9333) between the gondola and the Little Nell Hotel. If it's sunny, the rustic wrought-iron tables outside will be packed. ''It's all the ski instructors and their clients sitting down for a late lunch of truffle French fries and a bottle of pinot noir,'' said Tom Passavant, a local food writer. Try Mamma's Cavatelli With Broccoli ($14) or the smoked chicken salad ($16).
4 p.m.  7) Après-Ski  Nancy Pfister, whose family once ranched on Buttermilk Mountain and who now divides her time between Hawaii and Aspen, advises: ''You must sit in front of the fireplace at two hotels, the St. Regis and the Little Nell. The Little Nell is where the millionaires go to ogle the billionaires. You can see extinct animals from all over the world in their clothes.'' (The St. Regis, above, is at 315 East Dean Street, 970-920-3300. Little Nell is at 675 East Durant Avenue, 970-920-4600.)
5 p.m.  8) The Sport of Shopping  Shopping in Aspen is an education in its population. It's a mix of the insanely expensive (movie stars) and the insanely inexpensive (ski bums). Everyone visits the modern but rustic Prada Store (312 South Galena Street, 970-925-7001) for the chance of spotting Kate Hudson or Kevin Costner among the red-fox-fur sleeping bags and black secret-agent-style ski clothes. Other favorites for clothes: O2 Aspen (500 West Main Street, 970-925-4002), a yoga studio and boutique, and P.E. 101 (500 East Cooper Street, 970-925-9317). Both emphasize fun and form-fitting. Distractions (465 East Hopkins Avenue, 970-544-9946) has groovy designer clothes: Pucci dresses and vintage belts made from saddle parts. But do not miss Susie's consignment shop (623 East Hopkins Avenue, 970-920-2376), where Norwegian-style sweaters start at $30 and there is a whole section of cashmere ($30 to $60) and ski jackets, some never worn.
8 p.m.  9) Fancy or Funky?  Cache Cache Bistro (205 South Mill Street, 970-925-3835) has black and white photos of Paris street scenes on the walls, yellow beaded lamps above each table and a definite buzz. Go for the rotisserie chicken with French fries ($22) and for the mix of people, everyone from tan, stylish Los Angeles couples to snowboarders focused on the Winter X Games (Jan. 24 to 27 on Buttermilk Mountain). Or for great Mexican food, try Blue Maize (308 South Hunter Street, 970-925-6698). The crowd is super-friendly on a normal night, but if it's snowing out, everyone will probably start singing.
Sunday
8 a.m.  10) Spiritual Maintenance  If you have a car, drive 20 miles out to St. Benedict's Monastery (1012 Monastery Road, Snowmass; 970-927-3311) for its 8:15 morning service, led by Cistercian monks. The drive there is classic Colorado. You'll pass fields full of horses, snow-covered barns and cabins, and creeks lined with cottonwoods.
11 a.m.  11) Mountain Art  Back in town, stop in for a mocha at Ink! Coffee in the D&amp;E Ski and Snowboard Shop (520 East Durant Street, 970-544-0588), which has a loyal local following of young people who hang out on its couches. If you have time afterward, walk to the David Floria Gallery (312 South Mill Street, 970-544-5705), which shows many Aspen artists.
THE BASICS  Visiting Aspen
Several airlines -- Northwest, United Express, America West Express -- and car rental agencies serve the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, which is four miles out of town.
The Little Nell Hotel (675 East Durant Avenue, 970-920-4600) is boutiquey, luxurious, full of investment bankers and movie producers and right at the base of Aspen Mountain. Its 92 rooms, including 16 suites, are $615 to $4,450.
The St. Regis (315 East Dean Street, 970-920-3300) has Oriental rugs the size of small meadows and oil paintings in gilded frames. Its 257 rooms, including 2 presidential suites, 24 alpine suites and 7 junior suites, are $395 to $4,750.
Hotel Lenado (200 South Aspen Street, 970-925-6246) takes its name from an abandoned lumber mill town near Aspen. It's all about wood, with cherry-wood twig couches in the lobby, log furniture and beds. Its 19 rooms are $285 to $335.
For a complete splurge, rent the newly renovated seven-bedroom Sardy House (128 East Main Street, 970-920-2525). It is Victorian on the outside with mod, hip furniture and art inside. It comes with a staff and costs $6,000 to $7,000 a night.
