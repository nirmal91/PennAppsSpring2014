A man pleaded guilty yesterday to hacking into the internal computer system of The New York Times and causing damage by changing information, creating identities for himself, and conducting thousands of database searches over three months in 2002. The man, Adrian Lamo, 22, told Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of Federal District Court in Manhattan that he was ''genuinely remorseful'' before entering his plea to one count of computer damage. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced on April 8.
