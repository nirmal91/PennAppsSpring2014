To the Editor:
Re ''Some School Districts Challenge Bush's Signature Education Law'' (front page, Jan. 2):
Your article reflects the growing realization that the No Child Left Behind Act is a monumental bureaucratic monster unleashed by the political machinations of a president intent on a piece of signature legislation.
The reality imposed at the local level is one of confusion, financial hardship and logistical turmoil.
You cannot legislate academic success.
