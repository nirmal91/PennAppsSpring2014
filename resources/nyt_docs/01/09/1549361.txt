To the Editor:
Re ''The God Gulf,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 7):
Statistics do not back up the often-repeated claim that Democrats are nonbelievers. The country is evenly divided politically, yet the vast majority of Americans believe in God. This means that the majority of Democrats are among the faithful.
The difference is that Democrats understand the dangers of injecting religion into the political arena. We practice our faith by action and in our daily personal lives, not by dogmatic proselytizing.
It is interesting that it is right-wing Americans who shout the most invective against religion-controlled states and the terrorism that has ensued because of religious extremism imposing itself on political bodies, yet their insistence that America become a religious state is getting louder and louder.
Have we learned nothing from what we've seen the last couple of years?
