Steve Rosner, the agent for Jim Fassel, said yesterday that the former Giants coach was ''disappointed but not down'' about the Washington Redskins' decision to hire Joe Gibbs days after Fassel had interviewed for the job.
''Jim understands that the Washington Redskins' situation was unique,'' Rosner said in a telephone interview. Fassel was a candidate for the Washington job and also for the Arizona Cardinals' position, which was filled Wednesday by Dennis Green.
Fassel has been interviewed for the Buffalo Bills' head coaching job and may be a candidate for the Chicago Bears' job.
''If at the end of the day he does not get a job this year,'' Rosner said, ''this will not be the end of Jim Fassel's coaching career in the N.F.L. Two guys that got hired yesterday besides Gibbs -- Tom Coughlin and Denny Green -- were two guys who sat out a year.''
