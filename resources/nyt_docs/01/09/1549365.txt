To the Editor:
''Politics at the Border'' (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8) claims that President Bush's proposal to liberalize rules for immigrant workers seeks to ''re-establish his credentials as a compassionate conservative.''
Mr. Bush wants to allow immigrants to take jobs ''that American citizens are not willing to take.'' Some might wonder why none of the nearly nine million unemployed Americans don't want the jobs involved until we remember that the $5.15 minimum wage isn't enough to bring an average family out of poverty.
Mr. Bush's idea reinforces his ''conservative'' (pro-employer) credentials, but without an accompanying hefty increase in the long-neglected minimum wage, it can hardly be called compassionate.
