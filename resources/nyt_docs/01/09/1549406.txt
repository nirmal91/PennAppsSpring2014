Charlie Ward is leaving home for his best chance at a title.
The Nets and the Knicks were among 12 teams that pursued Ward after he was waived by Phoenix on Tuesday, but Ward told TNT last night that he had decided to sign with the San Antonio Spurs, the defending N.B.A. champions. An official announcement is expected today.
Ward, who has played only with the Knicks since they drafted him in 1994, had told his agent, Craig McKenzie, that he wanted to stay in the New York area to be close to his family. But a friend of Ward's said his top priority was to win a championship. Ward will play with Tim Duncan and back up Tony Parker.
No contending team could offer Ward more than a prorated minimum contract worth about $700,000. The Spurs might give him a multiyear deal, but the Nets did not appear willing to make such a commitment.
