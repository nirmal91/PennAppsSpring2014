To the Editor:
''Where the Cows Come Home: Sanctuary Farm Applauds Ban on Butchering of Sick Animals'' (news article, Jan. 2):
I applaud the Farm Sanctuary for educating the public on the cruelty of factory farming. It is sad that it takes human beings' getting sick for us to to see the madness of farm animal abuse.
As a vegan, I feel secure that I won't develop mad cow disease. But the real reason I don't eat meat is the torture of these gentle animals their entire lives. I just can't stomach that.
