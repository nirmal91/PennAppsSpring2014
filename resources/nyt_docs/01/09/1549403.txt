Tests conducted for the National Transportation Safety Board found traces of a prescription painkiller in the blood of the man at the helm of a Staten Island ferry that crashed last year, officials said yesterday. Assistant Capt. Richard J. Smith told investigators after the Oct. 15 crash -- which killed 11 people and injured dozens -- that he had taken blood pressure medicine and probably passed out at the helm. But two witnesses said he was upright at the controls, officials have said. The N.T.S.B. tests, first reported yesterday in Newsday, found the painkiller Tramadol, officials said. The drug had not been found in tests performed for the Staten Island district attorney's office by a laboratory in Pennsylvania. A lawyer for Captain Smith declined to comment.
