To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Would Give Illegal Workers Broad New Rights'' (front page, Jan. 7):
President Bush has demonstrated great courage. He is addressing the immigration issue in a humane manner that lives up to our American tradition.
So many hard-working immigrants are struggling to survive in America. Their undocumented situation is a national disgrace, and this policy recognizes that we are still a civilized democratic society.
Apparently, only immigrants still believe that you can be anything you want to be in America. Immigrants value what we have here, while some Americans have become lazy.
Xenophobia is embarrassing. The richest people on earth are whining.
