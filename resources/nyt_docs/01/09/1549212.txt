Don't judge Zona Rosa by its peanut-butter frozen tequila margaritas. Enough of them are likely to have the same impact brandy Alexanders had on a couple of my relatives at a wedding years ago: during the reception two women, both of a certain age, either decided to roll down a hill or couldn't help themselves.
The rest of the Nuevo Mexicano food at the restaurant is well conceived and savory. Many of the dishes have ingredients foreign to the traditional Mexican cocina, but are nonetheless perfectly suited to it (that peanut butter notwithstanding). This may be the only Mexican restaurant that has hamachi on the menu, served in crisp tostadas with refried beans and habanero marmalade. Pickles are served with roasted pork, ham and Swiss cheese, Adrian Leon's take on the Cubano sandwich. Mr. Leon is from Mexico City and has worked in Rosa Mexicano at Lincoln Center.
Mexican lasagna is made with layers of cornmeal and corn kernels with chicken and cheeses, much less likely to sit in your stomach than the Italian version it takes for its model. A ceviche of scallops, octopus, clams, mussels and shrimp is light and full of flavor.
The pastry chef pays homage to Mexico -- there is a beautifully executed flan -- but it hardly matters: the desserts are all delicious.
The downstairs dining room is cozier than the one upstairs, where the bar dispenses other drinks besides crazy margaritas. There are the usual Mexican touches -- tile walls, cactuses, pottery -- but you go to Zona Rosa for the food, not the d√©cor. Open only six weeks, the restaurant offers a $17.95 three-course prix-fixe lunch and is already busy.
Zona Rosa, 40 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-2800. Dinner entrees: $18 to $27.
