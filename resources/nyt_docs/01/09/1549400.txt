The former coach of a girls' school swim team was arrested yesterday and accused of arranging to meet a 13-year-old girl for sex. The man, Ronny Seigle, 48, of Brooklyn -- who coached 12- and 13-year-old girls at the Good Shepherd School -- did not know that the ''girl'' he had communicated with on the Internet since August was a police detective, the authorities said. Mr. Seigle has been charged with attempted-sex offenses, endangering the welfare of a child and attempted dissemination of indecent material, the district attorney's office said.
