An 11-year-old girl who was observed selling heroin should not be prosecuted, South Miami police recommended, though they asked prosecutors to add child endangerment to the drug charges lodged against the girl's mother. The state's attorney's office said it was inclined to agree. The mother, Alison L. Davis, 36, was arrested last week on drug trafficking charges after the police watched her daughter deliver heroin to buyers while she was dressed in her school uniform or nightgown. The girl and her 7-year-old sister have been placed in foster care by social services officials.
