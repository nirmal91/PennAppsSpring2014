The Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York is reorganizing its largest agency, Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners, two days after the unexpected firing of a longtime senior executive.
The West Coast operation of Kirshenbaum Bond, called KB&amp;P West and based in San Francisco since 1997, is being dissolved and combined with Kirshenbaum Bond, based in New York. The agency will have two offices, in New York and San Francisco. The general manager of KB&amp;P West, Nigel Carr, also a managing partner, was fired Tuesday after working for Kirshenbaum Bond for more than 12 years.
Noel Cottrell, 36, who had been managing partner and executive creative director at KB&amp;P West, keeps those titles at Kirshenbaum Bond San Francisco. Two other executives are joining him there with the titles of managing partners: Porter Gale, 37, who had been creative director at Porter Pictures in San Rafael, Calif., and Matt Hofherr, 35, who had been managing partner and chief marketing officer at the San Francisco office of Direct Partners, part of the Omnicom Group.
''My termination came totally out of the blue,'' said Mr. Carr, who could not be reached for comment when he was fired. ''I'm still in a state of shock.'' Mr. Carr said he planned ''to take some time figuring out what to do next.''
