A woman died and a firefighter suffered minor injuries in a fire in Washington Heights yesterday, a Fire Department spokesman said. The woman, Bertha Ortiz, 77, was found in her bedroom after the blaze tore through the fourth floor of her apartment building at 701 West 175th Street. She died from her injuries soon after, the spokesman said. The fire began about 4 p.m., said Melanie Gonzalez, 19, a tenant on the third floor. Neighbors ''started screaming and banging on the doors, telling everybody to get out,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. The landlord, Joshua Siegel, said the fire was probably caused by a lit cigarette.
