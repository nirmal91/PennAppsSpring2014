The government unveiled a bill that would let universities nearly triple their annual tuition fees, charging as much as $5,500 a year. In concessions to Labor Party critics in Parliament who have threatened to vote against the bill, the bill's sponsors said it would provide almost complete financial aid for students whose families earn less than $27,500 a year. Under the plan, students would not have to pay their tuition fees until after they had begun earning $27,500 a year, and outstanding loans would be written off after 25 years.
