Looking for an a cappella comedy group? A flamenco sextet? A one-person show about Frank Lloyd Wright? Well, somebody at the conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters probably is. Over the next five days, several hundred performers and troupes will show their wares around New York City in hopes of booking gigs both in the city and beyond. Here's a sampling drawn from the showcase performance section of the association's Web site (www.artspresenters.org) describing a few of the acts that delegates to the conference can expect:
'FLLW: The Triumphs &amp; Tragedies of Frank Lloyd Wright'
