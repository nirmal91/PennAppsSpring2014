A front-page article on Wednesday about a proposal by President Bush to overhaul immigration laws misstated the number of green cards issued per year. It is 675,000 (140,000 is the number of employment-based visas). An article yesterday about the proposal also included an incorrect total from the Immigration Service. The article on Wednesday also referred imprecisely in some copies to the amount of time Mr. Bush proposes that undocumented workers could participate in a guest worker program. While the White House indeed did not specify the time, it did offer workers the option of three years, plus a chance to renew for three years.
