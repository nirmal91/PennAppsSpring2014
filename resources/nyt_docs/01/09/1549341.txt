An article on Dec. 26 about new devices to make driving safer misstated the name of the sponsor of a long-term study about the effect of distractions. It was the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, not the AAA Safety Foundation. The article also misstated the issue date of some conclusions. It was in 2001, not 2003. The article misattributed a statistic on accidents caused by distractions. It was from the National Highway Traffic Administration; Jane Stutts, the author of the AAA study, cited it in her work.
