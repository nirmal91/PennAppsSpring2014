The Stock Exchange of Thailand said that it had begun setting up a task force with regulators in response to a request by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On Tuesday, Mr. Thaksin called for the formation of a committee to monitor possible stock-price manipulation. Then on Wednesday, he ordered the finance ministry and the exchange to set up a task force to scrutinize the financial reports of listed companies to prevent money laundering. An exchange spokeswoman would not elaborate on whether the new task force would combine the two roles. Thailand's benchmark stock index more than doubled last year and Mr. Thaksin, while saying stocks are likely to rise further this year, has condemned short-term speculation by investors.
