Two environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit to prevent the United States Forest Service from permitting logs to be harvested from 950 acres of the Santa Fe National Forest that burned in last year's Western wildfires. The lawsuit, filed by Santa Fe Forest Watch and Forest Guardians, contends that much of the acreage, in the Jemez Mountains, is protected habitat for the endangered Mexican spotted owl. The Forest Service declined to comment.
