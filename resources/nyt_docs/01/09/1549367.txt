To the Editor:
With the economy still failing to produce enough jobs to lower unemployment to pre-recession levels, it hardly seems like a good time to open our borders to foreign guest workers (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8).
The president's proposal would undermine wages and keep citizen unemployment high, as rational employers would reduce wages and count on an unlimited supply of immigrant labor to fill any job that citizens leave.
