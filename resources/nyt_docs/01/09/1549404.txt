State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi released a report yesterday that said subway stations in the city were inaccessible and potentially unsafe for handicapped riders, despite $330 million that was spent on improvements. New York City Transit has until 2020 to make 100 stations accessible for wheelchairs, the report said. It included a July letter from the president, Lawrence G. Reuter, which said that New York City Transit was considering some of the report's suggestions.
