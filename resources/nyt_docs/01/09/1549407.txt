Patrick Ewing received a rousing ovation from the Madison Square Garden crowd last night when he was introduced as an assistant coach for the Houston Rockets.
But Ewing has his sights set on a more ambitious role. He hopes to be a head coach the next time the crowd sees him.
''Hey, I see Terry Porter doing a fantastic job and he only had one year experience,'' Ewing said, referring to the Milwaukee Bucks' head coach. ''So this is my second. The sky's the limit.''
Ewing hooked on with the Washington Wizards as an assistant last season before joining Jeff Van Gundy in Houston.
''I think he's got a good feel,'' Van Gundy said. ''He works at it.''
