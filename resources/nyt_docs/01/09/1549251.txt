To the Editor:
In ''Songwriters Say Piracy Eats Into Their Pay'' (Business Day, Jan. 5), Wendy Seltzer, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is quoted as saying songwriters are like ''buggy manufacturers'' and ''will have to learn how to adapt to the new technology.''
This analogy insults songwriters and composers, without whom there would be no music at all. Buggies are outmoded, replaced by cars. But who can replace the songwriter? Can the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and those who favor the ''sharing'' of music without compensation for its creators, do so?
There are legitimate issues to debate in the fight over the future of the music industry. Sure, consumers have rights. But the rights of creators have to come first, if only because creation precedes consumption.
