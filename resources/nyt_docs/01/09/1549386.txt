Thomas Glassford, a sculptor, and Claudia Fernández, a photographer, both based in Mexico City, meditate on the decline of Modernism with affecting ironic nostalgia, if not great originality.
Ms. Fernández follows photographers like Bernd and Hilla Becher and Ed Ruscha by systematically documenting architectural or design features in the urban environment. In particular, she has focused on outmoded Modernist decorative designs of facades, walls, doors and gates built for privacy and protection in Mexico City.
Ms. Fernández assembles partial, close-cropped views of rectilinear or diamond-patterned modular forms into expansive, optically charged montages. In so doing, she sets up a witty parallel between different kinds of impenetrability: that of her vernacular architectural subjects and that of the abstract picture in the gallery.
Mr. Glassford similarly creates playful parallels between vernacular design and high art in works that recall the Neo-Geo glory days of artists like Haim Steinbach and Jeff Koons. Sculptures made by stacking plastic, beige-colored cafeteria ware -- plates, cups and saucers -- invoke Brancusi on the one hand and global mass consumption on the other. And a fencelike structure made by weaving pink-tinted lengths of mirrored Plexiglas through golden vertical posts generates a rueful poetic tension between the Modernist dream of universal abstract order and the cheap seduction of boutique-style decoration.
