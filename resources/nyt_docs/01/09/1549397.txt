The lawyer for a man convicted of killing an obstetrician who performed abortions said in federal court yesterday that inmates were harassing his client. John Humann, a public defender representing James C. Kopp, left, on a charge of denying access to a clinic, told Judge Hugh B. Scott in federal court that inmates at a federal holding center in Batavia were threatening his client. Mr. Kopp was sentenced in May to 25 years to life after his conviction on state murder charges in the 1998 shooting death of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian. Mr. Kopp is in federal custody on the clinic charge.
