Rebecca Stenn and her PerksDanceMusicTheater have a compelling signature piece in ''Left of Fall,'' which opened her company's program on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater. But none of the five dances that followed had quite the wit, concision and gutsy passion of that 2003 work, a quartet set to music by Jay Weissman and Dave Eggar that sounded like Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' played by a rollicking klezmer band.
Each of the dances alluded to the idea of community. The premiere, ''The Seventh Wave,'' began with an image of a man ''suspended in space,'' as a taped voice intoned; he was actually balanced on two reclining bodies. In another potent image a man rolled out from behind two embracing dancers like a newborn baby.
The voice talked of nothingness. The dancers' bodies looked as if they had painted flames licking up at them. There were men in skirts. A baby cried on tape. What did it all mean?
Ms. Stenn has clearly been influenced by the visual imagery and humor of Momix and Pilobolus, with which she has worked. But her intellect and bold way of moving seem to tug apart from those companies' imagistic physicality, though the unyielding cleverness of her deconstruction of ''Carmen'' in ''The Carmen Suites'' suggests a full commitment to their brand of humor.
Mr. Weissman, who created the score for ''The Seventh Wave,'' filled the Joyce stage with his music, performed live onstage. But Ms. Stenn's dances, fully worked sketches for the most part, would probably have looked much stronger in a smaller, more intimate space.
Ms. Stenn's vibrant company included Faith Pilger, Eric Dunlap, Trebien Pollard, Michele de la Reza and Peter Kope, with the music supplied by Mark Ambrosino (drums), Tom Chiu (violin), Mr. Eggar (cello) and Mr. Weissman (bass). The program, part of the Altogether Different festival, will be repeated tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea.
