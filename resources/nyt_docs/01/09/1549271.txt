Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said on Thursday that he had raised about $18 million for his presidential campaign in 2003, short of his $20 million goal.
''I've raised, I think, in the neighborhood of $18 million,'' Mr. Gephardt said in response to a question at a meeting with local Democrats here. ''We think that's enough to get through these early primary states.''
Advisers to Mr. Gephardt, who has been struggling to raise money, say he has only enough money to carry him through the Feb. 7 contests in Michigan and Washington State.
