The Sports Authority in Englewood, Colo., yesterday named Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners in New York as agency of record on its account, which had been handled since 2000 by the Tampa, Fla., office of West Wayne. Billings were estimated at $80 million.
The decision came after a five-month review that had been narrowed to Freeman and other finalists that included Ziccardi Partners Frierson Mee in New York. The review began as Sports Authority was merging with Gart Sports, which runs stores under the Gart Sports, Sportmart and Oshman's names. West Wayne resigned the account in November by withdrawing from the review. The decision is the second recent account gain for Freeman after landing a creative assignment from the TBS Superstation cable network. The gains come after two years of major losses.
