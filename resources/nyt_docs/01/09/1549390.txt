The group shows organized by the critic David Hunt have focused increasingly on intense local color, which makes sense given its rising ubiquity in contemporary art. The show takes its name from an international producer of color swatches, many of them in colors that are new and don't exist in nature. The work here, by a dozen young New York artists, ranges through different styles and materials while sticking fairly firmly to conventional painting and sculpture.
An admiration for the Pop colors, Op patterns, shaped canvases and general glitz of the 1960's is frequently present, especially in the work of Ernest Jolicoeur, Jin Meyerson, Mackalene Thomas and, especially, Rory MacArthur, whose efforts, in acrylic and enamel on hand-carved Styrofoam reliefs, have something in common with the work of Frank Stella. Nicole Cherubini's ceramic vases outfitted with chains, rings and fur collars show promise, although fewer accessories would be better. Ryan Johnson's ''Rendezvous'' is a little too deep into Tom Friedman's exquisitely crafted territory, but this larger-than-life construction-paper sculpture, which depicts a reluctant adolescent suitor about to surprise someone with flowers pulled from a nearby garden, is impeccably done.
The three-dimensionalized movie poster of Will Smith by Ivan Witenstein, and Jesse Bercowetz and Matt Bua's enormous ''Chandelier-Shanty Lair,'' make up for what they lack in color with scale and aggressive forms. They might steal the show if all the other artworks weren't putting up such a fight.
