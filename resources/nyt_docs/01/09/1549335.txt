Retail sales rose 5.2 percent in November from levels a year earlier, as a flood of tourists joined residents in stores. The biggest increase, 32.9 percent by volume, came in electrical goods and photographic equipment, which are sold in large quantities to visitors. The increase in retail sales in October, announced last month as having been 3.8 percent, was revised up to 4.0 percent. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome last spring produced a steep drop in retail sales, and despite the recent improvement, sales for the first 11 months of last year were still down 3.1 percent compared with the first 11 months of 2002.
