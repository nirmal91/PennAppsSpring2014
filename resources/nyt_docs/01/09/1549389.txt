ATM Gallery  170 Avenue B, near 11th Street  East Village  Through Jan. 25
The anarchic spirit of the early 1990's Scatter Art of Cady Noland and Karen Kilimnik is visible in the work of several young artists, whether they know it or not. The efforts of Kelley Walker, Nate Lowman and Banks Violette are cases in point.
So is ''Joy to the Max,'' a carefully orchestrated trailer-park Bad-Santa accumulation of objects and materials that is the first collaboration between Eunice Kim, an installation artist, and Joe Bradley, a painter.
Made mostly of discarded objects, this study in abjection suggests the morning after a Christmas from hell, or maybe a crime scene. It includes portions of wall-to-wall carpet, broken chairs, empty beer cans, mirrors both broken and not, burnt candles and sprinklings of packing material, cut ribbon and tissue paper, as well as a few pieces of relatively innocent-looking children's art. As with earlier Scatter Art, the work coyly challenges you to see it as art, yet implies that nothing has been left to chance.
First sign: the perfectly matched gray vase and carpet near the front door (they may reflect Mr. Bradley's idiosyncratic monochrome paintings, seen in a promising debut at Kenny Schachter last spring). Other signs: a pair of black boots (one near the ceiling), a ceramic elf's shoe and a suit of red long johns. ''Don't let the good times get you down'' is the final message. There are too many precedents for this piece to be as shocking as it wants to be.
