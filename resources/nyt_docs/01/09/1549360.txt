To the Editor:
I strongly agree with Nicholas D. Kristof when he writes of moral personal behavior and social justice that ''each seems incomplete without the other'' (''The God Gulf,'' column, Jan. 7).
The pandering of some politicians to religious sentiments that emphasize personal piety is a subterfuge for their not articulating a vision of a more just society.
These politicians seem to reflect an impression of many Christians and non-Christians, namely, that religion and spirituality are self-centered, private and focused upon acquiring political power.
This kind of religious message lacks a moral call to us as individuals and citizens to make our society a better place. It mocks the essence of religion and the honest spiritual quest of many people. This deficit weakens our sense of community and our status as a democratic society.
