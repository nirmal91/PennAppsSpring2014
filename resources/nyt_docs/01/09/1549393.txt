Several hundred students stormed a building in Leipzig to prevent Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der from signing an official application for the city to hold the 2012 Olympic Games. The students were part of a group of 4,000 protesters shouting, ''First education, then games!'' The signing ceremony was moved to a nearby hotel. Students all over Germany have been on strike for more than a month against proposed cuts in university financing.
