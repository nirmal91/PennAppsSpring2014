To the Editor:
Re ''Police to Guard 12 City Schools Cited as Violent'' (front page, Jan. 6):
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein are proactive in their overhaul of New York City schools. They have a parent coordinator in every school and a library in every classroom. They have teachers screening students for reading difficulties and following up with an intervention program.
The same proactive philosophy could ease the escalating problems of school violence. As an elementary school teacher in the Bronx, I hope that the mayor and the chancellor will soon have teachers using screening instruments to identify kindergartners and first graders who enter school exhibiting antisocial behavior.
These assessments can be followed up with effective individual and schoolwide programs designed to prevent defiant, disruptive and aggressive acts. Only then will teachers be able to use fully all the new teaching strategies we are learning.
