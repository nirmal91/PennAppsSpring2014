In 1958 Karlheinz Weinberger, a semi-professional Swiss photographer who worked for gay magazines, encountered a young man in Zurich dressed in a curiously exaggerated approximation of the American denim-clad teenage rebel. This youth allowed Mr. Weinberger to photograph him and then introduced him to an extended circle of about 200 other similarly styled young cause-less rebels.
At first glance the Swiss young people look familiar in their denim pants and jackets, greaser hairdos (behives for the girls), boots, chains and heavy belts. But closer examination reveals weird variations from American styles: saucer-size belt buckles bearing photographs of Elvis, jeans held together by heavy bolts, chains dangling oversize skeleton keys or, in one case, what looks like a shell for a small cannon. They seem at once surreal and ridiculous, like members of a remote cult that heard about American youth culture via short-wave radio.
Yet Mr. Weinberger's photographs, including formal portraits and casual group pictures, neither sensationalize nor condescend; they achieve a perfect balance between sympathy and anthropological lucidity. Diane Arbus comes to mind.
As this nearly 50-year survey shows, Mr. Weinberger, now 82, went on to photograph members of Switzerland's first Hell's Angels chapter and other motorcycle gangs, and continued to produce soft porn for gay consumption. But from the mid-60's on, his photography looks only conventionally professional. In the late 50's and early 60's, a mysterious confluence of circumstances led Mr. Weinberger to make a truly unforgettable body of work.
