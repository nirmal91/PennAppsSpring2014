A city police officer, Patrick Brown, 37, of the Bronx, has been indicted on 19 counts of perjury, according to the authorities, who say he lied during hearings about parking violations. They say that at each hearing, he produced a copy of a service station invoice for towing and repairs as proof that he had had to park his car illegally, with the result that the summonses were dismissed. The city is seeking to recover the fines and penalties.
