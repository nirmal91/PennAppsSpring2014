To the Editor:
''Indonesia's Secret War'' (editorial, Jan. 3) correctly criticizes the Bush administration for failing to press Indonesia to end atrocities in Aceh for fear of offending a partner in fighting terrorism. The administration's policy is even worse than that.
When Acehnese villagers filed suit against ExxonMobil, accusing it of complicity in the Indonesian military's atrocities in Aceh, the administration argued for dismissal of the suit on the ground that it might discourage Jakarta's cooperation in combating terrorism. That sends an awful message: as long as the Indonesian government helps protect Americans from arbitrary violence, it is free to impose arbitrary violence on its own people.
