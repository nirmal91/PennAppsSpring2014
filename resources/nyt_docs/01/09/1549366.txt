To the Editor:
We should support the president in his fresh approach to America's migrant worker problem (front page, Jan. 7). Calling undocumented Mexican workers ''illegal'' is laughable hypocrisy in an economy that is undoubtedly dependent on their labors.
Furthermore, despite its underlying political motivations, the proposal represents a welcome change from the administration's past xenophobic rhetoric.
Supporters of migrants' rights should not reject the plan for its failure to reach their ideal. Rather, they must be vigilant, ensuring that the policy incorporates safeguards for protecting workers' rights.
