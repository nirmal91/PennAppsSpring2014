Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria  120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street  Manhattan  Through March 12
Luis Gispert doesn't create anything startlingly new, but in his photography, video and sculpture he weaves together familiar strands of Pop Art, Surrealism and Conceptualism with technical polish and theatrical flair. And he toys with sociological ideas with the intellectual agility of an energetic young semiotics professor.
At the Whitney's Altria satellite space, Mr. Gispert has produced an ambiguous monument to hip-hop culture. Constructed mainly of unfinished plywood, it features a giant turntable arm that traverses the gallery and appears to go right through the gallery's plate glass front wall. The arm extends from a tall, boxy construction inscribed with pencil outlines of speakers and switches; this is topped by a big circular sign with the cut-out letters (intentionally misspelling) ''Disfunctional.''
Here and there throughout the installation, shiny chains and medallions are draped and more speaker outlines are drawn on the walls. At the center of it all is a kind of throne where the seated viewer's weight causes throbbing hip-hop music to play.
Because of the unfinished wood and the fine-lined pencil drawing, Mr. Gispert's installation doesn't have quite the theatrical impact it seems to want. But there is something to be said for its commentary on the tension between consumerism and antiauthoritarian expression. That contradiction doesn't belong only to hip-hop culture: Americans in all walks of life have trouble reconciling materialist desires and the needs of the soul.
