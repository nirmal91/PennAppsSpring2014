To the Editor:
Re ''Politics at the Border'' (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8):
As a child of immigrants who subscribed to that old-fashioned notion of playing by the rules, I am disgusted at the idea of giving legal status to millions of illegal workers.
When did we start thinking that it was a good idea to reward bad behavior? In a society made great by adherence to the rule of law, I can only think that this is yet another profit-driven step on the slippery slope to our ruin.
My heart goes out to the millions of unemployed Americans and those who are underpaid thanks to the availability of cheap foreign labor.
It is great that the president is feeling compassionate for our illegal population, but compassion for working Americans who are being shoved out of plants and factories is more in order. I hope and pray that we have courageous leaders willing to stand up and do the right thing on this issue, for all our sakes.
