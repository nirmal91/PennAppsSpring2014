Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Monday about the book ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation'' misstated the year it was a best seller in Britain. That was 2003, not 2004. The article also omitted the context for a quotation from Woodrow Wilson. When he called the hyphen ''the most un-American thing in the world'' he was referring to its use in constructions like ''German-American'' and ''Italian-American,'' not to the mark itself.
