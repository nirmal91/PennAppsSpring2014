To the Editor:
President Bush's attempt at immigration reform is nothing more than a cynical attempt to garner the Hispanic vote and to cater to the needs of his friend President Vicente Fox and the Mexican government (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8).
Unable to get its own economic act together, Mexico exports its poorest people to America. They sneak across the border; they work for low wages; they send money back to Mexico; and they use our social services, our hospitals and our schools.
It's a great deal for Mexico, and contrary to all those who say it helps our economy, it's a very bad deal for America.
But if I were a poor Mexican, I'd probably be coming here, too.
