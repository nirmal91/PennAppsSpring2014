The troubled credit card company LG Card was forced to halt cash advance services at most banks in the country as a liquidity shortage worsened. LG Card, strapped with about $17 billion in debt, temporarily halted all of its cash advance services in late November, until its creditors offered $2 billion in emergency loans to avert a bankruptcy. An LG Card spokesman said the liquidity crunch might worsen unless creditors offered more emergency loans. About 14 million South Koreans are LG Card holders, with many of them using cash advances obtained from credit cards to repay other loans. LG Card's 16 creditors have been unable to reach a decision on a costly rescue plan because of disagreements on how much each lender should provide and over who should manage the company.
