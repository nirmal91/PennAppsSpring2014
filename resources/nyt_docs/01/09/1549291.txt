The Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday that it had restructured its senior management in an effort to deal with lagging attendance, controversies over some exhibits and problems at its National Zoological Park.
The head of the nation's best-known museum and science complex, Lawrence Small, said he had elevated Sheila Burke, under secretary for American museums and national programs, to a new position of deputy secretary and chief operating officer.
In other changes, the director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Ned Rifkin, will fill the newly created position of under secretary for art.
And David Evans, who oversees the science museums, research centers and the national zoo, will now add the National Air and Space Museum to his responsibilities.
The national zoo has had a series of well-publicized animal deaths, and the air and space museum's new facility near Dulles International Airport has been criticized because of its handling of an exhibit of the Enola Gay. Critics contend that the display does not focus enough on the dropping of the bomb on Japan.
