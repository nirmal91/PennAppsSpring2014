It's becoming easier to use flexible spending accounts for medical care. The accounts, offered by many companies, let employees use pretax money to pay for things like eyeglasses and dental care, or deductibles and co-payments not covered by health insurance. But only small percentages of employees use these accounts, in part because they don't like the trouble of submitting claims and waiting to be reimbursed, consultants say.
That may no longer be a problem with a service started this month by Hewitt Associates, the human resources consulting firm. Through Hewitt, employees can pay for purchases from the accounts with a debit card issued by MasterCard. So far, about 50 of Hewitt's corporate clients have signed up.
