To the Editor:
After reading ''Will Nice Old Building Finish Last?'' (Jan. 4), it occurred to me it would have been better with the headline, ''Will the Citizens and Taxpayers of White Plains Finish Last?'' Was it necessary for our elected officials to have agreed to build the tallest downtown buildings in Westchester in my small city? Are these buildings to be our very own twin towers? Is it necessary to further compound the quality of life issues of the citizens of White Plains with the developer Louis R. Cappelli's ''behemoth of a project?''
In his quest to build a ''superior'' product, he sees nothing wrong with trampling on the concerns and rights of the people who live in White Plains and who support their city with their votes and taxes.
May I remind our elected officials the meaning of the legal concept ''eminent domain,'' the right of the government to take private property for public use. I assume this means for the good of the public. Where is it written that tearing down a beautiful old building, consistent with the architecture of the community, that the owner is spending millions to restore, will in some way benefit the public? I see it benefiting only Cappelli Enterprises in aiding Mr. Cappelli's quest to become a nationwide builder of ''entertainment centers.''
