When the 2,052-passenger Paradise of Carnival Cruise Lines moves from Miami to Long Beach, Calif., in September, the ship will no longer be a no-smoking-anywhere-aboard vessel. Launched in 1998 and billed as the world's first and only smoke-free ship, the Paradise was a popular and, according to the company, profitable alternative to other ships offering Caribbean itineraries. But when it is repositioned to replace Carnival's Ecstasy on the West Coast, it will sail to Ensenada in Baja California and Santa Catalina Island. For that itinerary, the company felt it needed to cater to a broader clientele, said a Carnival spokeswoman, Jennifer de la Cruz.
''The ship was doing fine from a sales standpoint,'' she said. ''When you have multiple vessels on one route, you can have a no-smoking ship.''
The Ecstasy is to move to Galveston, Tex., where it will replace the Celebration, a smaller Carnival ship that will begin service from Jacksonville, Fla., in October. On Sept. 5, the Paradise will offer its last cruise out of Miami, a 14-night voyage through the Panama Canal to Long Beach, starting at $1,099 a person in double occupancy; no smoking allowed.
