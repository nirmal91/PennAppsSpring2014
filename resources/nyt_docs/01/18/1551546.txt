To the Editor:
In ''Orthodox Jews and Car Alarms: What Does the Talmud Say?'' (Jan. 11), it was alarming to learn that car alarms can stay on for up to 90 minutes. The fact is, it is illegal for an alarm to sound for more that three minutes. Cars with alarms that go over this limit deserve to be towed away.
These noises penetrate even into hospitals, which are designed to be quiet. When I was recovering from bypass surgery, I could hear the sound of these useless alarms from my hospital bed.
And so it was also alarming to read that ''the Bloomberg administration so far has sided with car alarm manufacturers.'' Mayor Bloomberg has just lost my vote.
