To the Editor:
Re ''What Ails Florida?,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 12):
Our record clearly demonstrates that ensuring that children have access to affordable health care is a top priority in Florida. That's why we have expanded coverage for child health insurance dramatically.
Since 1999, my first year as governor, financing for health insurance for children has increased by $1.4 billion, an 85 percent growth. During the same period, the program has doubled the number of children served, from 777,644 in 1999 to more than 1.5 million by the end of 2003. We will increase financing for this important program in the next fiscal year.
Some may find it easy to suggest we use one-time, nonrecurring money to finance the annual cost of expanding coverage even more than we have. But what will happen to the children next year? The notion that we would provide coverage to a child, only to have to cancel it after the one-time money is spent, is unfair and unwise. Rather, I continue to remain focused on those children most in need, and will continue to support sustainable increases the taxpayers can afford.
