Hilton Hotels released research last week showing that a majority of Americans feel significant stress at both home and work -- and are longing for more leisure time.
Maybe a solution is to become a hotel executive. After the study was released, one of the company's top officials, Thomas L. Keltner, said he personally had enough leisure time.
''Some days and weeks are unbelievably demanding and some are not -- you've got to address these,'' Mr. Keltner, an executive vice president, said. ''It's all about understanding and give and take. And I work with a fabulous group of people who allow me to do this.'' Mr. Keltner, who is 57 and has a daughter in college and a son who works at I.B.M., said he tries to go to Alaska once a year to fly fish, and also to his condominium near Breckenridge, Colo., three or four times a year to fish and ski.
When not on the road, he works out four mornings a week at home, and on weekends he plays golf twice at the Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles.
He also takes vacations over the Thanksgiving or Christmas holidays and during the summer.
How does he juggle all this?
''It's probably easier to be more well rounded when your kids are out of the house,'' he acknowledged.
