Putting thousands of callers to Nassau's 911 center on hold is not the only problem the county police department faces, according to an audit released last week by Howard S. Weitzman, the county comptroller.
The audit, which covers the period from 2000 to 2002, criticizes the department's 911 center for having outdated equipment, a shortage of personnel, excessive overtime and inefficient use of personnel.
In the audit, Mr. Weitzman said that the department's radio equipment, which is over 20 years old, is obsolete, with numerous dead zones. The audit also says that the Computer Aided Dispatch system, which is supposed to show the caller's phone number and location, did not function properly 35 percent of the time.
The police department, in a written response included with the audit, said that it was addressing the radio and 911 problems.
But the department strongly disagreed with the audit's proposal that a nonemergency calls be handled by a ''311'' center. ''If all non-life-threatening calls are directed to 311 but require a police response, it will only require a transfer to 911, and we are paying twice for a degraded level of service,'' the department said.
