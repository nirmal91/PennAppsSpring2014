To the Editor:
Re ''Getting to Know You,'' (Jan. 4).
Please tell the driver of the Corvette in the article about vanity license plates that a 4-and a 6-year-old have no place being in the front seat of a Corvette. They should be in the back seat of another vehicle with age-appropriate car seats. Midlife crisis or not, the protection of children should be paramount.
