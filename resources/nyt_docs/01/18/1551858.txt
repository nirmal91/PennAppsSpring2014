I commend Michael Massing for his extraordinarily sensitive and balanced description of how the Episcopal Church is coping with its consecration of a noncelibate gay bishop (Jan. 4). Most important, and unlike much coverage of the issue, the piece accurately reflects the reality that the majority of Episcopalians in Virginia and elsewhere accept this action as an inevitable and appropriate step in the church's mission to seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving our neighbors as ourselves.
