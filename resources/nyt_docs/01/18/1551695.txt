Mayor John M. Fabrizi of Bridgeport said last week that he was proud of the nearly half-million dollars he had raised in winning the general election last November.
Mr. Fabrizi thinks his message was the reason for the successful fund-raising.
''I believe people recognized my leadership capabilities and my ability to run the city of Bridgeport,'' he said.
The most recent financial reports filed show that Mr. Fabrizi, a Democrat, raised $434,941.81, while Rick Torres, the Republican challenger, raised $211,960. Campaign officials involved in the race say the amount raised by Mr. Fabrizi could be close to a city record.
In a city where Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans, Mr. Fabrizi said the money was needed to defeat numerous opponents in the primary. He said a large part of the money was spent on radio and print advertising and mailers.
''I didn't feel you could hold back on a race like this,'' he said. ''It cost money to get your message out accurately and appropriately.''
Robert D. Russo, the campaign manager for Mr. Torres, said his camp was very pleased with the amount it had raised, adding that the competitiveness of the race and the effort to target new voters required so much money.
Mr. Russo also said the Fabrizi campaign had major advantages.
''It's a lot easier to raise money when you're collecting it from employees and people you have contracts with,'' he said.
The Fabrizi campaign currently has a debt of more than $12,000, which Mr. Fabrizi said would be covered by more fund-raising.
The Torres campaign does not have any outstanding debts, Mr. Russo said.
