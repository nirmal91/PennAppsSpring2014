To the Sports Editor:
Murray Chass is as gullible as Brian Cashman and George Steinbrenner (''Don't Blame Clemens for Yanks' Mistake,'' Jan. 13). The minute I read that Andy Pettitte had signed with the Astros, I knew Rogers Clemens's Astro-signing would take place within weeks. Make no mistake about it, Clemens engineered both defections.
And although I hold no brief for Steinbrenner or Cashman, I don't buy into the theory that they could have retained Pettitte. He has been in Clemens's thrall for about four years. When Clemens decided that he and Andy would play for Houston in 2004, Pettitte was gone. And there was nothing anybody could do about it.
