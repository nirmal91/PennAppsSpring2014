What Do You See?

It often seems that no modern childhood is complete without at least a few hundred readings of ''Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?'' Since 1967, the book's musical, rhyming couplets and jewel-toned illustrations of everyday animals have charmed families the world over.
Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle cast a similar spell with zoo animals in 1991's ''Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?'' Now they turn to endangered animals in ''Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?''
''Panda Bear'' echoes that famously irresistible chant, but this time it is answered: ''Panda Bear, Panda Bear, what do you see? I see a bald eagle soaring by me.'' The next spread features the eagle, forging another link in the textual chain: ''Bald Eagle, Bald Eagle, what do you see? I see a water buffalo charging by me.''And so it goes, introducing, one at a time, a cast of 10 endangered critters.
Although the rhymes of ''Panda'' are saddled with a few less-than-euphonious species -- like ''macaroni penguin,'' for example -- Carle's animals are dazzling confections of cut and torn, painted and patterned tissue paper. Even after more than 35 years, his style still radiates the same remarkable elemental beauty and sensitivity. ''Panda's'' predecessors conclude with a roll call of the story's animals. But here an ethereal, moon-faced child floats among the stars, delivering a more pointed but hopeful message to this newest generation of bear fans: ''Dreaming Child, Dreaming Child, what do you see? I see a panda bear, a bald eagle, a water buffalo . . . all wild and free -- that's what I see!''
