To the Editor:
We do people with cancer a disservice when we look at the disease solely through the medical lens of cure and prevention (front page, Jan. 11).
In the last 14 years, with the growth of the Gilda's Club movement, people with cancer have demonstrated that peer social and emotional support is as critical as any medical treatment.
Research for cancer prevention and cure is extremely worthwhile, but we must not forget that millions of people are living with the disease.
