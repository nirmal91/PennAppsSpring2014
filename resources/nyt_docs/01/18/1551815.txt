To the Editor:
In his letter to the editor (Dec. 28), Garry Wills writes, ''In the sexist 18th century, men voted for their wives, but they consulted the interests of their wives.'' Ah, but that was the problem. Most men did not care what their wives thought about political issues and rarely consulted or considered their interests; that was why women clamored for the vote.
