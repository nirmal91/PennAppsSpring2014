A New Haven company played a major role in verifying that a Washington State cow found last month to have the country's first case of mad cow disease came from Canada.
Genaissance Pharmaceuticals Inc. of New Haven, which usually works with pharmaceutical and bio-tech companies to determine why people react differently to a specific drug, offered to assist with the mad cow case after contacting the United State Department of Agriculture on a different matter.
Genaissance received samples of purified DNA and blood from the infected cow, its offspring, offspring of its parents and what the company presumes were control samples from unrelated cows on Dec. 26. After 24 employees worked around the clock, the group delivered the results to the U.S.D.A. in less than 48 hours.
''This is a little more difficult when you're dealing with animals, because there is a lot of interbreeding,'' said Dr. Gerald Vovis, the company's executive vice president and chief technology officer.
Dr. Vovis also said that Genaissance did not charge the government for the work.
''We thought this was in a time of national crisis and there was not time to negotiate price,'' he said. ''We were more than happy to help out.''
Founded in 1997, Genaissance also has a facility in North Carolina and employs 128 people. Dr. Vovis said the company recently held a luncheon to celebrate its work with the mad cow testing.
''It was an emotional experience,'' he said. ''People felt incredible pride in what they had done. We've generated eight million pieces of information in the past year alone, but none of them had the same importance.''
