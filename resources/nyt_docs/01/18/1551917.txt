To the Editor:
Re ''Pictures at the Hotel Armageddon'' by Richard B. Woodward [Jan. 11]:
The paranoia and naïveté of the Dienstelle Marienthal, designed to provide protection for essential personnel in case of nuclear attack, reminded me of the absurd drills years ago which required students to seek shelter under their desks. The difference being that hiding under a desk did not cost $1.4 billion.
