To the Editor:
Although it may be possible that it is more of a challenge for an urban building to attain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design award [''A Tower Designed to Be Environmentally Friendly,'' Dec. 21], I disagree with the suggestion that bicycle racks and green roofs are for suburbs only. Rather, these elements are essential for the city, and a necessity.
Bicycle racks add to our community of diversified travelers and encourage healthy and ecological lifestyles -- more bikes and less cars positively impact the smog emissions and global warming.
The Green Roofs Initiative is intended for city buildings. According to the Earth Pledge foundation, if every building in New York City built a green roof, the temperature would drop 10 degrees in the brutal summer days. This is something to look up to.
