One man was killed and three were wounded yesterday in a shooting at an abandoned building known as a haven for drug users in the Weeksville section of Brooklyn, the police said.
The names of the men involved were not released yesterday. Emergency Service Unit officers arrived outside the three-story brick apartment building at 1843 Atlantic Avenue early yesterday afternoon, believing a man was armed and barricaded inside, but when they entered, he was already dead, the police said.
A person living nearby on Buffalo Avenue, James Raveneau, 46, said the house was taken over by drug users since it was abandoned months ago. He said that around 11 a.m. yesterday, he saw a man lying on the pavement outside with a wound in his abdomen.
''He was moving and he was saying, 'Help me, someone help me,' '' Mr. Raveneau said. Later, he saw the police detain three other men, one of whom he knew from the neighborhood, he said. ''It's a shame. He's a skilled mechanic, but he's a drug addict,'' Mr. Raveneau said.
The manager of a nearby gas station, Wallenster Adolphus, 64, said he saw officers chase a man through the station's parking lot. The officers shouted to the man that he should stop or they would shoot, and he stopped, Mr. Adolphus said.
The three wounded men were in stable condition last night at Kings County Hospital Center, the police said.
