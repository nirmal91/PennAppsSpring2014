NEXT month, voters in the Michigan Democratic primary will have the option of casting their votes from their homes over the Internet. Critics of such voting raise the possibilities of fraud, privacy violations, vote buying and coercion.
But the sharpest critique of the Michigan plan came from the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Democratic candidate for president, who called it a ''high-tech poll tax.''
''If someone can vote in the warmth of their living room, but a grandmother has to go down four flights of stairs and into the cold,'' he said, ''that's not an even playing field.''
People with Internet access at home do tend to be richer and whiter than those who do not. And the Supreme Court has ruled that making polling places in the physical world inconvenient for black voters can violate the law.
Does that same analysis apply to Internet voting, which supplements rather than displaces traditional voting? Legal experts say that the question is an open one but that Mr. Sharpton's point might well have legal force.
''If you're trying to make turnout as easy as possible, it's a good thing,'' Prof. Richard L. Hasen of Loyola Law School said of Internet voting. ''If you're trying to ensure equality of access,'' he added, ''you have to take some additional steps'' to make sure it does not disproportionately benefit one group.
Heather K. Gerken, a law professor at Harvard, also noted the value of leaving home to vote. In what she called an increasingly isolated society, she said she would allow Internet voting, but only in public places.
