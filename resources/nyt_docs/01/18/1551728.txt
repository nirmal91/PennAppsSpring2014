I was amused to see ''A Safe Haven After the Hamptons'' [Soapbox, Jan. 11] continue a lengthy Long Island Section tradition of getting the names of bodies of water on the East End wrong. You habitually identify Southold Bay as Peconic Bay, miss the difference between Little Peconic Bay and Great Peconic Bay, between Greenport Harbor and Southold Bay and so on.
But this essay sets a new standard. Looking out his Greenport window at the Victorian Lady B&amp;B across the street (Bay Avenue, although he does not say so) he says, ''just a bit farther off lies Long Island Sound, studded with masts even though it is winter.'' He must be looking at Sterling Harbor, or perhaps Greenport Harbor or even Dering Harbor, although neither are particularly mast-studded just now. Or could he mean Gardiners Bay, yet farther away? But he cannot mean Long Island Sound. It lies miles away to the north, is not visible from Bay Avenue or anywhere near it and could hardly be described as ''studded with masts'' at any season of the year.
