To the Editor:
William Safire ('' 'Spinning Into Control,' '' column, Jan. 12) comments, ''Casualties in Baghdad could be compared to civilian losses to everyday violence in New York and Los Angeles.''
If these casualties are so minuscule, why is the Bush administration doing everything possible to hide them from the American public? At Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, the media are not allowed to view the arriving coffins.
Perhaps the dead and the wounded would have preferred to take their chances in New York and Los Angeles rather than being forced to become targets in an unnecessary war in Iraq.
