To the Editor:
The jobless recovery felt by so many communities across America is certainly distressing, but lamenting the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas will not solve the problem. What will? Perhaps a new outlook on energy use.
Imagine if we developed new energy systems -- if we built wind fields across the Great Plains and hydroelectric plants on major rivers coast to coast and invested in the development of ethanol and hydrogen as fuel sources.
Such a brand-new power infrastructure would surely require thousands of new jobs, from blue-collar laborers to engineers to chief executives, giving our recovery what it desperately needs: jobs. Oh, by the way, it might just reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce Arab resentment toward the United States and cut terrorist funding, too.
