To the Editor:
Frank Rich mildly castigates ''Cold Mountain'' for not addressing slavery [''Bullies Are Not What Ails Hollywood,'' Jan. 4]. In mountainous regions of the Confederate states, like the primary setting of ''Cold Mountain,'' slavery was the exception and pro-Union sentiment high.
By the same token, Mayor Fernando Wood of New York proposed seceding and declaring the city neutral in the Civil War. I don't recall that being highlighted in ''Gangs of New York.''
