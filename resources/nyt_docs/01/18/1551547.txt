To the Editor:
Your article resonated with my family. Although we are secular Jews, we live on a block saturated with orthodoxy. Alarms cause noise pollution almost every Saturday. Recently, after an incessant clamoring, I volunteered to shut off the source of our discontent, a security alarm in a neighbor's house.
''You can't do that!'' she interjected. ''You're Jewish.''
I replied that I was available as a ''Shabbes goy,'' a Sabbath gentile.
My neighbor, who is ordinarily a wonderful woman, refused, and the ear-splitting sound continued. Banning crime prevention devices is no solution. An increase in rachmones (compassion) and good Samaritans of all religious persuasions, however, would help.
