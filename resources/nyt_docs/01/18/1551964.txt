To the Editor:
''Hate Speech and the American Way'' (Week in Review, Jan. 11) says that Warith Deen Umar, a retired Muslim chaplain in the New York State prisons, ''expressed admiration for the Sept. 11 hijackers.'' In fact, Mr. Umar has condemned the Sept. 11 attacks.
Mr. Umar criticized Bush administration assertions that many hate the United States because they hate our democracy and freedom. Such criticism from a black man and a Muslim was intolerable, especially during our rush to war with Iraq, and Mr. Umar was barred from the state prisons.
The article speaks of American tolerance for dissent, but American citizens can now be jailed without charges or legal representation, the sanctity of one's home can be breached without a warrant, and the F.B.I. spies on peace groups simply because they advocate for peace.
If we don't stand up against the attacks on Mr. Umar, these attacks will soon be directed against all who dissent.
