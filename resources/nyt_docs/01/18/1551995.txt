If you're planning to visit Chinatown and celebrate the Chinese New Year, which begins on Thursday, these places will get the Year of the Monkey off to a good start.
CHANOODLE
(212) 349-1495; 79 Mulberry Street (near Bayard Street); $; Article: 10/1/03.
This bright new restaurant is an excellent place to revisit old Cantonese favorites like fried rice with two kinds of Chinese sausage, a beautiful, colorful dish. The green peas, red peppers and bright yellow egg contrast with the white of the fluffy rice.
CONGEE
(212) 965-5028; 98 Bowery (near Hester Street); $; $25 and Under: 3/19/03.
Congee is not much to look at, but the food is fresh and vivid with pure flavors. The congee is outstanding. Other superb dishes include deep-fried golden-skin chicken, chopped into manageable pieces and topped with plenty of chopped garlic and scallions.
DIM SUM GO GO * [Rating: one star]
(212) 732-0797; 5 East Broadway (Chatham Square); $$; Review: 1/3/01.
Dim Sum Go Go is a bright, happy extrovert clinging to the edge of Chinatown like a goofy sidekick. The quirky, appealing menu plays Western variations on Chinese themes, sometimes for the sheer fun of it, as in the Go Go hamburger, a steamed bun folded over a patty made from dim sum beef and served with taro French fries.
FUNKY BROOME
(212) 941-8628; 176 Mott Street (Broome Street); $; $25 and Under: 7/26/00.
From its odd name to its brightly colored interior, Funky Broome suggests youth and energy rather than conformity. Though the menu is largely Cantonese and Hong Kong, there are some Thai touches. Some of the dishes are unusual and good, like delicious pork-stuffed nutty-tasting fried lotus roots in a gingery sauce with dried cherries.
JOE'S GINGER
(212) 966-6613; 113 Mott Street (near Hester Street); $; $25 and Under: 8/20/03.
Joe Si, the chef and an owner, is the talented force behind Joe's Shanghai, a soup dumpling powerhouse with branches on Pell Street, in Midtown and in Queens. The menu here combines Shanghai-style food, including those soup dumplings, with some Hong Kong dishes.
PING'S SEAFOOD ** [Rating: two stars]
(212) 602-9988; 22 Mott Street (near Mosco Street); $$; Review: 8/9/00.
Anyone who misses the gaudy sign outside gets the message a few steps inside. Near the door, stacked fish tanks offer the menu headliners, a stellar cast that includes -- but is by no means limited to -- lobsters, eels, scallops, sea bass and shrimp.
SUNRISE 27
(212) 219-8498; 27 Division Street (near Market Street); $; $25 and Under: 9/12/01.
Almost all the seafood is excellent at this glossy Cantonese seafood house. Shrimp in their shells are served two ways, perfectly steamed to allow the subtle shrimp flavor to emerge, and salt-and-pepper style, barely crisp and deliciously savory.
