Elzie Coleman of Newburgh (N.Y.) Free Academy and Hakon DeVries of John Jay in East Fishkill, N.Y., provided the highlights yesterday at the Archbishop Molloy Stanner Games at the Armory Track and Field Center in Manhattan.
Coleman, who last week set a national indoor schoolboy record for 400 meters, narrowly missed another mark yesterday at 300 meters. He won easily in 33.28 seconds, nine-hundredths of a second off the 18-year-old record of 33.19.
DeVries scored his third straight major victory of the season in winning the 1,000 meters in a meet-record 2 minutes 29.00 seconds.
