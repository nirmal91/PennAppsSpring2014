Joining the ranks of the goldfinch, the knobbed whelk, the square dance and the dinosaur known as Hadrosaurus Foulkii, a new state symbol was bestowed upon New Jersey last week. Behold the blueberry: official fruit of the Garden State.
It may lack the cranberry's bounce and the sweetness of the peach. Surely it's not as famous as the robust Jersey tomato. Yet the modest blueberry beat out stiff competition from all of these contenders, pleasing the panel that mattered most: two classes of Brick Township fourth graders that began lobbying last year to adopt a state fruit. After much deliberation - is a tomato really a fruit? Not even the USDA could tell - they settled on the blueberry. And Governor McGreevy signed their decision into law last Monday.
Weighing in favor of the blueberry was its status as a New Jersey native -- blueberries were first cultivated in Whitesbog in 1916 by Elizabeth C. White, the daughter of a cranberry plantation owner. And New Jersey remains the second-largest producer of highbush blueberries in the nation, just behind Michigan. In 2002 alone, the Garden State yielded 42 million pounds of blueberries.
What to do with all those blueberries? Denny Doyle, vice chairman of the New Jersey Blueberry Industry Advisory Council, said there was no shortage of ways to eat them.
''Blueberries primarily are eaten fresh on cereal, on ice cream, right out of the hand,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''And then you know there's blueberry pie, blueberry muffins, blueberry pancakes. Today we have blueberry iced tea, blueberry slurry. Blueberry ice cream is getting very popular. Blueberry yogurt is No. 2 on the yogurt shelf. The Indians used them with meat, as a sauce.''
Is there anything that Mr. Doyle wouldn't eat in combination with such a versatile fruit?
''Blueberry potatoes? Hmmm,'' mused Mr. Doyle. ''Maybe garlic, or onions, or something like that.''
