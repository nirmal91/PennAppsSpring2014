To the Sports Editor:
The Philadelphia ''boo bird'' appellation is getting a little old. There was little booing during the Eagles-Packers game, despite a less than stellar beginning by Donovan McNabb and the Eagles. Nevertheless, Damon Hack apparently had a hard time coming to grips with this (''Favre Gives Eagles Pass Back to N.F.C. Title Game,'' Jan. 12) and with the fact that the Philadelphia Eagles managed an improbable come-from-behind overtime victory over Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers.
Hack thus felt compelled to alert us to booing as a nonevent, and ripped the town with this venomous aside: ''Instead of booing or ripping the seats out of the hinges, the usually demonstrative Eagles fans sat on their hands.''
I think that Hack would have better served his readers if he had related his Philadelphia football experience to his New York readers this way:
''Unlike Giants and Jets fans this season, who, when they actually showed up for games, booed their respective teams and coaches unmercifully, the Eagles fans did not boo.''
