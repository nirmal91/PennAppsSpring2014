Community colleges are more than just low-cost safety nets for students who can't get into four-year institutions. Almost half of American undergraduates attend two-year colleges, and most of them seem to like it, according to a new study by the University of Texas at Austin. The report looked at study habits and campus involvement of 65,300 students at almost a hundred public and private two-year colleges. Eighty-six percent rated their overall education experience as good or excellent, while 95 percent said they would recommend their college to a friend or family member. They were less enthusiastic about socializing (86 percent of full-time students have never participated in an activity outside class) and about contact with faculty (47 percent have never discussed ideas with professors outside class).
