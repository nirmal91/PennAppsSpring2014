To the Editor:
I disagree with the characterization of the bishop crook street-lamp as ''inevitable." As a former member of the city's Art Commission, I reviewed numerous requests from neighborhood groups throughout New York to replace the modern-style cobra head fixtures with bishop-crook reproductions.
Unless the neighboring structures dated from the late 19th century through the 1910's or so, the commission typically urged applicants to use a more up-to-date fixture.
