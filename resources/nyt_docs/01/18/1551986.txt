New York is a place where the temporal and the spiritual intersect in improbable locations, like a typical city street. For example, if a group of Indian business owners in Queens has its way, the city will soon recognize the Hindu celebration of Diwali as it does the Muslim holiday of Id al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan: by suspending alternate-side street cleaning rules.
Diwali is a five-day festival honoring Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. It is sometimes called the Festival of Lights (the word means row of lamps), and it signifies the end of the Hindu year. According to the 2000 census, there are 171,000 Indians in New York, mostly Hindus. The city also has Hindus from other places, especially Guyana and the Caribbean.
Last month, the Jackson Heights Merchants Association wrote to Mayor Bloomberg urging that the city recognize the first day as a holiday. Shiv Dass, the group's president, originally thought such a move would let Hindu city employees and public school students take the day off, although Silvia Alvarez, a mayoral spokeswoman, noted that workers and students can take days off for any religious celebrations.
Changes in parking rules changes must go through the City Council, which Mr. Dass said he plans to contact.
''They have the sacred holiday for Muslims on Id - why not for Hindus on Diwali?'' Mr. Dass said. ''The Indians' contribution is not less valuable to this country.''
The city's car owners might agree. If parking rules were suspended for Diwali, drivers could celebrate a five-day parking festival in mid-November 2004: Veterans Day on the 11th, Diwali on the 12th and Id al-Fitr from the 13th to the 15th.
