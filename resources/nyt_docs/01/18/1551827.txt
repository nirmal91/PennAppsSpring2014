ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO EAT THAT?
Reflections of a Culinary Thrill Seeker.
By Robb Walsh.
Counterpoint, $25.
Robb Walsh has journeyed from Brooklyn to Thailand tasting everything from knishes to the delicious stinking fruit called durian. In his uneven collection of previously published pieces, he recalls encounters with the strange, the sublime and the haute, and the cultures that created them. Walsh visits Ojibwa Indians who hand-harvest the only truly wild rice from Minnesota lakes. He joins the Paramin Women's Group in their simple Trinidad kitchen, where they concoct the fiery Genuine Paramin Pepper Sauce. He hunts PÃ©rigord truffles, sips Oaxacan squash soup and goes to a prison in Texas to dine on chicken-fried hamburger prepared by a charming lifer. At least one story is dated: if you head for ''the best restaurant on earth,'' Restaurant Girardet in Crissier, Switzerland, on the strength of his 1995 portrait of Fredy Girardet, you won't find the legendary chef -- he retired a year later. The closer Walsh gets to home -- Houston -- the less he has to offer non-Houstonites. Included here are Houston Press reviews of local diners, fried chicken joints (why would a foodie bother with Popeye's?) and Creole and Cajun restaurants. Sprinkled lightly with recipes, ''Are You Really Going to Eat That?'' is like a buffet: some items you may eagerly devour, some you may pass up.
