To the Editor:
Re ''Why the Next Pope Needs to Be Italian'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 11): A new pope often signals the agenda he intends to follow by the selection of his papal name. As Roberto Pazzi observes, John Paul I was the first pope to take a double name, but it was to honor the pope who made him a bishop, John XXIII, and the pope who made him a cardinal, Paul VI, both leaders of the Second Vatican Council. It had nothing directly to do with John the Evangelist or St. Paul.
Significantly, when John Paul II followed his predecessor's example in taking a double name, it was, he said, to honor John Paul I and Paul VI. In explicitly leaving out the reformist John XXIII, John Paul II was also saying something about the kind of pope he intended to be.
Not all Italian cardinals are cut from the same pragmatic cloth that Mr. Pazzi describes. Some would make John Paul II look like a liberal.
