SQUASH
A History of the Game.
By James Zug.
Scribner, $30.
Squash is an impossibly quick, impossible-to-televise game that generates very little hype. James Zug, a senior writer at Squash Magazine, gives a well-paced account of the game's development from a schoolboy's pastime in 19th-century England to an exhilarating club sport. ''To contain oneself in a relatively small room and smack a rubber ball about . . . eventually does odd things to one's mental state,'' a foreword by George Plimpton notes, and Zug provides the anecdotes to prove the point: Henri Salaun left the court twice during a match to take a shower; Eleonora Sears once interrupted play by leading the entire tournament to the beach in Atlantic City; Vic Niederhoffer kept a sock on his right hand in the locker room so that ''no one would shake my hand and distract me''; Frank Stella, the abstract painter, once said: ''I'm not tempted to paint squash scenes. All squash has tempted me to do is break my racket.'' Zug discusses the court on the Titanic, used for only four days; the hardball/softball dispute; the ''four-handed strategy'' of doubles play; and the archaic division between professionals and amateurs. For a game said to require, simply, ''a bat, a ball and a wall,'' its lore is rich, and Zug is a good storyteller.
