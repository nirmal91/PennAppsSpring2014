''Can an Outbuilding Be Historic?'' [Jan. 4] may have given the impression that the Glenwood/Glen Head Civic Association opposes development of the property on which the outbuilding stands. Although we prefer preservation, we recognize that this may not be feasible and believe that development, if properly implemented, could improve the area.
However, the proposed site plan raises significant environmental, cultural and aesthetic concerns. The civic association has consistently urged decision-making authorities to insist that these concerns be addressed before the site plan is accepted. Yet, the site plan that has been submitted remains virtually unchanged despite many well documented shortcomings.
In fact, the civic association supports a key feature of the site plan: rezoning the front portion of the property from commercial to residential.
However, we urge a 7,000-square-foot zone consistent with the other homes in the proposed subdivision, as well as with the homes in the adjacent residential neighborhood, rather than the 6,000-square-foot zone that has been requested.
