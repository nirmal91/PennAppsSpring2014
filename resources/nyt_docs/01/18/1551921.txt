To the Editor:
As a Metropolitan Opera violinist who for the last three seasons has been sitting directly in front of the brass section, I must disagree with the assertion by Susan Welty of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra that the trombones are the worst destroyers of a musician's hearing. For me, the most potent weapons of mass aural destruction are the higher-pitched trumpets, especially when blasting a fortissimo passage fortified by the overtones from the French horns and, I must reluctantly add, the poor maligned trombones.
