A giant palace constructed from 27,000 ice blocks will be the highlight of this year's St. Paul Winter Carnival, which begins Thursday. The 240-foot-long Ice Palace -- the first built for the event in 12 years, and the first one since 1941 that visitors will be able to enter -- will feature five turrets; the tallest is nearly eight stories high.
Inside is a courtyard, which features a fountain constructed of ice that emits water and fire alternately, and an ice rink sponsored by the National Hockey League. A sound and light show, best viewed from the courtyard, will run on the half hour nightly.
The St. Paul Winter Carnival runs through Feb. 8 in downtown St. Paul. Other events include the 3M King Boreas Grande Day Parade Jan. 24, the Vulcan Victory Torchlight Parade the night of Jan. 31, and an American Indian powwow Jan. 25.
The Ice Palace, at Cleveland Circle across West Seventh Street from the Xcel Energy Center, will be open 10 a.m. until midnight. Admission is by a ticket included with purchase of a $5 Winter Carnival Button, which offers free or discounted admission to events. Information: (651) 223-4700 or www.winter-carnival.com.
