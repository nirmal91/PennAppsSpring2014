To the Editor:
Over the last 20 years, a very powerful brass section has become a hallmark sound of many American symphony orchestras. Many conductors demand this power, perhaps in the belief that it thrills or impresses audiences. To generate extreme volumes, and win these jobs, American brass players often use larger bore instruments and bigger mouthpieces.
The brass sections of European orchestras generally have a round, balanced sound which does not overpower the strings and winds. And, in fact, very few works call for earsplitting fortissimos.
When music directors begin encouraging a different concept of loud, one that is rich and full and enhances the beauty of the music, then the musicians will strive for sonic quality rather than pure volume. No one will have to wear earplugs.
