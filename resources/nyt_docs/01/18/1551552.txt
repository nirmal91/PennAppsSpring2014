Because of an editing error, a review in the Book Review last Sunday about Nicholas Thomas's ''Cook: The Extraordinary Voyages of Captain James Cook'' included a word substitution that altered the reviewer's meaning. Explaining that Cook would not make an issue about personal property rights with Polynesians but could be inflexible about property belonging to the expedition, the review should have said the distinction was ''lost on Polynesians and sailors alike, who were bemused by his ruthless pursuit of a stolen goat across one island'' -- not ''amused.''
