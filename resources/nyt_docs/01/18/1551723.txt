Having exhausted all of its court appeals, the Town of Islip has announced plans to complete an environmental review for the emergency room opened in April 2001 as part of a new wing of Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.
Neighbors sued the town and the hospital, arguing that if the town had conducted a proper environmental review, it would never have permitted the emergency room to be built on a two-lane residential street. Justice Thomas F. Whelan of State Supreme Court agreed with the neighbors in an October 2002 decision and directed the town's Planning Commission to conduct a more extensive environmental review. The town and hospital appealed.
Last Monday, the State Court of Appeals declined to hear the case, in effect affirming Justice Whelan's decision. Vincent J. Messina, the town attorney, said the emergency room would remain open as long as the hospital worked with the Planning Commission to ''expeditiously continue the environmental review process.''
