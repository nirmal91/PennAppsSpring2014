To the Editor:
Regarding the County Lines column by Marek Fuchs, ''The Hired Hands (at Top Dollar),'' Dec. 21: The topic of professional managers versus elected officials conducting the administration of government is one that has deserved discussion since the turn of the 20th century, when the council/manager approach to government was created as a major reform to address many corrupt activities at the local level.
After all, it has been 100 years since the movement and possibly we need to refresh our knowledge of the council/manager form of government and remind ourselves of the benefits.
Based on the column there is a clear need for revisiting the principles and practices that are associated with the separation of politics from administration.
In its simplest of definitions it can be said that in a council/manager plan ''elected officials do the right thing and managers do things right.''
Although I'm not a flag-waving, super-charged advocate of professional administration, I do think if one is interested, differing forms of government at the local level can be a very exciting topic.
