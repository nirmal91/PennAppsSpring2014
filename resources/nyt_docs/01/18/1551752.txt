Superdelegates -- who include members of the Democratic National Committee, members of Congress, governors and party leaders -- are not bound to vote for a particular candidate and will cast 801 of the 4,321 votes at the Democratic National Convention in July.
The New York Times and CBS News tried to reach all superdelegates identified by the Democratic National Committee to inquire about their presidential preferences. The telephone interviews were conducted Jan. 7-16 with delegates representing 635 votes.
