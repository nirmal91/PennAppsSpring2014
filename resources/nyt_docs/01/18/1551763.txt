To the Editor:
Re ''Cancer 'Prevention' Is Big Seller, but Medical Experts Are Divided'' (front page, Jan. 11):
Only prospective, randomized studies, comparing screened and unscreened populations, can prove that screening saves lives. The ability of screening for prostatic carcinoma by determining levels of prostate-specific antigen or for lung cancer by spiral computer-automated tomography to save lives has not, in fact, been proved.
Such studies have, however, long been completed on mammography for breast cancer and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.
They provide unequivocal evidence that screening for these tumors does indeed save lives.
