To the Editor:
I would like to expand on the coverage of the Millennium Pipeline (''Next Step Weighed on Pipeline,'' Jan. 4). The full impact of the United States Department of Commerce ruling requires the pipeline company to select one of the routes approved by the New York State Department of State. This means that more than Haverstraw Bay is off limits. All areas protected by federal law under the Coastal Zone Act are off limits as well.
This is welcome news to the 7,700 people who depend on Croton's wells for their drinking water as well as for the supporters of the Jane E. Lytle Memorial Arboretum, which would lose 20 percent of its woods and wetlands to a weed-infested utility right of way to the proposed pipeline route.
The Commerce Department's ruling did not address the question of documented need for the natural gas to be supplied by the pipeline. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with reviewing the pipeline company's application, is required to consider the need for the product as well for the applicant's desire for profit. In light of the new multiple and varied energy sources already approved for New York City and its environs, it's questionable that there is a need for the Millennium Pipeline project.
Given that alternate routes for the pipeline may have equally devastating impact on communities that are not participants in the Coastal Zone program, it is critical that the federal regulatory agency document whether the end product justifies the means to deliver it.
