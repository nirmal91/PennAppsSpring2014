Fourth-ranked Connecticut's 69-61 victory over No. 22 Boston College on Saturday was hardly an advertisement for how women's basketball should be played.
''Yeah, it was ugly,'' Diana Taurasi, UConn's senior all-American guard, said. ''I hope we grew up a bit from this.''
UConn guard Ann Strother found another description: ''Gory. That's exactly the word.
''We're in a slump with our confidence,'' she added.
For most of the Huskies' Big East game against Boston College, the capacity crowd of 16,294 at the Hartford Civic Center watched UConn (12-2, 3-1) struggle. In the last two weeks, the Huskies, who won the national championship last year and started this season 9-0, lost to Duke and Notre Dame.
UConn's offense suffered when Boston College (12-3, 2-2) played a 2-3 zone, anchored by two 6-foot-4 players. The Huskies shot erratically and threw errant passes. Their fast break, which had blown open so many games, produced one field goal all game.
At halftime, with UConn leading by 27-24, Coach Geno Auriemma was, as Taurasi put it, ''vocal.''
''He basically challenged us,'' she said. ''He said, 'You've got to fight your way out of the corner or else lay down or take punches to your face.' ''
Early in the second half, UConn took the punches and the Eagles took the lead twice. With 11 minutes 45 seconds left, Taurasi hit a 3-pointer to give UConn a 46-45 lead. That touched off a 12-3 run that should have let UConn win comfortably, but the Huskies could not shake the Eagles.
Guard Ann Strother rose to the moment. Every time Boston College closed in, she countered -- with a 15-foot jumper, a put-back, a 3-pointer from the corner. She finished with 12 points. Barbara Turner led the Huskies with 19 points.
Jesselyn Deveny had 20 points and 6 assists to lead Boston College.
TEXAS TECH 64, BAYLOR 63
Alesha Robertson made three free throws in the final 7.6 seconds and finished with 18 points to lead No. 2 Texas Tech past No. 24 Baylor in Lubbock, Tex. Tech (16-1, 2-1 Big 12) trailed by 4 points with 1:53 left.

VILLANOVA 62, SETON HALL 51
Liad Suez scored 12 of her 19 points in the second half to help No. 19 Villanova overcome a slow start. Host Villanova (13-3, 3-2 Big East) trailed by 22-16 in the first half but used a 9-0 run to take its first lead. Ashley Bush led Seton Hall (10-5, 2-2) with 10 points. (AP)
