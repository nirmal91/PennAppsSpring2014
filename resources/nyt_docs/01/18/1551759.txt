To the Editor:
Re ''Cancer 'Prevention' Is Big Seller, but Medical Experts Are Divided'' (front page, Jan. 11):
The more we learn, the more it becomes clear that a combination of healthy diet, regular physical activity and weight management helps maintain the body's ability to defend itself against chronic diseases like stroke, diabetes, heart disease and -- yes -- cancer.
The idea that this protective effect should extend to the cellular level -- that dietary change can help preserve cell health as much as it helps preserve the health of the heart, brain and lungs -- makes sense.
Fundamental biological pathways are coming to light, and we are learning how individual food components profoundly alter cell functions at the molecular level.
Meanwhile, physiological research is revealing that both physical activity and weight management help prevent a specific set of alterations to the body's hormonal environment -- changes that are consistently associated with increased cancer risk.
