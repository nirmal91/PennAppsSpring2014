To the Editor:
As the grandfather of five under the age of 2 1/2, I know the answer to the question you put to Pete Correll, the chief executive of Georgia-Pacific, the toilet-paper manufacturer in the Business People column (Jan. 4): If 2 percent of Americans don't use toilet paper, what do they use?
The answer is diapers.
