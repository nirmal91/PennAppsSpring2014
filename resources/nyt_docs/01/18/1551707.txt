To the Editor:
Re ''A Land Trust, Wealthy Donors, a Family Farm and a Big Problem'' (Dec. 14, 2003).
I think it unfortunate that the discussions regarding the Town Line Farm Preserve between the Bridgewater Land Trust and the relevant donors have been portrayed by your publication as being an attack on farming or the value of farming. You are missing the real issue here: it is not an issue of donors versus farmers or land trust versus farmers or the future of farming. It is an issue of a charitable organization's compliance with donor intent.
The Bridgewater Land Trust did not acquire the property to ensure that the land would be farmed. The land trust acquired the property to preserve it from development and to ensure that the wide expanse of open space and the vistas would be maintained in perpetuity. It was the donors' support of farming and farmers that encouraged the land trust to retain farming on the property and donor financial support that allowed the land trust to renovate the farmhouse and stabilize the outbuildings. The land trust did so acknowledging and accepting that the donors wanted to make sure that the property was used in a manner that complied with their vision of the property now and in the future.
The donors are not changing their intentions with respect to the property. The Land Trust's board of directors requested clarification and the donors provided it.
All charitable organizations will confirm that if a donor donates funds or property for a specific charitable purpose or expresses their desire that funds or property be used in a certain charitable manner, once the charity accepts the donation unless it is impossible for the charity to follow such request, the charity will comply with donor intent.
