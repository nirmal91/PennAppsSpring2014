JOHN GARDNER
Literary Outlaw.
By Barry Silesky.
Algonquin, $24.95.
For John Gardner, the achievement of literary celebrity was a mixed blessing. During the 1970's four of his philosophical novels were critically acclaimed and also best sellers; one, ''October Light,'' won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1977. He was much esteemed as a generous, inspiring teacher, his admiring students including Charles Johnson and Raymond Carver, and was regarded by friends as magnetic, charismatic, a ''brilliant conversationalist.'' However, ''the more famous he got,'' one friend recalled, ''the more he'd pontificate.'' His characteristic aggressive certitude in his literary judgments became searingly combative. Gardner's heavy drinking intensified and his infidelity ended his second marriage as it had his first. In ''John Gardner: Literary Outlaw,'' the poet Barry Silesky provides a deft portrait of the ''fiery outlaw eccentric,'' an image Silesky says Gardner cultivated. He sensitively traces Gardner's life and the development of his writing. He concludes that Gardner (1933-82) left a body of work that, as he said of good books, helps us ''to know what we believe, reinforces those qualities that are noblest in us, leads us to feel uneasy about our faults and limitations.''
