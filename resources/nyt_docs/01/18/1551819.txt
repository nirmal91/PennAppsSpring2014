THE CANNING SEASON
By Polly Horvath.
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $16.
(Ages 12 and up)
Although the central character in Polly Horvath's latest novel, ''The Canning Season,'' is a girl named Ratchet, the story is really about adults -- careless, thoughtless, struggling adults -- trapped in their own misery. Their actions have left Ratchet stuck with a name her mother gave her to spite her no-good father. Her mother has also taught her to be mortally ashamed of a birthmark on her shoulder blade, and tends not to provide her with food or allow her to make any friends. Then, abruptly, Ratchet is shipped off for the summer to live with her elderly twin relatives, Penpen and Tilly, in the woods of Maine. They're 91 now, still driving, with a phone line that allows incoming but not outgoing calls. They have made a pact to die together whenever the time comes.
They impart all this information kindly but matter-of-factly to Ratchet soon after she arrives. The ladies, one of whom has had a series of heart attacks, live on a farm, which is separated from civilization by a long road frequented by bears, and relish their reputation as the ''queer Menuto women.'' Ratchet and another young outcast, Harper, take on the chores that the sisters really can't handle anymore, like milking the cow, gardening and harvesting and canning blueberries. They form an eccentric household that works better than most. The sisters are failing, but also unfailingly kind to the girls, and the girls help the sisters carry on as best they can, even if that means carting one of them up from the beach in a wheelbarrow. Horvath makes the most of the comic nature of the situation, but the book, which won the 2003 National Book Award for Young People's Literature, is particularly strong because it doesn't shy away from rejection, loss and longing. Pain may give Horvath's characters their shape, but the strong ones don't dwell on it.
