When Sigrid Gabler lived in Washington, D.C., Martin Luther King Day was an opportunity for her family to do things together for the community. In 1994, Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act, encouraging people to celebrate the slain civil rights leader's birthday as a day of service. It was quite a big day there, Ms. Gabler said. One year her family helped paint a mural on the wall of homeless shelter. Another year they bagged sweet potatoes for soup kitchens.
But when Ms. Gabler moved to Montclair two years ago, she said, she was disappointed to discover that the holiday was treated mainly as a day off from school. So last year she organized Rand School, which her daughters attend, to provide takeout lunches for needy people in Montclair. Rand took over for the Salvation Army, which suspends its regular lunchtime program on holidays.
The program will be repeated on Monday, and Ms. Gabler expects to feed about 50 people. On the menu are fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, corn bread, salad, sweet potatoes and consciousness raising. ''The teachers think it's a great opportunity for the kids to learn about service,'' Ms. Gabler said. More than 100 students, parents and teachers from Rand will be involved. At least 25 families will prepare food, and parents chipped in to pay the school custodians to show up on their day off.
The opportunity to serve is being shared by even the school's youngest students.
Third-graders have written poetry, second-graders have been collecting toiletries for the needy and Rand kindergarteners are decorating the brown paper bags for the lunches.
