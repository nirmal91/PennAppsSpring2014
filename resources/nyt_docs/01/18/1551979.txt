The heady scent of garrigue -- sun-baked Mediterranean scrubland -- in the 2001 Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie, a gutsy vin rouge from Corbi√®res, in southwestern France, rebuffs winter. This spicy blend, redolent of macerated cherries, evokes earthenware bowls of cassoulet and afternoons spent rereading Colette. Rosenthal Wine Merchant, 318 East 84th Street (Second Avenue), asks a bargain $11.25.
