The Times Book Review last Sunday carried a review of ''Nehru: The Invention of India,'' by Shashi Tharoor. The reviewer was Ian Buruma. In 1991, Mr. Buruma's novel ''Playing the Game'' was reviewed by Mr. Tharoor in The Washington Post's Book World section.
The Times does not normally assign authors to review each other's books. It was unaware of the background in this case, and the reviewer was unaware of the policy.
