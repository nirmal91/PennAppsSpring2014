To the Editor:
I am all for women's empowerment and for individuals' rights to explore their sexuality with consenting adults. But it seems tasteless and lewd, if not illegal, to do this en masse in quasi-public places with ''invited'' strangers. When the orgies in the gay bathhouses in the 1970's and 80's were written about, at least it was as a cautionary expos√©, not a lifestyle feature! There is a difference between freedom of expression and Sodom and Gomorrah.
No wonder the religious right (all over the world) thinks the United States epitomizes decadence and immorality.
