To the Editor:
I read your Jan. 11 front-page article ''Who Was That Food Stylist? Film Credits Roll On'' with some amusement. I always stay until the end because I want to hear the music and see the music credits.
As a singer who has performed on dozens of movie soundtracks, I want to see the names of my fellow musicians (and in some cases, my own name) and applaud their (our) efforts.
I have to stay until the very end because for some reason, music credits come at the end of a movie, after the caterers, drivers, personal trainers, third assistant director, whoever.
It's astonishing because I truly believe, and I'm sure that others would agree, that a movie's soundtrack is almost like a character in the film and certainly helps convey the emotion of a film.
So there I am, sitting in the movie theater with the lights up, usually alone, while the theater employees are cleaning up the sticky popcorn and sodas all around me.
Until the music credits come earlier, I'll stay until the bitter end.
