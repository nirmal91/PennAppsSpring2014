I was struck by the Rev. Martyn Minns's remark ''I'm trained as a mathematician. Either something is true or it isn't.'' He must know that the truth of a mathematical statement depends on the acceptance of the assumptions from which it is deduced. The same can be said of the truth of a theological statement, and this points up something common to theology and mathematics: both are constructs of the human mind and describe reality imperfectly at best.
