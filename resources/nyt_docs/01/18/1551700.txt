The AP Farms and Family Equestrian Center has received word that it will be forced to leave its 114-acre site in Hopewell Junction in Dutchess County to make room for 54 homes and a shopping center. The farm uses horses for animal-assisted therapy for children and adults.
In the past, the farm owners, Larry Pariseau and Alona Rosse, have worked with the Putnam Valley Catholic Youth Organization. Officials in Putnam County are looking for space to relocate the establishment's 12 to 15 horses.
The preferred site is the Tilly Foster Farm in Southeast, said Vincent Tamagna, a Putnam County legislator, but the New York City Department of Environmental Protection has the final say over any deal there. ''I'd love to see them located in Putnam because it would be a great resource, but the agreement with the D.E.P. by which we took over Tilly Foster Farm only allowed us to have the same number of animals that were there when we sold it,'' Mr. Tamagna said. ''We have 18 there now and AP's horses put us over the top, but we've asked the D.E.P. to bend a little.''
