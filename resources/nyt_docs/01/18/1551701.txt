The White Plains Watch is regrouping, according to its founding editor and publisher, Susan Arterian Chang. After six years covering the local scene and distributing the paper free, the White Plains Watch decided to convert to a $25 yearly subscription. Few people came forward, though, and the monthly paper has suspended publication, starting with the January issue, while Ms. Chang tries to put the paper on a firmer financial footing.
''We're putting our energies into regrouping and trying to publish again,'' Ms. Chang said. Charging a subscription was ''the right move for the paper,'' she said. ''We're committed to community journalism and it's time for people in the community to step up and ensure that we retain our broad base and independence. I've met a lot of people who said, 'I was just about to mail in my subscription.' It's human nature to procrastinate, I understand, but sometimes when people lose something, they realize how much they really value it.''
