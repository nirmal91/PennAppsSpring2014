To the Editor:
Re ''It's Not Heroin, It's the Needle'' (front page, Jan. 11):
It is both interesting and concerning to learn why anyone would oppose a needle exchange program. True, the initial reaction to such a program is that it fosters substance abuse.
But as a health care professional working in Newark, I feel that worrying about a patient's drug addiction is often of secondary concern. Preservation of life and limb is what we are striving for every day.
When a person knowingly will use a potentially dirty needle to get high, isn't it obvious that the incredibly powerful craving for heroin will not be overcome today by preaching abstinence and education?
These are essential tools for the big picture and the long run.
However, so long as the drugs are available (and patients will tell you that access is never the problem), clean needles should be available as well.
In my mind, to deny these patients access to clean needles is more of a crime than the drug use itself.
Just because these citizens may not be our voters and our local business owners does not mean that we shouldn't do the right thing for them.
