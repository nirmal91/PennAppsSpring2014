To the Editor:
This week marks my six-year anniversary of breast cancer, which was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. I am disturbed by the term ''cancer prevention'' (front page, Jan. 11), because it suggests that I could have done something to have escaped getting cancer or at least lowered my risk.
As a competitive runner for the last 28 years, I am an advocate of exercise, good nutrition and appropriate medical tests. It seems that it's more complicated than just that.
