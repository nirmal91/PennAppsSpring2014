Well, a happy new year to you, too. And what a sad one it shall be if the decision to replace What They Were Thinking with your new column, Consumed (Rob Walker, Jan. 4), sets the tone. Now, instead of thoughtful, gentle, often poignant insights, we get to know what people are buying. I think we already get way too much of that.
