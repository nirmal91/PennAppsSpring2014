To the Editor:
In light of the European Union's new regulation on sound exposure for orchestral musicians [''The Shushing of the Symphony'' by James R. Oestreich, Jan. 11], perhaps American students need to start unionizing to procure the same protection. Performers in high school and college marching and concert bands routinely endure sounds in excess of 100 decibels. Enlarged percussion sections, technological improvements in synthetic drum heads and shifts in aesthetic preferences have created snare and bass drum sounds that are tighter and more piercing than ever before. And regarding the culprits from the woodwind section, marching bands routinely field multiple piccolos.
Further, because most school ensembles don't have the luxury of cavernous, acoustically engineered concert halls, they rehearse in small spaces in which the pounding of brass and percussion can be unbearable, if not outright dangerous.
Teenagers are increasingly susceptible to hearing loss, tinnitus and the infrequently mentioned but increasingly experienced condition called hyperacusis, an abnormal sensitivity to loud sounds.
Noise is part of our culture, of course, but we can't be in denial that the super-sizing of sound has outpaced our ears' abilities to process it. By insisting on appropriate rehearsal spaces and encouraging hearing protection when needed (even if it feels uncool), students can make a long-term investment in enjoying the very sounds that now threaten to harm them.
