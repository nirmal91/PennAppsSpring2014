I am perplexed by the essay on the Hamptons. Writers extolling the virtues of life in the Hamptons contributed to the South Fork's popularity, and thus to the decline of the quality of summertime life here. Mr. Edelson of all people should recognize this; he claims to have experienced it firsthand.
As opposed to boasting about how great his new life is on the North Fork, perhaps he should just write himself this little note: Some secrets are worth keeping.
