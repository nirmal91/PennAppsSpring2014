TODAY'S GAMES  AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  Indianapolis Colts (14-4) at New England Patriots (15-2)  3 p.m., CBS
This game figures to be a chess match between Indianapolis's white-hot offense and New England's smothering defense. In their regular-season game, played on the artificial turf at Indianapolis, it did not quite turn out that way, with the Patriots needing a game-ending goal-line stand for a 38-34 victory. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning threw four touchdown passes and rallied his team from a 24-10 halftime deficit. He has been devastating in the Colts' two playoff games, completing 78.6 percent of his passes with eight touchdowns and no interceptions.
What scares the Patriots most is how quickly the Colts can score. Their top priority will be to slow Manning by disrupting his rhythm. Manning has masterly control over his audible system, but the Patriots will use disguises to confuse him and will blitz to hurry him. The last time they played, the Patriots played a two-deep zone defense much of the time to try to take away the big play, hoping to force the Colts to march methodically down the field. The more plays, the more chances the Patriots have to tip a ball. (They had 29 interceptions in the regular season.)
It is difficult to go against this defense, particularly at home. Opponents averaged only 8.5 points at Gillette Stadium this season. The Colts could unleash a no-huddle attack to limit the Patriots' substitutions.
Equally important for the Patriots will be for their offense to go on sustained drives to keep the ball away from Manning. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has also had a superb season, and he rarely makes mistakes. In games played after Nov. 1, he is 26-4 in his career.
If the Patriots can hold off an early Colts push, they can try to run the ball against the Colts' undersized defensive line to control the clock. If not, the scoreboard could look something like a pinball machine.
