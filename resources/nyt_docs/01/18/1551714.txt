To the Editor:
Re ''Towns Are Rejecting No Child Left Behind,'' (Dec. 21).
Many school districts in Connecticut are coming to grips with the disappointing realities of the No Child Left Behind Act: reporting is onerous, penalties are stiff, federal dollars are scarce and the most important standard impacting district compliance with the law is student attendance on testing dates. At the least, given the law's requirements, this is one skill set administrators will be given ample opportunity to develop and demonstrate over the next decade.
Connecticut schools recently reaffirmed their position as the best in the country, and the standards set by the State Department of Education are among the highest in the nation. Ironically, educators in Connecticut and other high-performing states are concerned that the law might actually lead to a lowering of established standards, so states can show more of their students meeting the federally mandated ''annual progress.''
So far, No Child Left Behind has been long on stick and short on carrot. President Bush has failed to release some $6 billion approved by Congress to enable embattled districts to do something besides taking more standardized tests. In the absence of positive incentives or assistance, it would not be surprising to see more districts opt out of the act until it becomes something more than yet another unfunded federal mandate.
