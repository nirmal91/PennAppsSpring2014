At last, 21st-century fashion has arrived, courtesy of the spring collections, and guess what? Dressmaking, not marketing, is the big news. Finally, there are some new clothes that are new, not just thrift-shop revivals. A new international style is emerging, a collaboration between what women think when they think about clothes and the designers who can spin these ideas about femininity into cloth. Categorized here into four major looks, rather like Spice Girls, the main talking points are Volume, Femininity, Sporty Chic and Color. The goddess -- excuse us, the fashion -- is all in the details, the more personalized the better. Are these clothes worth it? Go have a look. If ever there was a season to explore the mind of high fashion, this is it.
William Norwich
From the new chunky wedge to a 50's sundress accessorized with big, fat beads, spring style has substance. Even the pouf has its day.
On the one hand: tweedy, no-nonsense-looking Chanel. On the other: a riot of lace, ruffles, garters and drape by way of Empress Josephine.
The trench coat is the new blazer. The city short is the new mini. The tank top is the new layer. The spectator is the new sneaker.
All the draping, ruffling and flouncing, all the froufrou and all the flou, has the brightest canvas in memory, and that includes eye-popping prints.
