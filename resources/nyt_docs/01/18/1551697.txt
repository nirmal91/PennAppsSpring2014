A bridge on the westbound side of Interstate 95 in Bridgeport is undergoing a partial demolition, despite just being newly built.
The state's Department of Transportation said that workers last month noticed a three-inch sag in a 16-foot-wide portion of the bridge, which goes over State Street. The sagging occurred after concrete was poured on top of steel.
Arthur W. Gruhn, the chief engineer for the D.O.T., said it would take about one month to demolish the section and three months to rebuild it.
''The cause is still under investigation,'' Mr. Gruhn said. ''Once that is determined, then we will determine who is responsible.''
He said he did not know how much the repairs would cost.
The bridge is part of a larger construction project in Bridgeport that is scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2005.
Mr. Gruhn said that similar incidents had occurred on other new bridges, but such cases were rare.
The bridge was a joint effort between Brunalli Construction of Southington and DeMatteo Construction of Springfield, Mass.
