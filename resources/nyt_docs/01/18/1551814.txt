To the Editor:
I was amused to return from church one recent morning and learn from Michael Massing's review of my ''American Jesus'' (Dec. 28) that I had no business being there. If Massing is to be believed, I have somehow magically converted, quite against my will, into a crusading rationalist who shares Thomas Jefferson's ''vision of Jesus'' as nothing more than ''an enlightened Galilean sage.''
On what evidence Massing bases this assessment of my own religious beliefs is unclear, since he does not say and I offer no confession of faith in ''American Jesus.'' Perhaps it is his impression that my book ''almost totally ignores'' born-again Christians, though as any careful reader will observe, evangelicals dominate the first half of the volume. More likely it is the fact that I bend over backward to give Jefferson a fair shake.
Massing seems to confuse my method of bracketing my faith -- an approach I share with virtually all my colleagues in religious studies -- with a lack of the same. The fact that he takes me to be a Jefferson lover only testifies in my view to my success in applying that method, since, truth be told, I personally find it difficult to be anything other than snide when it comes to Jefferson's absurdly ahistorical Jesus.
But who cares which Jesus warms my heart? If you think your readers do, why not suss out ''Prothero's own Jesus'' via instruments less blunt than one reviewer's overactive imagination? (When asked by other newspapers which American Jesus I favored, I stated quite clearly my preference for the ''Black Moses'' of African-American churches.) In any case, I would request that you refrain from attributing to me theological positions I do not hold.
