To the Editor:
Re: ''It's Not the Heroin, It's the Needle'' (Jan. 11): It is distressing that life-and-death decisions are made by legislators who reject consistent, unequivocal, empirical evidence and rely instead on dogma and what is heard when you go out on your own volition and talk to drug dealers. All Americans, including legislators, have the right to believe anything they want, but when those beliefs contribute directly to one of the most horrendous epidemics of our age, it is a shameful violation of the obligations that go with elected office.
