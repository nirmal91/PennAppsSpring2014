Woody Guthrie walked a ribbon of highway and saw above him an endless skyway. Not me. I ate at a South Kearny diner and saw above me the Pulaski Skyway. Since opening in 1969, the New Skyway Diner (new because it replaced an old train-car diner) has proudly sat just off Truck Route 1 and 9 North and just underneath the Pulaski.
Understand that this is not the place to bring the children after a soccer game. That is, unless you recently traded in your minivan for an 18-wheeler. Smoking and drinking are favored activities of the Skyway's trucking clientele. As the signage clearly states, ''We do not have a nonsmoking section.'' The brick-and-stone exterior has served as a shooting locale, literally, for ''The Sopranos.'' Christopher was gunned down outside the diner in the second season.
Still, this diner may come as a pleasant surprise. For it is a clean, well-run establishment where you can order a solid, reasonably priced meal at any hour. Dark faux-wood paneling dominates the d√©cor, giving the diner a cozy feel. Aqua booth cushions, white wood-grain Formica table tops, ceiling fans, neon beer signs and hanging plants complete the scene. Between the booths and two counter areas, there is room for about 100 patrons.
The menu doesn't veer far from classic diner fare, offering breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, dinner entrees, daily specials and homemade desserts. At the low end, a cup of soup costs $1.80. At the high end, a broiled T-bone steak with onion rings will run you $18.95. My grilled chicken sandwich ($4.95) was moist. A generous plate of fries ($3.25) drenched in brown gravy and smothered in melted American cheese was beautiful or grotesque, depending on your perspective. I am of the beautiful persuasion.
