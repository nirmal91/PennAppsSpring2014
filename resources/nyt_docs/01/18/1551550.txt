Just as there are modes of play that conceal ambition, because they seem to show a tepid approach, as though holding out an olive branch, there are those that look so aggressive that they seem on the verge of exploding at any minute, and the game is decided with a roll of a bomb. But remember that both types of opponent have the same objective -- you as a trophy. The one demonstrates that mild-looking snails are dangerous and, if they can take you in, will sneak victories in the style of Anatoly Karpov. Don't offer them a draw; they want none of it.
Their aggressive counterparts present their own enigmas: are they all loaded to the hilt with a refutation of the latest insight, or are they just rolling the dice? In the game between the grandmasters Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark and Vasilios Kotronias of Greece in Round 8 of the Hastings International Tournament at the Horntye Sports Center, in Hastings, England, Nielsen was spooked by his opponent's possible rejoinder to 27 Nc7!?, namely 27 . . . Qg6!?, and backed off.
Kotronias bored in with a powerful attack that got him the game. He tied for first place with the Scottish grandmaster Jonathan Rowson, each scoring 6-3 in the 10-player round robin, held Dec. 28 to Jan. 5.
Development with 6 Be2 brings about the main line of the King's Indian Defense. With 6 . . . e5 7 O-O Nc6, Black puts it up to his opponent to make a decision about the center. White cannot maintain the tension with 8 Be3 because after Najdorf's 8 . . . Re8 9 d5 Nd4! 10 Nd4 ed 11 Bd4 Ne4 12 Bg7 Kg7, the game has a sterile equality. So there is the sharp 8 d5, which leads, after 8 . . . Ne7 9 Ne1 Nd7 10 Be3 f5, to attacks by Black against the white king, and by White on the queenside.
After 19 b4, Black must not play 19 . . . ab because that only paves the way for 20 Bb4 followed by 21 a5. The one who gets the open lines wins this kind of game.
After 21 c5, Kotronias had no interest in 21 . . . dc 22 Rc1 Nd7 23 Nd3 Ngf6 24 Nc5 Nc5 25 Rc5 Ne8 with advantage to White.
With 25 . . . g4!?, Kotronias got the breakthrough he had strived so mightily for, but Nielsen struck back with 26 Ba5!?
After 26 Ba5, then 26 . . . Qa5 27 Rc8 gh 28 Nh3 Kg8 29 Ra8 Qa8 30 Ra1 Nd7 31 a5 is winning for Nielsen. But after 26 . . . Qe8, he did not play 27 Nc7, suddenly worried about stopping 27 . . . Qg6 28 Na8 gh 29 Nh3 Qg2 mate.
Nielsen's 33 g3 proved to be no shield against Kotronias's depredations. After 33 . . . Ne3! 34 Be3 Rg3 35 Kf2 Rg2 36 Kf3 Rc2 37 Rc2 Qh4, Nielsen stood about even in material but could not integrate his forces against a predatory queen.
After 40 . . . Bh6!, 41 Bh6 would have encountered 41 . . . Qh2, and Nielsen loses one rook or the other. But 41 Bb6 was no better -- after 41 . . . Re4, Nielsen could not avoid further loss of material and gave up.
