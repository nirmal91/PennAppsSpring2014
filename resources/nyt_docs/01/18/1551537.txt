Over the last eight years, housing prices have risen 35 percentage points more than the rate of inflation, on average. Such figures are prompting talk about whether the housing market is in a bubble like the one that inflated stock prices.
In New England, housing prices rose 59.6 percentage points above inflation from 1995 to 2003, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. (Its data may even understate the increase because they exclude housing with mortgages of $320,000 or more.)
But in some expensive housing markets, including San Francisco and Seattle, rental prices are now falling, which may be a sign of weak demand.
The Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit group in Washington, has been sounding warnings about a housing bubble. But it wants to know what other people think, so it is holding an essay contest. A $1,000 prize will go to the person who, in 750 words or less, makes the best case that there is no housing bubble.
In announcing the contest, the center said that ''it took nothing more than simple arithmetic to recognize the existence of the stock market bubble'' in 1998 to 2000, because stock prices were rising far faster than corporate profits or dividends.
Those who say there is no housing bubble have argued that housing prices are up because of immigration, limited supplies of urban land, environmental rules that limit construction and the rising incomes of buyers. The center's economists say that they do not believe that, but that they want to see if anyone can persuade them otherwise.
Essays may be sent before the March 31 deadline to georges@cepr.net. The winning essay will be posted at www.cepr.net on April 6.
