To the Sports Editor:
As an almost 9-year-old Yankees fan, I am really, really angry about Roger Clemens's decision. He dumped all Yankees fans, and now all Yankees fans should dump him. He did not keep his word, after all the things the Yankees did for him. All Yankees fans should feel betrayed by him. Maybe he would not have gone if Andy Pettitte had not left first, but Clemens still made his own decision. I would rather have him retire than go to the Astros. The only chance we might have to see him is in the World Series, which I definitely don't want. He is too good!
