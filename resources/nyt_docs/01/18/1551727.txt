Re ''Suozzi's 'New Suburbia': Now Comes the Hard Part'' (Jan. 11):
Tom Suozzi may have improved some of the fiscal wrongdoings of past administrations, but the looks of Nassau County have suffered. In 20 years as a resident of Nassau County, I have never seen it dirtier. Now, all I see are bottles, garbage and debris of all types littering our highways.
I moved to Nassau 20 years ago to the ''old suburbia,'' which was cleaner and welcoming. I am truly embarrassed and disgusted by how our environment is (not) kept. We deserve to have better services.
Mr. Suozzi, stop fixing the inside of the house at the expense of the outside. The outside repairs will preserve our house values, our feelings about our neighborhoods and our quality of life.
