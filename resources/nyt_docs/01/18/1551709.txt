To the Editor:
The article incorrectly framed the debate over the Town Line Farm as one borne of farm versus nonfarm interests and related socio-economic differences. A more objective investigation of this discussion would have revealed that the real issues in this debate are self interest and the Bridgewater Land Trust's obligation to honor the explicit and implicit commitments it made to the donors at the time it accepted our donations.
Many of the author's assertions were based on a document that did not reflect the donors' statement of donor intent that was submitted at the land trust's request on Nov. 3, 2003, which made several of the more substantive points raised in the article moot. Importantly, the author failed to speak to several of the parties that I believe to be relevant in this debate: the members of the land trust active in the negotiations at the time of the donation (the current president of the land trust became president in June).
Land preservation, land trusts and farming are all vital initiatives, which my family and I believe in fervently. Neither the land trust nor the donors have benefited from this controversy. In my opinion a more thorough and balanced investigation of the facts is essential to understanding the context, the origins and the drivers of this unfortunate controversy.
