Express E-ZPass lanes opened last Sunday at Interchange 18W on the New Jersey Turnpike, following installation last month of the first such high-speed toll-collection lanes, at Pascack Valley Toll Plaza on the Garden State Parkway. The new lanes, which allow vehicles to pass through at speeds of 55 miles per hour, are part of a $45 million program to alleviate traffic congestion by installing Express E-ZPass at six sites statewide by the summer of 2005. Each express lane is expected to process almost 2,200 cars an hour, nearly double the volume of regular E-ZPass lanes, which require cars to slow to 15 m.p.h.
