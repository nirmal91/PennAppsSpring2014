A table from Morningstar Inc. last Sunday in the Mutual Funds Report, Part 2 of this section, listing the best- and worst-performing funds in many categories through the fourth quarter of 2003, included some incorrect entries.
In the categories for worst performers, eight funds were listed erroneously. They were Value Line Leveraged Growth Investors, Columbia Asset Allocation Class G, MFS Global Total Return, GMO Emerging Country Debt Share Class III, Morgan Stanley Institutional International Fixed-Income, Western Asset Non-U.S. Opportunity Bond Portfolio, SEI International Emerging Markets Debt Class A and Dreyfus Premier Short-Intermediate Municipal Bond Class D.
(In addition, Value Line Leveraged Growth Investors should not have appeared in a chart on the front page of the Mutual Funds Report, listing the worst-performing diversified stock funds for the fourth quarter.)
In categories for best performers, 12 funds were omitted. They were BlackRock Small Cap Growth Institutional, U.S. Global Investors Global Resources, U.S. Global Investors World Precious Minerals, U.S. Global Investors Gold Shares, U.S. Global Investors China Region Opportunity, Scudder Gold and Precious Metals Class S, Loomis Sayles High Income Institutional Shares, Nations Convertible Securities Primary A, Nicholas-Applegate Convertible Class I, Oppenheimer Limited Term Municipal Bond Class A, Oppenheimer Rochester National Municipals Class A and Vanguard Florida Long-Term Tax-Exempt Investor Shares. (One fund, CGM Capital Development, was omitted from the front-page chart listing the five best-performing diversified stock funds for the quarter.)
A corrected table appears today, on Page 6.
