To the Editor:
Re ''The Governor Apologizes, but Many Say It's Too Late,'' (Jan. 11).
The article on Governor Rowland's situation is indeed reflective of prevailing sentiment in the state.
Mr. Rowland's televised speech to the state demonstrated a remarkable inability to sense the anger of our citizens. He seems unable to internalize that we are outraged by both his overt acts and his toleration of the corruption pervading his administration. Apologies cannot undo a pattern of malfeasance in his lack of responsiveness to the public trust.
Now the state must face the need to entertain an impeachment and the strong possibility of federal intervention to reset the course in Hartford. These developments will paralyze the public's business and air our laundry nationally.
The governor might consider that his stepping down would be responsive to our disappointment and perhaps mitigate what will likely be a very unpleasant experience for all of us.
