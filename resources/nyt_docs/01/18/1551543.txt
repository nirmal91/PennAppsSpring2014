To the Editor:
In ''The Retro City'' (Jan. 4): Michael Johns argues that the old city has become a kind of boutique adjunct to suburbia. Indeed many recent urban ''infill'' projects now feel as contrived as suburban master-planned communities.
Yet the vibrant city of the 1950's that Mr. Johns so fondly recalls survives in an altered form in emergent cities that I call boomburbs. These are overgrown postwar suburbs that have evolved to become among the more interesting and authentic parts of the metropolis.
Maturing suburbs from Anaheim, Calif., to Hialeah, Fla., have become big cities complete with large foreign-born populations and funky neighborhoods. The sprit of the 50's city lives, but it is now more often found in an aging boomburb strip mall than in a gentrified downtown.
