Essays From France, 1925-1939.
By Joseph Roth.
Norton, $24.95.
In the virtuoso collection of short pieces ''What I Saw: Reports From Berlin, 1920-1933,'' Joseph Roth provides us with a magnificent window into a world busily reshaping itself into the nationalist behemoth soon to be known as Nazi Germany. A companion volume of sorts, ''Report From a Parisian Paradise: Essays From France, 1925-1939'' (superbly translated from the German by Michael Hofmann), offers up a very different yet equally affecting vision of European society: the hopeful, Romantic face of a writer best known for his dark, melancholy prose and his admittedly ''skeptical intelligence.'' A respected journalist for the Frankfurter Zeitung, Roth left Germany for France in 1925, establishing himself in Paris and joyfully leaving behind what he believed to be the burdensome constraints of a German world that worships literal truth and ''mistrusts the undefined.'' Roth found Paris, unlike Berlin, to be ''free, open, intellectual in the best sense, and ironic in its magnificent pathos.'' His meandering path south through the country, reporting on the people he meets and the places he sees, led him to the ''perfectly clear -- like glass'' air of Les Baux, the humanity of Marseilles and the seductive beauty of Avignon. It also led him to the more familiar, darker places in his soul, a paradox ensuring that Roth's journalistic writing never loses its extraordinary psychological depth. In ''Bullfight on Sunday,'' Roth watches as an exhausted bull in the arena at NÃ®mes faces the gate ''behind which, he knows, is the good, warm, protective shed, redolent of home.'' Like Roth, who struggled all of his life with his own debilitating sense of homelessness and who finally drank himself to death in 1939 at the age of 45, the bull understands that he has been defeated and simply ''stands where he is and no longer hopes.''
