In an effort to unify a party divided by a hard-fought presidential primary campaign, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Saturday that he would bring together the party's presidential candidates and former presidents at a dinner in March.
The chairman, Terry McAuliffe, said that former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter had accepted and that he expected to have all 10 candidates who have run for the party's 2004 nomination at the dinner, which is set for March 25 in Washington.
Mr. McAuliffe said he was announcing the plan just before the Iowa caucuses as a signal that the party would eventually unite. He said he was confident a nominee would emerge by late March.
''This will give people hope we're going to be together at some point soon,'' Mr. McAuliffe said in Michigan, where he was on party business. He said that the dinner, expected to raise millions, would come at the end of a two-day organizing session that would also include a ribbon-cutting for the party's new national headquarters near Capitol Hill.
