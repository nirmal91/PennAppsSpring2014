To the Editor:
Re the Jan. 11 front-page article about the new market for cancer ''prevention'' services:
The general public understands prevention to mean keeping something -- like cancer -- from occurring. Yet hospital prevention centers are offering steps that, at best, can reduce the risk of developing cancer and, at worst, have no relationship to prevention at all. Neither screening for cancer nor testing for a genetic predisposition will keep anyone from getting cancer.
Financing research is one thing. Keeping people from getting sick is another. Real cancer prevention will require not clinical advances, but understanding what in the environment -- both personal and social -- is causing cancer, and making policy changes to eliminate those causes.
