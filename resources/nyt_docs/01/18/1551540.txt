For now, at least, many Americans no longer go into a cold sweat before ripping open their 401(k) statements. But, yes, if it isn't one thing it's  another. Just as nest eggs plump up again, health costs chip away at them.
According to a survey of 408 large companies by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 10 percent said they had scrapped subsidized benefits for future  retirees in the past year, and 20 percent plan to do so within three years.
Even when coverage survives, it may be whittled back, as many companies vow to increase premiums, deductibles and co-payments. (The survey was conducted before the Medicare drug legislation was passed, but only time will tell how  that works.) Often, changes apply mainly to new workers, so the message seems to be: Stay put.
