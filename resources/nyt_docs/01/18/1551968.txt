By most measures prospects for George W. Bush's re-election look very good. No single indicator guarantees a second term, of course, but on balance the president's numbers are as good if not better than those of the three presidents who won second terms in recent times.
From a political standpoint, Mr. Bush is strong. His approval ratings are relatively high, as is the percentage of Americans who think the country is on the right track, and alone among recent presidents he saw his party gain seats in the midterm elections.
The economic numbers are also positive. Consumer confidence is high, disposable income is rising and the unemployment rate is lower than that of the three presidents who lost bids for re-election.
Yet the numbers, as always, don't tell the full story. The effects of partisan polarization, for example, are unpredictable, and it is near an all-time high; Democrats disapprove of Mr. Bush almost as much as Republicans disapproved of President Bill Clinton. What's more, news that seems to be good -- like rising approval ratings -- doesn't always lead to re-election, while news that seems to be bad -- like relatively high unemployment -- doesn't necessarily ruin an incumbent's chances. Just ask Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan.
These statistics have been culled from publicly available sources, including the Gallup Organization, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the University of Michigan, and Congressional Quarterly and other news organizations.
