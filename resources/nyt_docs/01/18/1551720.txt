To the Editor:
The article ''Will Nice Old Building Finish Last?'' (Jan. 4) about a major development proposal for downtown White Plains, doesn't do much for The New York Times's reputation for fairness and clarity.
The subjective emphasis on what the reporter may consider the ''human interest'' aspect of the project, to the virtual exclusion of all else, does little to enlighten and clarify. The graphics shown do not represent the situation fairly. A descriptive location and site plan would have contributed greatly to readers' understanding. Readers are owed an orderly factual exposition, including the observations of other, perhaps more objective, participants in what has been an extensive planning process. They would then be provided with historical context for the current planning ''strains'' as well as for their potential resolution.
