and Why It Is Necessary to Give.

To give to someone you do not know and to do so anonymously ranks far higher than giving to a poor person after he asks you for money, according to Moses ben Maimon, the 12th-century physician, philosopher and scholar known as Maimonides and by Jewish scholars as Rambam. Julie Salamon ponders this hierarchy of giving, pointing out that the root of the Hebrew word for charity, ''tzedakah,'' means ''justice,'' and that according to Rambam (as she refers to him) a truly just society sees to the needs of its poor while protecting them from feeling shame. Measured by this standard, we fall short of the ideal when we let a homeless person on the street approach us for help before we offer it to him -- never mind how far we fall when we outright refuse. In brief anecdotes, ''Rambam's Ladder'' details the sometimes sticky conundrums involved with giving, whether by the man on the street or by foundations. Salamon, who writes about the arts for The New York Times, shows that Maimonides' articulation of a literal hierarchy -- like the Jewish law from which he draws -- seeks to make concrete and accessible those ancient ideals concerning our responsibility to others in the world.
