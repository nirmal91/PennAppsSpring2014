In the summer of 2002, when I was a 45-year-old single woman with a hankering for a diamond ring, I decided that I shouldn't have to wait until I married (if ever I did) to get one.
So I bought a beautiful Edwardian diamond that I wear on my right hand. It's a bit of beauty that I put on every morning, lifting my spirits. Who knew I would be a ''trendsetter'' -- a year before the advertising campaign?
