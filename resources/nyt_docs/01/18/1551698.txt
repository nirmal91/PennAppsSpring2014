Experts at the University of Rhode Island have begun analyzing how to best preserve the town of Stonington's battle flag, which historians say dates back to the late 18th century.
A team from the school's Textile Conservation Laboratory, led by Dr. Margaret T. Ordonez, removed the 9 by 16 foot woolen flag from its display case in the Fleet Bank branch on the town's Cannon Square on Jan. 10. The team is determining what type of processes would be suitable by analyzing the soil on the flag and the condition of its fibers.
''One option would be to preserve it as is with its historic damage,'' said Dr. Ordonez, who estimated that the process could cost more than $10,000 and take nearly a year. ''The other would be to put a backing behind it, with red, white and blue in the appropriate places, so you can see how it looked in its original state.''
According the town's historical society, the flag was flown by a unit of volunteers at a place called the grasshopper fort, as it fought off the British Fleet in the three-day Battle of Stonington in 1814. With 16 stars and 16 stripes, the flag was made my members of a local church sometime after Tennessee was admitted to the Union in 1796.
''I think it's of historical importance, partly because it's an unusual flag and partly because it is associated with the same period in which Francis Scott Key wrote ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' said James Boylan, the society's president.
Mr. Boylan said it is believed that a veteran of the battle held onto the tattered flag for 50 years, before it was passed along to other residents and finally the society, which has displayed it in what was originally known as the Ocean Bank Building since 1949.
The historical society plans to raise money to cover the cost of the preservation. Mr. Boylan said federal money might also be available.
It has not been decided where the flag will be permanently displayed after it is preserved.
