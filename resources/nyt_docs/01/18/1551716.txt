To the Editor:
Regarding ''A Premium Steak, at a Premium Price'' (Dining Out, Dec. 28):
I read Alice Gabriel's review of the Flames Steak House with curiosity and puzzlement. Though she gave the place a ''Good'' rating, one could sense a negative undertone in the body of the review. From the opening sentence ''I took a chance '' to ''bad art,'' I got a feeling that something more than food and the restaurant was being reviewed: the most egregious part is that ''while the meat is good, such prices are just not justified.''
It is obvious that Ms. Gabriel did not consider the capital investment to dry-age beef for 28 days, the labor intensive process and the general beef market in 2003 (beef prices are the highest they have been in many years).
As a carnivore, a Westchester resident and a restaurateur, I have tried most of the restaurants in the county that serve steak; none of them serve anything comparable to the porterhouse at the Flames.
In 2003 I went to the Flames about a dozen times without a single disappointment in the 28-day dry-aged porterhouse, done to perfection (medium rare).
