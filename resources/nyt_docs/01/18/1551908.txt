Carnival, Quebec City's annual winter festival, celebrates its 50th anniversary this February, and the city is gearing up for more than two weeks of snowy fun. The celebration stretches from Jan. 30 to Feb. 15, but the city's lures -- its well-preserved 16th- and 17th-century architecture, fine restaurants and outdoor activities -- last all winter long.
With the right clothes, being outside in Quebec in winter is a pleasure. Free outdoor ice rinks play romantic music, wide boardwalks offer views of the St. Lawrence River, and outdoor vendors sell hot drinks, snow-hardened maple syrup toffee and the hot deep-fried batter treats called Beaver Tails.
The cold weather and gentle climbs along the sloping streets and staircases that link the old Lower and the populous Upper Towns justify indulging in rich, multicourse meals that might start with Quebec foie gras and finish with creamy local cheeses. Warm hotels, cafes and bars beckon, offering oversize fireplaces and snowy views from double-glazed windows.
Events
A Carnival pass (shaped like the Bonhomme, Carnival's red-hatted snowman mascot) costs about $5.55, at $1.31 Canadian to the U.S. dollar, and allows entry to most activities. It's sold at Carnival sites and many local stores. Full details and schedules are at www.carnaval.qc.ca.
Many Carnival activities take place on the Plains of Abraham, a 268-acre park where French and English forces clashed in the 1759 battle that spelled the end of New France. During the festival, it becomes the bustling Place Desjardins, with a snow palace, a sugar shack offering maple syrup treats and a children's area with games, an ice maze and live entertainment. Fans of tabletop soccer (foosball) will want to try a life-size version of the game, in which trios of players are yoked together on metal poles, shuffling in pursuit of the ball. Visitors can also ice-fish for trout or go snow rafting (think large-scale tobogganing on circular inflatable rafts).
Armed with chainsaws and chisels, artists from around the world compete in the International Snow Sculpture Competition starting Jan. 30 at Place Desjardins. The imaginative sculptures glow colorfully under lights at night.
A dog agility competition at Place Desjardins on Feb. 14 at 9 a.m. bills itself as the world's only such competition on a snowy course.
At another Carnival site, Place Loto-Québec, across from the Parliament buildings, colored lights shimmer on more than 6,000 bricks of ice in the huge, graceful Ice Palace of Bonhomme. At Place Hydro-Québec, in Place D'Youville, just outside the city walls, actors in 19th-century costumes bring to life a re-creation of an old market square. It's also the site of the opening ceremony, with music and fireworks, on Jan. 30 at 7 p.m.
A noisy, festive dog sled race, La Grande Virée, is run Jan. 31 at 1 p.m. over 3.7 miles of city streets, from the Château Frontenac to the Plains of Abraham and back.
Night parades held Feb. 7 and 14 at 7 p.m. attract more than a half-million spectators to watch the procession of brightly lighted floats, clowns and marching bands. The first parade takes place in the Charlesbourg neighborhood, from the Boulevard Henri-Bourassa to the Rue Duval. The second, in the Upper Town, winds from the Avenue Grand-Allée down the Avenue Honoré-Mercier and the Boulevard René-Lévesque to the Avenue Cardinal-Rouleau.
Contestants in the International Canoe race, on Feb. 8, cross the two-mile-wide St. Lawrence through ice floes and strong currents.
Outside of the festival, the Musée de la Civilisation, 85, rue Dalhousie in the Lower Town, is showing ''Gratia Dei: A Journey Through the Middle Ages,'' through March 28. It explores the Catholic Church's influence on peasantry, cities, public institutions and scientific development with paintings, manuscripts and everyday items like coins and dishes. Through next Jan. 4, the exhibition ''Astérix and the Romans'' uses the adventures of the French comic book character Astérix as a way into the artifacts, history and politics of the Roman empire circa 50 B.C. General admission is $5.55, free on Tuesday. Closed Monday. Information: (418) 643-2158 or at www.mcq.org.
The Musée d'Art Inuit Brousseau, at 39, rue St.-Louis, showcases the art and culture of the Canadian Inuit. The 500 artifacts on permanent display include tools, carvings and prints from prehistoric to modern times. The exhibit ''Women Artists'' runs through March. Open daily; admission, $4.75. Information: (418) 694-1828 or www.inuitart.ca.
Sightseeing
When Carnival ends, outdoor activities continue. Outside the Château Frontenac looms Glissades de la Terrasse, (418) 692-2955, a famous 500-foot ice-coated toboggan run. Rides cost $1.60, or $1 under age 6. Open daily 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
A few steps away on Terrasse Dufferin, the Funiculaire, (418) 692-1132, a glass elevator, has offered panoramic transportation between the Upper and Lower Towns for 125 years. It is wheelchair accessible and runs from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; $1.20 each way.
The Ice Hotel, (877) 505-0423, www.icehotel-canada.com, is 30 minutes west of Quebec at the Station Touristique Duchesnay in Ste.-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier. This year's version is a high-ceilinged, 32-room palace constructed from 12,000 tons of snow and 400 tons of ice. Overnight stays start at about $425, with dinner and breakfast for two. But for $11 visitors can tour the rooms, bar, chapel, movie theater, grand hall and ice sculpture galleries. Open daily until April 4 (weather permitting). Dog sledding, cross-country skiing, and other activities are available nearby. Packages including a shuttle bus from downtown Quebec and admission to the hotel cost $32 from Sherpa Plein Air at (877) 640-7437.
Quebec City is full of small, boutique-lined neighborhoods, some which play up their historic charm. The Quartier Petit Champlain in the Lower Town is a beautiful warren of narrow streets and hidden staircases accessible down the l'Escalier Casse-Cou - the Breakneck Staircase -- along the Côte de la Montagne to the Rue Petit-Champlain. The neighborhood, dating back to the 1600's, houses galleries, souvenir shops and ''economuseums,'' studio-galleries where visitors can watch artists at work.
Nearby is the Place-Royale, a market square restored to resemble its 17th-century heyday. Artifacts and historical and child-friendly multimedia exhibits are on display at the Centre d'Interprétation de Place-Royale, 27, rue Notre-Dame, (418) 646-3167. Admission, $3.20. Closed on Monday until June 23.
In the pleasingly ungentrified antiques district on the Rue St.-Pierre and the Rue St.-Paul in the Old Port, dozens of small shops sell old furniture, books, photographs and jewelry. They include Les Beautés d'Autrefois, 152, rue St.-Paul, (418) 692-3719, with several fine Edison record players, and Boutique à la Capucine, 145, rue St.-Paul, (418) 692-5318, with religious iconography and a great selection of old postcards.
