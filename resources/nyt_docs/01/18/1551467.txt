Bo Jackson, the football star turned entrepreneur, will spend Super Bowl Sunday in an unlikely location -- a military base in either Iraq or Kuwait.
At the end of this month, Mr. Jackson and three executives from N'Genuity Enterprises, the Scottsdale, Ariz., company of which he is co-owner, will head to a location that will not be disclosed in advance. They are taking more than 200,000 pounds of the company's food products, which include Bo-Tisserie chicken and Bo-Burgers.
They will spend four days visiting troops and hold a party for the Super Bowl, broadcast live via satellite. ''I just want the troops to know that everybody is rooting for them,'' Mr. Jackson said.
As to whom he'll be rooting for to make it to the big game, Mr. Jackson, the former Oakland Raider, was surprisingly blas√©.
''The Raiders stink this year,'' he said. ''Since they're not going to be in it, I guess it really doesn't matter.''
