To the Editor: Being a vanity plate owner myself, I admit to perusing the plates of others for my own interest and amusement.
My license plate is ''NOPAIN.'' I have had the plate for more than two decades. I have been practicing and teaching anesthesiology at Yale University School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Hospital for over a quarter-century. I was quite surprised that no one had requested the plate before I had.
As an aside, I had the matching plate on my BMW motorcycle from 1981 until I sold it several years ago. In the late 1970's, my marker was ''BNSURG'' representing the role I played in the National Guard as a battalion surgeon.
