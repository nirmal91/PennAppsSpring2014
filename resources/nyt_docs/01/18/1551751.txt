To the Sports Editor:
Isiah Thomas may be Detroit's greatest gift to New York since Dave DeBusschere. It's unfortunate that Donald Fine (Mailbox, Jan. 10) is so obsessed with Thomas's comment about Larry Bird and Thomas's bad pass. Thomas-bashers conveniently forget that just before that, Thomas made the shot that put Detroit ahead.
As for the comment, it was made as a joke. It was in bad taste, but in this day and age, that's hardly unique.
