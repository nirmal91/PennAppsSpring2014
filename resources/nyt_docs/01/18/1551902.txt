For golfers who let their game lie fallow during the long winter, an Arctic tune-up may be just the ticket. The Great Canadian Travel Company is offering an all-inclusive package to the World Ice Golf Championship in Greenland, March 23 to 29.
An 18-hole course is chiseled out of ice on a fjord near Uummannaq, a remote island community of 3,000 Inuit off Greenland's west coast. If the fjord is not frozen solid, the tournament is held on a lake by the town. Participants must have a handicap of 18 or less. Sealskin suits, which can be rented for $131 for three days, are recommended because the temperature ranges from 23 to minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit.
The balls are painted fluorescent orange so they can be spotted on the frozen fairways. No sand traps or water hazards to worry about, but that hummock in the distance might be a polar bear's back, and the greens (or, in this case, the whites) are ice-covered. The weeklong $6,090 tour, which includes air fare from Ottawa, includes a five-night stay (in double occupancy) at the Hotel Uummannaq, as well as all meals, travel transfers and ''whites'' fees. Optional activities include ice-fishing and a dog-sled ride.
