To the Editor:
What a discouraging thing to find in your Sunday paper: ''Parties Where an ID Is the Least of What You Show'' (Jan. 11) -- over 33 column inches, six enticing color photos, dominating Sunday Styles. A kind of reportage on the sex party scene, a glamorous guide to what clueless young women think is empowering. Women exploited by women.
This is so far from what we early feminists had in mind back when a lot of us thought there was a way to make something more humane out of this culture. We wanted women to have a life. Instead, they have been tricked into believing they want ''the lifestyle.''
