In ''The Doll People,'' Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin introduced readers to the antique and modern dolls living with the sisters Kate and Nora Palmer. The sequel, ''The Meanest Doll in the World,'' is unfortunately not quite as good. The authors pile on the action, crank up the volume, and load their story with lessons that make it feel a bit pedantic. Returning late from a nighttime expedition to the attic of 26 Wetherby Lane, Annabelle (antique) and Tiffany Funcraft (plastic) duck into Kate's backpack to avoid being seen moving about one morning, only to find themselves zipped in and carried off to school. There Tiffany boldly decides to explore, and soon both dolls are scampering down corridors and peeking into classrooms. The real problems start when they scramble inside the wrong backpack at the end of the day and are transported to a strange home, where they encounter a princess doll with a lavender crown who is out to rule dollkind.
