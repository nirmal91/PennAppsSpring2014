You have experienced San Francisco on foot, ferry and cable car. A new business makes it easier for sporty visitors to explore the city's shoreline by kayak. City Kayak rents and launches the craft on San Francisco's bayside waterfront. From its South Beach location, a number of sights are within a 30-minute paddle, including the Bay Bridge, the Ferry Building and Pacific Bell Park, home of the Giants.
According to Ted Choi, City Kayak's owner, who has kayaked on the bay for 15 years, evening trips are especially popular.
Single kayaks rent for $15 an hour, and two-person tandem kayaks for $25. The fee includes wet suit, booties, flotation device, paddle and marine radio, as well as a towel and a warm place to change after the trip. Also included are a pretrip briefing on tides, currents and maritime traffic lanes, and instruction in paddling and self-rescue for less-experienced kayakers; guided tours available.
City Kayak is at Pier 38 on the Embarcadero. Information: (415) 357-1010 or www.citykayak.com.
