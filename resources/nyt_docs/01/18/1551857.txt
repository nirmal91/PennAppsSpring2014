By implying a difference that doesn't exist between Milosevic and Saddam, many Democrats have forfeited moral clarity on their former strong suit, human rights. If Iraq was a ''Level 2'' security issue, Kosovo was hardly even that high. I have yet to hear any Democrat who is a dove on Iraq but was a hawk on the Balkans satisfactorily put forth any moral or legal difference between the interventions, both without initial United Nations approval, to oust the Butcher of Belgrade and to oust the Butcher of Baghdad.
The appearance is one of confusion and partisanship.
