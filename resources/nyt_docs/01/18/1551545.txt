To the Editor:
I share Michael Johns's frustration with the suburbanization of the city. It's interesting to note, however, that the new light fixtures in Hudson River Park are recent adaptations of the handsome Art Deco fixture originally used on the Triborough Bridge in the 1930's.
The fixtures depicted at Ninth Avenue and 35th Street are a type that was designed a decade ago by Ben Thompson &amp; Associates with Fisher Marantz under the auspices of the Grand Central Partnership to give a distinctive look to the business improvement district. They have proliferated over much of Midtown.
What is referred to as the bishop crook light fixture was installed on many New York streets around the turn of the 20th century. Its distinctive curved top gave rise to the nickname. This fixture has indeed been reinstalled in many historic districts, but is not suitable to most areas of modern New York.
