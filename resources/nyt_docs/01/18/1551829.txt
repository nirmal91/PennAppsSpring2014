''What Shakespeare is to Elizabethan theater, Dickens to the Victorian novel, and Picasso to modern art, Chaplin is to 20th-century cinema,'' Jeffrey Vance writes in CHAPLIN: Genius of the Cinema (Abrams, $50). Charles Chaplin (1889-1977) lived an extraordinarily rich and productive life, turbulent, full of romance (and romances), and this gorgeous, unwieldy slab of a book succeeds in being several books at once: filmography, biography, critical appraisal and family album. Its chief interest is its more than 500 photographs, many of them familiar images freshly reproduced from original Chaplin studio negatives. Many more are backstage shots: Chaplin with Einstein, Gandhi and George Bernard Shaw; Chaplin in an inexhaustible variety of costumes, poses, attitudes, situations; Chaplin in old age photographed by his fourth wife, Oona. The captions are troves of film arcana -- for instance, that Dean Riesner, 4 years old in 1923 when he played the bratty kid in a pageboy in ''The Pilgrim,'' later became a screenwriter for Clint Eastwood's ''Dirty Harry'' pictures. Vance, who has written books on Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, is generous in quoting the many fine writers who have interpreted Chaplin's art (chief among them Chaplin himself), but his judicious text is as fascinating as the photographs. ''The birth of modern comedy,'' he writes, ''occurred when Chaplin donned his derby hat, affixed his toothbrush mustache and stepped into his impossibly large shoes for the first time.''
