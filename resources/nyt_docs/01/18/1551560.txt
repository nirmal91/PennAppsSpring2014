The sweater is going on eBay.
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who recently donned an argyle sweater to help soften his stiff military image, and to stay warm in New Hampshire, announced on Friday night that he would put the sweater up for auction on the Internet, with the proceeds going to charity.
General Clark has been relentlessly teased about the sweater, which some fashion mavens declared as less than flattering and, well, nerdy. So when General Clark was asked about it on Friday during the taping of an appearance on HBO's ''Real Time With Bill Maher,'' he said he had decided to give it up for charity.
''That's certainly where it belongs,'' Mr. Maher responded.
Trouble is, the sweater does not really belong to General Clark. He borrowed it from his brother-in-law, Gene Caulfield, who travels with the general. Neither the general nor Mr. Caulfield is likely to catch a chill, however, even after giving up the argyle. Shortly after the eruption of sweatergate, as the press corps dubbed it, General Clark and Mr. Caulfield stopped at an L.L. Bean Factory Store to stock up on new sweaters. Nothing in argyle, however.
