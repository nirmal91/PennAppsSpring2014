''If there's one thing I've learned through all this, it's to keep all your paperwork,'' said Robert Cotten as he and his wife, Cynthia Brown, sipped coffee in a McDonald's in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
It might be a lesson learned too late. Mr. Cotten now has an inch-high manila folder holding neatly stacked paperwork accumulated over the past four years.
The couple have learned to keep something else: their sense of humor.
''There are some funny people in this world,'' Mr. Cotten said, rolling his eyes as if he had met them all.
There has not been much to laugh about since December 1996, when Ms. Brown said she and her children had to leave her Bronx apartment. She said her son was caught smoking marijuana outside the building, and the landlord asked the family to leave.
''I could understand it if he was selling drugs,'' Mr. Cotten said, looking at his hands. ''But he's a teenager. It was one joint.''
The family delayed the eviction until 1999 and then moved in with Ms. Brown's daughter, also named Cynthia, in Baychester, in the Bronx.
Mr. Cotten had a part-time maintenance job at a church and often slept there.
But the daughter's apartment was crowded, and two years later, the couple entered the city's family emergency assistance unit in the Bronx, which finds shelter for people.
Their plight was especially hard on Ms. Brown, who has often been hospitalized for heart problems and bronchial asthma. She has difficulty breathing and keeps an oxygen tank on hand.
Mr. Cotten said the New York City Housing Authority told him that the couple's application for permanent housing was delayed by $1,883.65 in rental arrears for another apartment in the Bronx that he had lived in earlier.
In February 2002, the Department of Homeless Services granted the couple temporary housing at the Webster Hotel in the Bronx. Their daughter, Margaret Cotten, and her son, Jaylen, 1 year old, live with them.
A caseworker gave Mr. Cotten a list of charities, which included the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven local beneficiaries of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In March, Kim Lerner, a caseworker at the federation, obtained $1,387 in Neediest Cases money to help Mr. Cotten pay off the debt on his old apartment. He paid the remaining $496 out of his own pocket. He thought their plight had ended.
But he was told their application for permanent housing had been delayed by a $4,389 debt Ms. Brown owed at the apartment she had been evicted from. Mr. Cotten said she thought the Department of Social Services had been paying the $153 rent. When he inquired, he said an office manager told him that the records had been archived.
''She said, 'They're in the basement,' '' Mr. Cotten said. '' 'We can't go down in the basement.' ''
''I went back,'' Mr. Cotten said. ''I said, 'Listen, can you please ask if there's any way to get in the basement? That lady will not go down in that basement. I'll go down in the basement. I'll hold your hand. You show me where the box is and I'll go do it myself. Just point.' ''
The couple laughed. Somehow, with all of their problems, they can still laugh.
''If you don't, you get angry and you start crying,'' Ms. Brown said.
Mr. Cotten has spoken to the social services department, and a Legal Aid lawyer is helping him.
Mr. Cotten said the Department of Homeless Services told him that if the couple's debt was under $5,000, they could pay it off a little at a time and their application for a new apartment would be reactivated.
The family, now living in St. John's Place Family Center, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is struggling to pay the debt, even though Mr. Cotten and Ms. Brown think the amount they are told they owe is a mistake.
''We just want to get out of this situation,'' Mr. Cotten said.
