To the Editor:
As a close personal friend of Shah Mohammed Rais, the subject of Asne Seierstad's controversial book, ''The Bookseller of Kabul,'' I wish to offer a perspective that is absent from Richard McGill Murphy's review (Dec. 21) and from the debate about the work in general.
Like other reviewers, Murphy addresses the issues of culture clash and betrayal of hospitality while apparently assuming that the facts narrated are entirely accurate, calling the book ''an effective portrait of one rather unhappy Afghan family.'' I beg to differ.
Having been a guest at Rais's home on numerous occasions over the last two years, I can testify that the atmosphere of oppression and sadness depicted simply does not exist. Though their formal education has indeed been disrupted by war and work, his multilingual sons are among the most culturally literate youngsters in Kabul; their general awareness of the world outside Afghanistan and penchant for joking are a constant uplift amid the grinding desolation of the capital.
Seierstad speaks neither Pashto nor Dari, the principal languages of the country, leaving the veracity of her long passages of dialogue open to question. I have found Rais's wives to be not only gracious and friendly but full participants in the warm family scenes that I was privileged to be a part of, and certainly neither ignorant nor deprived.
As for Rais himself, his preservation of his family and defense of his country's heritage while serving as a personable and generous sage to a generation of Western journalists in Kabul make him a symbol of the syncretic fusion of tradition and modernity that is Afghanistan's best hope. The cruel tyrant depicted in this book is not the man I know.
