Traub makes the stunning observation that ''Clinton, who inoculated the Democrats against attacks on so many domestic issues, never had the opportunity, or perhaps never saw the need, to do so in terms of national security.''
Really? During Clinton's tenure the World Trade Center was bombed, two embassies were blown up in Africa and the U.S.S. Cole was attacked in Yemen. The Clinton administration never publicly indicated that it understood that America was a target of terrorists, a stance that undoubtedly emboldened Al Qaeda and others to proceed with more attacks.
