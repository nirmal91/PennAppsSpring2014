Normally, stalkers are something that Madonna worries about, not Lou the barber. But state legislators say aggressive customers have become a problem for beauticians and hairstylists, so they have passed a law to prevent stalkers from learning their home addresses.
''The police chief in West Orange told me it happened to his stylist,'' said Assemblyman John F. McKeon, the Essex County Democrat who co-sponsored the measure. ''I asked around and overwhelmingly they said you can't imagine the weirdoes that bother you.''
State law requires barbers and stylists to display their licenses in shops, and their home addresses are usually plainly visible. But the new law would allow the hair cutters to obscure the part of the license that lists the address.
''Unfortunately, there are many people who may see a person's name and address on a license and use the information for some nefarious purpose,'' Mr. McKeon said.
State officials will still know the home address of the licensee, but sponsors said there is no reason for customers to have the information.
As Assemblyman Mims Hackett Jr., also an Essex County Democrat, put it, ''Knowing where a hairstylist lives is irrelevant as to whether he or she does a good job cutting hair.''
