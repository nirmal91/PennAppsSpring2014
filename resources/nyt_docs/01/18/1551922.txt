To the Editor:
So we are supposed to thank Good Charlotte for administering messages of hope to our forlorn and alienated youth [''Punk's Earnest New Mission'' by Michael Azerrad, Jan. 4]. Mr. Azerrad mentions ''Day That I Die,'' another song on Good Charlotte's latest album, but does not quote from the refrain: ''I swear the happiest day of my life is the day that I die.'' Schizophrenic, confused or just shrewdly playing both sides against the middle?
