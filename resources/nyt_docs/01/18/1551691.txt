You know the Miss America Pageant is in bad shape if one of its former leaders -- especially one who wasn't unceremoniously shown the door -- begins grumbling.
All it took was the appointment this month of Art McMaster -- the fifth chief executive of the sagging pageant in five years -- to prompt expressions of dismay from Leonard Horn, who was general counsel to the pageant from 1963 to 1987, when he came the chief executive.
''There is no question Miss America needed to change after I left,'' said Mr. Horn, who has lived in Tennessee since he left in 1999. ''But there are old programs of every sort that have managed to change and update. The Miss America program should have been able to do that. What it has lacked is leadership.''
He said that when he left he recommended to the board that it conduct a national search for someone who knew how to get money from corporations, arrange sponsorships and bring the program into a more national focus.
''I don't think the board really understands,'' he said. ''They go back more than 30 years, when this was a mom-and-pop operation that could be run by a local person. I took it as far as I could, but it still had major challenges and they should have understood that this is a national institution that needed national talent.''
That said, Mr. Horn said he did not want to put down Mr. McMaster, who was named interim chief executive after holding several jobs with the organization. He replaced George Bauer, who was dumped after only 14 months at the helm.
The unseemly spectacle led Mr. Horn to lament: ''The concept of the beauty pageant in some form is ingrained in the American psyche. The one that started it all, Miss America, should have been able to capitalize on that. The board of directors bears responsibility for that failure.''
