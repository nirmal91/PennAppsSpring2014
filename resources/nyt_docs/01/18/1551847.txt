Irritated word watchers from across the country submitted a record 5,000 nominations for this year's List of Words Banished From the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness, selected each January since 1976 by the Word Banishment Committee at Lake Superior State University in Sault St. Marie, Mich. Topping the list of 2004 winners (or losers) is ''metrosexual.'' After all, Carly Simon got there first; as one man from Massachusetts asked: ''Aren't there enough words to describe men who spend too much time in front of the mirror?''
Others on the list of 17 words and phrases include ''punked,'' ''bling-bling,'' ''LOL'' and creeping e-mailspeak, like ''@'' in advertisements.
Mostly, however, the list reflects the year at war. ''Embedded journalist,'' ''shock and awe,'' ''smoking gun,'' ''captured alive,'' ''in harm's way'' and ''shots rang out'' are all banished. One nominator fretted that it would be one short step to ''Shock and Awe Pool Cleaner''; another argued that ''shots don't 'ring' unless you are standing too close to the muzzle, and in that case you don't need the reporter telling you about it.''
One phrase banished last year was reinstated. Green Bay Packer fans had protested that ''frozen tundra'' is not redundant, as tundra (like Wisconsin) can also be flooded, dusty or muddy. See the complete list and make nominations for next year at lssu.edu/banished.
