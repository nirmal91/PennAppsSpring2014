To the Editor:
The article noted how many industrial jobs were being exported to China and how many service jobs were going to India.
A corporate tax rebate for companies, based on some amount of personal income tax they withhold on their workers employed in the United States, would go a long way toward addressing the issue in a sensible and effective way.
Right now, when jobs leave the United States, the Internal Revenue Service loses the personal income tax on them. But if jobs stayed here, the I.R.S. could keep collecting that tax, helping it offset a loss of corporate tax from lower company profits. And if more Americans were working, the I.R.S. and companies alike would benefit from a stronger economy.
In short, such a rebate should make companies think twice before outsourcing jobs overseas.
