The New York State Thruway Authority reinstated thousands of E-ZPass privileges this week after mistakenly suspending or revoking the passes of motorists who violated the 20 miles per hour speed limit at two higher speed lanes at the Tappan Zee Bridge toll booths. The mix-up resulted in long lines and delays at the span as commuters were forced to use cash lanes.
Daniel J. Gilbert, a spokesman for the Thruway Authority, said some 11,000 suspensions and 1,700 revocations were issued before drivers who had received one warning got a chance to appeal. Drivers who violate the speed limit in the E-ZPass lanes are given two weeks to appeal their first violation, but because of some technical malfunctions at newly installed lanes between Dec. 13 and 27 privileges were lifted before there was an opportunity for appeal.
The authority is essentially rolling back the clock to Dec. 12. If on Dec. 12 a driver had one warning, Mr. Gilbert said, that driver would go back to one warning. ''We've taken the appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again,'' he said.
