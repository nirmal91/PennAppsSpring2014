I was strictly a chicken-sandwich-on-whole-wheat and hot-fudge-sundae type (Food: Jonathan Reynolds, Jan. 4). Why, oh why, did you leave out the best of all recipes: the hot fudge? So thick, so gloriously oozy, it turned to solid candy as the ice cream puddled around it. It was a real challenge to finish the two together. But then, the metal sundae dishes had corners you could scrape for the last speck of fudge.
Now that was Schrafft's!
