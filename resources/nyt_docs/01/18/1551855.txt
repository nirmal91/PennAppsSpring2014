Like Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution, James Traub seems haunted by the prospect of George W. Bush confronting Howard Dean in a debate about the mass graves in Iraq (Jan. 4). But why? I imagine that Dean (or Wesley Clark, for that matter) would simply say something like this: ''I've spoken to many Americans during this campaign, and I don't think I've met one who was unhappy that Saddam Hussein is out of power. But I've met thousands who are unhappy with the way you put him out. You alienated our allies, you violated international law and you brought about the deaths of thousands more Iraqis and hundreds of Americans. The end does not justify the means. Dozens of countries and millions of citizens pleaded with you to take a path other than unilateral intervention, and you ignored them.''
