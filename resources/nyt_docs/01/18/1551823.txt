A rhinoceros, a cabby by trade, walks into a diner and asks for two eggs, sunny side up. A mouse follows him in, lugging a cello. He wants two eggs over easy.
This is not the setup for a joke. It's the beginning of TWO EGGS, PLEASE (Atheneum, $18; ages 3 to 5), written by Sarah Weeks and illustrated by Betsy Lewin.
As Weeks's story progresses, a hungry menagerie of creatures from all walks of life wanders into the diner, each with an egg preference. Each order is followed by a pregnant pause as every animal reflects that the newcomer is very different from himself in both species and chosen breakfast. But in the hands of the ursine short-order cook, each order starts out simply: as two eggs. The same.
The book makes a simple point: we're all different, but in many respects we are the same. Like eggs. Sort of. To some adults, it might seem sappy. But in times like these, it's good to be able to give children a message of tolerance.
Betsy Lewin's illustrations have the exuberant, colorful jiggliness of her previous work, including ''Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type,'' about farm animals that unionize. (No, really. It's great.)
While reading ''Two Eggs,'' a child of an analytical bent might want to know why a bird, say a stork, is ordering a plate of, um, eggs. This could lead to a discussion of cannibalism, or at least of artistic license, or anthropomorphism. You never know where a book, or a small child, will lead you. But if you end up talking about the intended theme -- tolerance, remember? -- well, so much the better.
