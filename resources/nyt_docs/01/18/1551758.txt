To the Editor:
Re ''The Vital Republican Center,'' by Christie Whitman (Op-Ed, Jan. 12):
I think of myself as a moderate Republican, but I'm puzzled as to which ''stance'' of President Bush on ''education, health care and the environment'' is supposed to ''resonate'' with me.
The overpromising and underfinanced No Child Left Behind initiative? The prescription-drug benefit, which cuts off the availability of cheaper drugs from Canada and forbids Medicare from negotiating prices?
The Clear Skies program, which allows coal-burning plants to renovate without installing antipollution equipment? Or perhaps the ongoing fight to drill for the small supply of oil in the Alaskan wilderness?
Have I been left so far behind by moderate Republicans moving to the right that I'm in danger of being overtaken by the Democrats?
