To the Editor:
Since the mapping of the human genome in 2000, a growing body of scientific evidence from many sources, especially cutting-edge research techniques like genomics and proteomics, is providing new clues to the underlying causes of cancer and supports the importance of diet and nutrition in preventing certain types of cancer (front page, Jan. 11).
For example, it is a fact that obesity is clearly a risk factor for many kinds of cancer. It has also been proved that weight gain after diagnosis of breast cancer confers an adverse prognosis.
By joining forces to conduct further research, especially on translating basic research findings into patient interventions, we can create new opportunities to empower the public with education and information for more effective cancer prevention and control.
