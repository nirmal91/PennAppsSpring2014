An article yesterday about the plans of a top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee to call on President Bush to explain problems in the prewar intelligence on Iraq misstated the issue date of a National Intelligence Estimate that said that country possessed chemical and biological weapons and an active nuclear weapons program. It was October 2002, not 2003. The article also misidentified the radio network that interviewed Secretary of State Colin H. Powell this week about the intelligence on Iraq. It was Public Radio International, not National Public Radio.
