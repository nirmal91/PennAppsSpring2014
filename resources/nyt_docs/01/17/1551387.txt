Devils defenseman Scott Stevens will participate in a ceremony in his honor this afternoon at Continental Arena, but he will not be in uniform. Nor will he play against the Washington Capitals because of what the Devils say may be a concussion.
Stevens, the Devils' captain, is being saluted by the team for playing in 1,635 games, more than any other defenseman in N.H.L. history. This game will be the fifth he has missed.
Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello said Thursday that the 39-year-old Stevens was expected to miss at least another week to 10 days.
