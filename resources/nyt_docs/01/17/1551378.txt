An article on Wednesday about David Gewirtzman, a Holocaust survivor who gives talks in the New York City schools, referred incorrectly to his children. They are a son and a daughter, not two sons. The article also misstated the amount of time his wife, Lillian, and her family spent in a Siberian labor camp during the Russian occupation of Poland. It was 14 months, not six years.
