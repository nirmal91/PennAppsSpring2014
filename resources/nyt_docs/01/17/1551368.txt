A judge has ruled against family members of a murder victim who sued the East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office for removing the victim's head before releasing his cremated remains. The judge, R. Michael Caldwell of State District Court, said state law let coroners keep parts of remains as possible evidence in crimes. The body of the victim, Edwin Robillard, was found, with an unusual head wound, atop a school, said a spokesman for the coroner.
