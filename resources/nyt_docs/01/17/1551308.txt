Re ''Fantasy and Reality in Iowa: Quick! Which Is the Candidate and Which Is the Actor?,'' by Francis X. Clines (Editorial Notebook, Jan. 16):
Here in Iowa, we have already experienced the reality of a Bush administration that encourages corporate farming, leaves rural communities reeling from the ripple effect of state budgets in meltdown, sends our boys and girls to die in Iraq while using the survivors as public relations props, and that treats the environment like a trading commodity.
On Monday night, some of us will meet in a small building in the hamlet of Walnut. The hard-working people who will caucus here will reach out for the promise of a return to sanity in America. One hopes that is not a fantasy.
