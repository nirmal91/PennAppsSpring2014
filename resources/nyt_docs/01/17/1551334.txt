A meeting in Brussels of high-level American and European civil aviation officials broke up without an agreement on putting armed guards on international flights bound for the United States. European representatives complained to Asa Hutchinson, under secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, of American unilateralism, telling him it was ''creating considerable uproar.'' Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Portugal are firmly against the use of armed marshals, a European Union official present at the meeting said, while Spain, the Netherlands, Hungary and Italy are opposed in principle. France and Britain are reportedly allowing sky marshals on flights.
