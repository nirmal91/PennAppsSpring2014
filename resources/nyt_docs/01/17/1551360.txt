Facing growing financial pressures and increased fees from the state, the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation announced yesterday that it would dismiss almost 17 percent of its managerial staff.
In all, about 25 people will lose their jobs as a result of the cost-cutting measure, according to Raymond V. Casey, the president of the corporation.
The move comes as the racing industry as a whole has come under increased scrutiny because of the scandals surrounding the New York Racing Association, which operates the state's three premiere thoroughbred tracks under a state franchise. Federal prosecutors have alleged that top officials at the racing association engaged in conspiracy, tax evasion and fraud.
Yet Mr. Casey said the layoffs were not related to the OTB's association with the N.Y.R.A. Instead, he said they were the result of his organization's attempt to both become more efficient and to deal with a law passed last year in Albany that increased the fees levied by the state.
While Mr. Casey said that the new law had also created possible new revenue sources for off-track betting, like allowing more thoroughbred races from out of state to be telecast, he added that it would take time for those new options to generate money.
Mr. Casey said the layoffs were part of a larger streamlining of the operation, which employees 1,900 people, roughly 125 at the managerial level. "The layoff is the thing that has the most impact on individuals," Mr. Casey said. "But it is being done with a lot of other measures to save money."
The corporation was created in 1970 and functions as a quasi-public entity. The goal was to try to wrest some control over the gambling industry away from the mafia, while generating revenue for the city and state.
Last year, the corporation took in roughly $1 billion in bets and had revenue of about $200 million. Of that, $25 million was given to the city, $12 million was given to the state, and $89 million was given to the racing industry.
