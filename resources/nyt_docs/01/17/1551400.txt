To the Editor:
Re ''Hurray! A Constitution! (Tell It to the Warlords)'' (Letter From Asia, news article, Jan. 14):
Regarding Afghanistan's warlords, you write that reportedly when Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and Burhanuddin Rabbani (who is my father and the former Afghan president) ''pushed too hard for their desires in the Constitution,'' they were reminded by the United States ambassador and the United Nations special envoy ''that they could face trial for war crimes.''
In fact, the broad participation of delegates and their desire to reach a consensus resulted in the successful ratification of the Constitution.
To suggest that the grand council was successful as a result of outside interference negates the impartiality of the United Nations and the United States, the country that epitomizes the essence of democracy.
What we Afghans need at this time is the support of our international friends to bring us close to each other. Declaring one section of the Afghan people as warlords and the other as democrats or liberals doesn't help Afghanistan. Afghans need reconciliation, coexistence and pluralism more than anything else at this critical juncture.
