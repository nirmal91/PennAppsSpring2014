In a potential blow to the Interpublic Group of Companies, Verizon Wireless, one of Interpublic's largest clients, said yesterday that it would expand a search for creative ideas beyond two Interpublic agencies that have been reviewed since October: Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide, the incumbent, and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone that spends more than $700 million a year on marketing, is seeking new ways to present in its ads the character who asks ''Can you hear me now?'' Because ''we're not completely satisfied with what we saw, we're going to open it up to other agencies,'' said Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman at Verizon Wireless in Bedminster, N.J.. A spokesman at Interpublic in New York, Philippe Krakowsky, said, ''Our work has helped build one of America's most powerful brands, and we look forward to defending the business.''
