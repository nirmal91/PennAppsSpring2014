Nuclear experts said Friday that preliminary tests on a small amount of low-level radioactive material discovered in a Rotterdam shipping container from the Middle East indicated it was natural uranium in the very early stages of refinement. They said the material could have come from Iraq.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was in the process of comparing the material to laboratory samples taken from a former Iraqi uranium processing plant that was dismantled in the 1990's.
Investigators suspect that the Rotterdam material -- too little and too unrefined for use in a nuclear weapon -- was overlooked in the cleanup of the Iraqi plant.
The uranium was discovered inside a shipment of scrap metal. Dutch officials said this week that the material was uranium oxide, or yellowcake. But the agency said initial tests indicated that it was in a ''pre-yellowcake'' stage.
