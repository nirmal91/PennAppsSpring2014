To the Editor:
Thanks to Francis X. Clines for sharing a poetic bike ride around Manhattan (''Rounding the Island, on Wheels,'' The City Life, Jan. 12).
Those who ride the Hudson River path every day, as I do, surely appreciated the homage to ''the buckled and rusted skeletons of old terminals leaning wanly toward the river.''
Unfortunately, those strange, twisted structures don't ''dodge extinction''; some are being dismantled.
In a city where utility is so highly prized, they were beautiful for their crumbling uselessness, their stark contrast to the shining new complex rising nearby, and the fact that they had managed to survive demolition in this constantly self-regenerating metropolis.
But whoever decides these things has decided that their time has come. They will be missed, especially by the bikers who ply the Hudson shoreline.
