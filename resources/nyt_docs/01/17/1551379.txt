Because of an editing error, an obituary on Tuesday about Perry B. Duryea, a former speaker of the New York State Legislature, misstated the sequence of events in Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's accession to the vice presidency. Rockefeller, whom Mr. Duryea had hoped to succeed, resigned the governorship in December 1973. He was nominated for the vice presidency by President Gerald R. Ford in August 1974 and confirmed in December. He did not leave Albany directly for Washington.
