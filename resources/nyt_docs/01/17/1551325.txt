To the Editor:
Re ''School Reform Left Behind'' (editorial, Jan. 10):
You correctly say ''education reform will go nowhere unless students are taught by strong, qualified teachers.''
The way to keep good teachers is to give them better conditions -- respect as professionals, time to plan, freedom to teach, smaller classes, adequate resources and fewer high-stakes tests.
The No Child Left Behind law is the solution that H. L. Mencken called ''neat, plausible and wrong.''
