To the Editor:
Re ''Ethnic Friction Over Signs That Lack Translations'' (news article, Jan. 10):
If stores in ethnic neighborhoods really could benefit financially from bilingual signs, then there is economic advantage and they will prosper or perish accordingly.
But let's not fool ourselves. Some specialty businesses attract customers only from a very specific national background. No amount of English would change that.
Some say they can no longer determine what a business is selling. Ridiculous! Go inside. Look around.
Do we want a government-backed language police? There are signs on subway trains written entirely in Spanish. Where is the outrage? Many bodegas sell food with labels only in Spanish. Oh, my!
I suggest that we do not want more laws about awnings. We want businesses in New York to prosper. No one can seriously claim that he feels left out because of single-language signs. Can one's self-esteem be so brittle?
