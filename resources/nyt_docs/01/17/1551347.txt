Gen. Wesley K. Clark said that he believed the Confederate battle flag should be removed from the grounds of the Capitol in Columbia, S.C., adding that he would carry that message to South Carolina when he campaigned there on Monday, which is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In a conference call with reporters, General Clark said the flag was a symbol of a divisive past. ''I don't believe we ought to be honoring flags that divide us,'' he said.
