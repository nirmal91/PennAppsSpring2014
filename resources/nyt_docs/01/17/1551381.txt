Because of a production error, a picture on Thursday showing the Callichoron well in Greece (a site of ancient mourning rituals), with an appraisal of the plan for the ground zero memorial known as Reflecting Absence, was reproduced in mirror image. The wall in the background should have appeared at the left of the well, not the right.
