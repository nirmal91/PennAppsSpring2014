The family of a New Jersey cheerleader who fell to her death at a hotel in Hawaii before she was to perform at the Hula Bowl has hired a lawyer and a private investigator to look into the circumstances of her death, the lawyer said yesterday.
James Krueger, a lawyer in Maui, said the family of Lauren Crossan, 18, the cheerleader from Randolph, N.J., who died early Monday, wanted to know more about what led to her fall from a hotel room hours after she arrived in Hawaii. They also want further drug tests, he said.
After a preliminary autopsy, the police in Maui said that the death was accidental and that alcohol might have been involved.
Mr. Krueger said Ms. Crossan's parents wanted to know how their daughter's death occurred so soon after she arrived at the hotel, the Hyatt Regency Resort and Spa.
''There are issues pertaining to supervision,'' he said in a telephone interview from California, where he was traveling on other business. ''There are issues pertaining to where the liquor came from.''
The police said Ms. Crossan apparently fell from a room occupied by two men, 19 and 20 years old, from Folsom, Calif., at least one of whom she had met after she arrived.
Ms. Crossan and two other Randolph High School cheerleaders, Michelle D'Aconti and Mandy Mason, won national competitions last June to perform at halftime of the Hula Bowl football game today.
But within hours of their arrival, Ms. Crossan's naked body was found in shrubbery at the base of one of the hotel's three residential towers.
Lt. Tivoli Faaumu of the Maui police said yesterday that toxicology reports on a blood sample from Ms. Crossan were not expected back for several more days. But he said on Thursday that investigators did not believe drugs were involved.
The two men, he said, had been questioned and released.
Ms. Crossan and the two other cheerleaders were chosen by the National Cheerleaders Association, a division of the National Spirit Group, based in Dallas.
