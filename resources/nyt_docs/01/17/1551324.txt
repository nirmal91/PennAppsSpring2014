To the Editor:
The Bush administration has failed to finance school reform adequately (''School Reform Left Behind,'' editorial, Jan. 10). But even with an extra infusion of federal money, the No Child Left Behind law will still be fundamentally flawed.
A plan that will ultimately identify nearly every district in the country as ''in need of improvement'' -- a near certain result of the law, according to independent researchers -- is clearly out of touch with reality.
Nor does it make sense to divert money from underfinanced schools to for-profit test coaching companies, as the law encourages. No wonder that there is a growing, bipartisan resistance to compliance with the law in communities around the country.
To improve education for all our children, the entire law, not just its financing, must be overhauled.
