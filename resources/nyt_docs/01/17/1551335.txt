A popular talk show host quit his job after 17 years with the BBC in a dispute over anti-Arab comments he made in a newspaper column. The host, Robert Kilroy-Silk, said in a statement that he recognized ''the difficulties this has caused the BBC,'' even as he insisted that he was entitled to express his views and that many viewers supported him. Still, he said, protests lodged by the Muslim Council of Britain and other groups were best addressed by his resignation. The offending column first appeared last spring in The Sunday Express, which reprinted it this month. In it Mr. Kilroy-Silk asked, what do Arabs ''think we feel about them?'' adding, ''that we admire them for being suicide bombers, limb amputators, women repressors?''
