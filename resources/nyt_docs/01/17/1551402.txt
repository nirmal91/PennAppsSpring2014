George Balanchine liked the idea of pairing a short Oberon with a tall Titania in his ''Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Maria Kowroski's Titania certainly towered over Joaquin De Luz, who danced Oberon for the first time in a performance by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater. But Mr. De Luz was less an Oberon than a Puck.
Oberon is a king, but Mr. De Luz never allowed the character to be regal, emphasizing instead the role's gleeful pyrotechnics. It is understandable, given Mr. De Luz's prodigious technique and exuberant stage presence. But he has also proved himself as an actor, so the much-needed shading may come.
Ms. Kowroski was a sweetly girlish, expansive Titania. Her duet with the donkey, Bottom, danced by Seth Orza with all the right tender and comic accents, was a highlight. Daniel Ulbricht brought the larger-than-life style and gutsiness of a Soviet character dancer to the role of Puck.
Sébastien Marcovici provided the right velvety solemnity and decent partnering in his performance of the ballet's divertissement pas de deux. Miranda Weese added the magic, with dancing that looked both carefully thought out and instinctual, in a haunting evocation of romantic love that is one of Balanchine's most beautiful dances.
The lovers, danced by Carla Körbes, Jennifer Tinsley, Jonathan Stafford and Jason Fowler brought freshly dramatic and comic life to the midsummer maelstrom. And Teresa Reichlin was a bold, clear Hippolyta, her turns as fast and true as an arrow's path, in a lead cast completed by Megan Fairchild, Charles Askegard and Ask la Cour. The lead singers were Courtenay Budd and Rosalie Sullivan. Paul Mann conducted the Mendelssohn score.
