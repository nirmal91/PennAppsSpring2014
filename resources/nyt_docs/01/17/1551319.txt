To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof's emotional appeal for free trade is an understandable response to the stench of a Cambodian garbage dump, where he visits ''scavengers like Nhep Chanda, who spends her days rooting through filth'' (''Calling All Democrats,'' column, Jan. 14).
Experience shows that free trade rewards abusive labor practices, child exploitation, even slavery, while penalizing fair wages, health plans and unions. It cannot raise the standard of living in the third world, because as soon as significant capital goes to labor, the jobs are moved. The only winners are the multinationals making productivity gains on the backs of the desperate.
Attaching labor and environmental standards to trade agreements is not anti-trade; it is pro-human.
