To the Editor:
Re ''Calling All Democrats,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 14):
The key for equitable development is increasing labor productivity -- not just for a few lucky workers in a couple of enterprises, but for the economy as a whole. And in a country like Cambodia, with a huge rural labor force, that cannot happen without increasing labor productivity in the agricultural sector. No standards for factories imposed from the outside can achieve that.
