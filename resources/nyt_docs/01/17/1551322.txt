To the Editor:
In his Jan. 14 column, ''Calling All Democrats,'' Nicholas D. Kristof argues that ''the fundamental problem in the poor countries . . . is not that sweatshops exploit too many workers; it's that they don't exploit enough.''
The fundamental problem is that for pennies' worth of labor, we are sold shoes that cost well over $100.
You don't have to be an economist to know that something is seriously wrong with the system. You merely need to be human to know that desperate workers here and abroad are being exploited to the benefit of a few. Such a system hardly deserves our praise, or even our acquiescence.
