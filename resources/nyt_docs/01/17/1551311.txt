To the Editor:
David Brooks gloats that Republicans are near-unanimous on major issues of the day, while Democrats appear divided (''The Bush Democrats,'' column, Jan. 13).
This is not a reason for gloating, but for concern.
Lively debate is the hallmark of a healthy democracy. Lockstep thinking, on the other hand, and its by-product, intolerance, are what we associate with totalitarian movements.
