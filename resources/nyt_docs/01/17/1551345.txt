''Persians''  Pearl Theater Company  80 St. Marks Place, East Village
Don't be too hard on Aeschylus if his 2,475-year-old play blunders by hitting its dramatic peak when it's only half over. Western playwriting was still being invented when he wrote it; he probably didn't know any better. And besides, Scott Whitehurst hadn't been born yet.
In this lean rendition of ''Persians,'' running through Feb. 8, Mr. Whitehurst is so commanding as the Messenger that everything afterward seems anticlimactic. But this is still an illuminating production.
The play tells of the battle of Salamis in 480 B.C., in which a superior Persian force was defeated by the Greeks. Pearl, true to its mission of presenting classics without much embellishment, keeps this work as spare as can be. The four actors who make up the chorus double as the play's four named characters, each stepping out of the chorus in turn.
Joanne Camp as Queen Atossa is the weakest. She seems barely bothered by her premonition that things are not going to go well at Salamis. Then Mr. Whitehurst arrives, bearing news from the battlefront, which he delivers in a riveting wail that would rightly have set the whole Persian Empire to fearing for its future.
Robert Hock is suitably crestfallen as the ghost of Darius, the former king, dismayed by the course that his son, Xerxes, has chosen. And Sean McNall's scrawniness works nicely in his favor when he turns up, shirtless, as Xerxes.
