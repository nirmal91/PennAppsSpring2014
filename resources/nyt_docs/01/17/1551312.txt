To the Editor:
David Brooks asserts that Republicans are united and Democrats divided (''The Bush Democrats,'' column, Jan. 13) by choosing the questions from a Pew Center study that divide Democrats.
If the questions were ''Should environmental protections be strengthened?,'' ''Should we attack Iraq's neighbors if they don't respect United States authority in the region?'' or ''Should we improve government support for rising health care costs?,'' it would be the Republicans who appeared divided.
The reality is that some questions divide one party and other questions the other. In the Democratic primary season, it is no surprise that we are hearing the questions that divide Democrats.
