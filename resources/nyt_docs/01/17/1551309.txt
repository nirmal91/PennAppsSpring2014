To the Editor:
This country faces many complex issues for which it desperately needs solutions.
Vigorous debate aids the electorate in making decisions about policies to solve those issues and in finding leaders who will support those policies.
Attacks on the patriotism and motivations of candidates needlessly distract from that debate and hinder legitimate attempts to find solutions.
Paul Krugman's Jan. 16 column, ''Who Gets It?,'' praises the very conduct that damages political discourse in this country rather than advances it.
He commends ''those who are willing to question not just the policies but also the honesty and the motives of the people running our country,'' specifically praising Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who said: ''I think we're dealing with the most closed, imperialistic, nastiest administration in living memory. They even put Richard Nixon to shame.''
This approach produces titillating sound bites but no solutions to our country's problems.
