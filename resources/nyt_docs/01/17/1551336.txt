The World Health Organization said a 5-year-old boy in Nam Dinh Province died this month of avian influenza, bringing the country's total of confirmed deaths from bird flu in recent weeks to four. The agency revised its earlier count, which it had put at 10 deaths, but said they were still under investigation. No human-to-human transmission of the avian strain, A(H5N1), has been identified, the W.H.O. said, and the infection so far is believed to have been transmitted from physical contact with poultry, not from eating it.
