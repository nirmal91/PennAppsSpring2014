The Nassau County police are investigating what role the extreme cold played in the death of a Long Island woman whose body was found near her house Thursday afternoon after her car veered onto a neighbor's lawn.
Detectives said the woman, Philomena Fitzsimons, 54, of Bayville, N.Y., lay outside for at least six hours and possibly for more than 12.
Detective Sgt. Steven Pastor of the Nassau police said that the woman was wearing a light coat but was otherwise unequipped for the weather. ''Given the amount of time she was out there, no amount of clothing is going to help you for this type of weather,'' he said.
The temperature at the Islip recording station on Long Island was 8 degrees on Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.
On Wednesday night, when Mrs. Fitzsimons, a registered nurse who worked in people's homes, did not return from taking care of a neighbor's ailing mother, her husband began calling the police and local hospitals.
A neighbor, Steve Megaloudis, noticed Mrs. Fitzsimons's car, a silver Ford Focus, about 8 a.m. Thursday. He said the car had been driven between a tree and a parked car up onto his lawn and had run into some hedges.
Around 1 p.m., Mr. Megaloudis, unaware that it was Mrs. Fitzsimons's car, called the police to have it towed. No one spotted the woman's body until Mr. Fitzsimons, who had canvassed the neighborhood previously, found her at 2:30 p.m. partly hidden by a Jet Ski in another yard.
Mr. Megaloudis said the car's driver-side door was open and the keys were still in the ignition.
