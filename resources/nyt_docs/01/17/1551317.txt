Citing problems from a Brazilian operation, the Molson beer group of Canada said that it expected that earnings before tax and interest would increase by no more than 2 percent in the fiscal year that will end March 31. The company, based in Montreal, had previously set a growth target of 14.5 percent. Two years ago, Molson bought an 80 percent stake in the Kaiser group, Brazil's second-biggest brewer, behind AmBev.
