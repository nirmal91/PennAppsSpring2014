To the Editor:
David Brooks's point that 57 percent of Americans favor a candidate who sees the Iraq war as necessary (''The Bush Democrats,'' column, Jan. 13) is perhaps the most essential fact of the entire 2004 election.
If the Democratic Party is to avoid committing electoral suicide in November, it needs to nominate a presidential candidate who combines socially progressive domestic programs with a sharp-edged understanding of the legitimate role of military force in an increasingly unstable yet ''globalized'' world.
Democratic caucus and primary voters would be wise to weigh this basic reality very carefully as they head to the polls.
