The Justice Department said it would not appeal a judge's decision to allow John W. Hinckley Jr. unsupervised visits with his parents outside a psychiatric hospital. Mr. Hinckley has lived in the hospital since he was acquitted, by reason of insanity, for shooting President Ronald Reagan and three other people outside a Washington hotel in 1981. In his ruling last month, the judge, Paul L. Friedman of United States District Court for the District of Columbia, limited Mr. Hinckley's movements and called on his parents to supervise him on trips.
