To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 14) argues that proponents of international labor rights are na√Øve, because poor people in Cambodia and other developing countries prefer factory jobs to alternative work that is even more exploitative.
Mr. Kristof does not say that Cambodia is host to the most successful experiment in linking labor rights to trade agreements.
Under a trade agreement between Cambodia and the United States, the International Labor Organization monitors Cambodian factories. In return for compliance on labor rights, the United States grants additional trade benefits. The program, which I helped design, is one reason that factory jobs are growing in Cambodia. There is no contradiction between supporting job creation and supporting practical programs to make those jobs less exploitative.
