Responding to a higher-than-expected rate of retirement in recent months, the City Department of Correction said yesterday that it would hire 400 officers to patrol its jails. The new officers, after graduating from the Correction Academy, will be ready for assignment in June, a spokesman said.
The addition to the 9,429 sworn staff members in the department will be its second large increase in three months. The staff loses an average of 65 or so officers a month to retirement, resignations and other factors.
The new officers will be selected from lists of people who have already passed the city's civil service exam, said Thomas Antenen, the Correction Department spokesman. They will begin their academy training in mid-February, he said.
In May, the Correction Department laid off 315 officers as part of the Bloomberg administration's cost-cutting measures. But in November, Commissioner Martin F. Horn announced a plan to rehire those officers, partly because attrition had depleted the force faster than expected, partly because his new policy to guard against inmate suicides required more officers on duty. Eventually, 286 of the 315 officers took their jobs back, Mr. Antenen said.
Union officials welcomed the announcement. ''We're always understaffed, on a daily basis,'' said Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association.
