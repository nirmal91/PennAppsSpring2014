In the exuberance of the Colts' victory over the Chiefs last week, Indianapolis tight end Marcus Pollard made a comment that has reached the Patriots' ears.
Pollard said that if the Colts kept playing as well as they had in their first two playoff games -- they haven't had to punt in either of them -- then ''they might as well just hand us the rings.''
Patriots safety Rodney Harrison was irked by the remark this week, and during a news conference yesterday, quarterback Tom Brady fired back.
''If that happens to be his mind-set, you have 53 guys who will do everything possible to change it,'' Brady said.
Brady said he did not think anyone in the Patriots' locker room would say such a thing. ''Not only do we not say anything stupid, we don't think anything stupid,'' he said.
