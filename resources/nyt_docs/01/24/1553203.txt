Re ''Make That Steak a Bit Smaller, Atkins Advises Today's Dieters'' (front page, Jan. 18):
I'm glad to read that the Atkins acolytes are now recommending a reduction in saturated fat, but I'm disappointed that they are trying to make it appear as if this has been their recommendation all along.
As someone who debated Dr. Robert C. Atkins on numerous occasions before he died, I never heard him say anything about limiting fat intake.
I'm glad that Atkins Nutritionals now acknowledges the importance of limiting the intake of fat as well as simple carbohydrates.
