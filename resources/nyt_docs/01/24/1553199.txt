Re ''Make That Steak a Bit Smaller, Atkins Advises Today's Dieters'' (front page, Jan. 18):
If Atkins Nutritionals now acknowledges that saturated fat should be constrained, on what basis does it contrive a threshold for it of 20 percent of calories? The evidence supports an intake of saturated fat maximally half that level.
The rapid Atkins diet weight loss of which the public is enamored is the product of the induction phase, in which saturated fat intake is unrestricted, and essentially all carbohydrate, even from the most healthful foods, is taboo.
Restricting carbohydrate and ignoring the overall nutritional quality of foods consumed is every bit as misguided as basing a low-fat diet principally on Snackwell cookies.
