To the Editor:
The front-page picture of Santiago Calatrava's railway terminal design (''A Winged Railway Station for Lower Manhattan,'' Jan. 23) brought tears to my eyes. It is stunningly beautiful. It integrates the cathedral-like latticework left standing by that dark pit. At once, it is bent, it enfolds and it soars like a bird in the sky.
