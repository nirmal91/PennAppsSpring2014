A picture caption on Thursday with an article about the planned exhumation of the body of Helen C. Dean gave an incorrect attribution in some copies for the accusation that she was a victim of a nurse who has confessed to killing dozens of his patients. The accusation was made by her son, Larry A. Dean, not by her husband, who was pictured. The caption also misstated her husband's given name in some copies. He was Mark Dean, not Larry.
