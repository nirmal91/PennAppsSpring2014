To the Editor:
Re ''Blacks and Latinos Try to Find Balance in Touchy New Math'' (front page, Jan. 17):
The numbers don't permit an exact comparison, but the political relationships of blacks to Latinos and blacks to women is somewhat analogous. The groups are not mutually exclusive, and the millions of black women members have dual identifications imposed on them.
The common experience of widespread discrimination, however, doesn't guarantee a seamless coalition between either of these overlapping demographic couples. Their histories are different and their political issues are not always the same. Occasional conflict is inevitable.
As an African-American, I suggest that liberal blacks and Latinos do what conservative women and Hispanics have done: recognize that mutual political interests sometimes require selective interaction inside and outside their political groups.
