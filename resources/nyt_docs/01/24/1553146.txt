To the Editor:
In ''Heartless Marriage Plans'' (editorial, Jan. 17), you call President Bush's marriage plan ''one of those rather expensive but basically symbolic gestures.'' Not true.
Under the plan, up to $300 million a year would be dedicated to marriage education services to help couples who have chosen marriage for themselves form and sustain a healthy marriage. For low-income couples, this would undeniably improve the lives of children.
Moreover, you claim that low-income communities have been stripped of '' 'marriageable' men.'' To the contrary, research by the Heritage Foundation examining a sample of mostly unwed parents at the time a child is born found that two-thirds of the non-married fathers studied had at least a high-school degree, 97 percent were employed during the past year and they had earnings sufficient to bring a family of three out of poverty.
President Bush's plan is a forward-looking, common-sense initiative to encourage healthy marriages.
