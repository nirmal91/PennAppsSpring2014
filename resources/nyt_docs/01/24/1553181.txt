The New Hampshire presidential primary's long history as the first in the nation, and its tradition of town meetings and candidate house parties, has always made it a sort of sentimental favorite. But alas, its time has passed.
The idea of New Hampshire was retail politics. Dark horse candidates with little money could make an impact through one town hall meeting after another. That was how John McCain beat George Bush, and Paul Tsongas toppled Bill Clinton. Those candidacies withered once they headed south for the multiple primaries in larger states. But in a nation that had lost faith in political Cinderella stories, the myth endured: an underfinanced but idealistic maverick might not grow up to be president, but he could still become the winner of the New Hampshire primary.
But this year, New Hampshire is not a respite from high-pressure national politics. It's an entire national election crammed into one small, cold state. The town hall meetings stopped being retail politics when the sponsors were forced to start broadcasting them to makeshift press rooms set up for the overflowing news media. The house parties are now more like reality TV shows, in which average citizens attempt to behave normally under the glare of dozens of cameras. The decisions the voters make next week will be the product of weeks of exposure to TV ads and national spin.
None of this is the fault of the candidates, the voters or the state. But New Hampshire's argument for going first was that it offered special added value. Now that's gone. It is time for the parties to stop pretending there is a way to funnel the modern presidential nominating process into the mold of intimate one-on-one campaigning. Next time around, the candidates should be sent through a series of large regional primaries. Now that intimacy is impossible, it's time to give as many voters as possible a chance to be in on the start.
