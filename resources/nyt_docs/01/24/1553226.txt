Japan's all-industry index fell a larger-than-expected 1.3 percent in November from October, as warmer weather hurt sales of winter goods and construction and public spending declined. The index, a proxy for gross domestic product, last fell in July. However, economists expect the index to surge to a seven-year high in the quarter ended in December, a sign that recovery in Japan remains intact.
