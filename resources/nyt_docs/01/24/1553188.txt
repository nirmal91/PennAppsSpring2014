A century ago, when Jacob Riis wielded photojournalism to document the hovels and miseries of the city's poor, he sought to haunt New Yorkers with a poet's question:
Think ye that building shall endure
Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor?
The question remains timeless for thousands of modern New Yorkers whose generous contributions to this newspaper's Neediest Cases Fund have been heartening proof in these past three months that the spiritual descendants of Riis are legion.
There is a perpetual tension between the city's noble progression and the crushing burdens faced by the poor. Charity is a proven resolution, and every penny donated to the fund is being channeled to seven of the city's most time-honored charities. The lives of New Yorkers bolstered by your donations have been chronicled in recent weeks: A jobless family sleeps in their car in a desperate attempt to keep a daughter in college. A neighborhood matriarch is gunned down, and her family reels. They are our city neighbors, the souls of Riis's haunting question.
Last year was not the best of economic times. The Neediest Cases drive registered a drop in donors and funds over the previous year. Even so, at $7.5 million and counting, the public's commitment to charity is a resolute reply to Riis. And the fund, which has endured 92 years, through New York's thick and thin, has days to go before closing at the end of the month.
