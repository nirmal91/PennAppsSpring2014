To the Editor:
Re ''Death and the City,'' by Wilson H. Beebe Jr. (Op-Ed, Jan. 17):
The New York City Health Department issues death certificates and permits 24 hours a day.
Death registration could be improved with an electronic system, but no such satisfactory system exists anywhere in the country. No state has an electronic death registration system that meets New York City's needs for security, confidentiality and performance.
Death registration in the United States is complicated; it serves essential legal and public health purposes. It also has to function during emergencies like 9/11 and blackouts; prevent fraud and protect confidentiality; and meet the needs of all families, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and funeral homes, large and small.
We are building an electronic death registration system to do just that.
