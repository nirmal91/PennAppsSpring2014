Seven days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Yue Huan Feng arrived in New York City from China six months pregnant. One of the places she went on her first day in the United States was the World Trade Center, because she understood that she could find work in that area as a street vendor.
Ms. Feng, now 36, was working near the twin towers on the morning of Sept. 11. She said she ''started running with everyone else.''
''At that time I was illegal,'' she said, ''and I was afraid to ask for any kind of assistance even though my baby was on its way to be born.''
Ms. Feng's life has been one of fear and turmoil for some time. Sept. 11 was just one in a series of hardships and challenges she has faced since coming to America to escape a forced abortion under China's one-child policy. She left behind her husband and their son. Now she has their second child, Wen Bin Tan, 2, but not much else.
Ms. Feng lives in a family shelter, and Wen Bin Tan, who speaks neither English nor Chinese, shows signs of slow language development. While she waits for a reunion with her husband and other son, she is unable to work because she has pain in her chest and legs and is on medication to thin her blood and prevent her from developing blood cancer.
Still, ''My life right now is much better than it was in the past,'' Ms. Feng said in an interview translated by Ge Li, her case manager at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York. The organization is one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In the spring of 2001, Ms. Feng was working at a bank in the city of Xinhui in Guangdong Province, where she lived with her husband, Hua Sheng Tan, 41, and their son, Jian Min Tan, 10. Ms. Feng and her husband pooled their money for a visa for her to go the United States. She learned that a friend of a friend lived in Flushing, Queens, which led her to New York. She said her acquaintance ''let me stay on the sofa in his apartment for three nights.'' After that she moved into a motel in Flushing where four other Chinese people were sharing one room and her share of the rent would be $200 a month. She sold batteries, hats, T-shirts and souvenirs on the street to make money.
After Sept. 11, Ms. Feng said, the government's increased interest in finding undocumented workers led her roommates to worry that the birth of her son would bring attention to their illegal status. ''They were afraid when the baby came that the ambulance would arrive and then maybe the police,'' she explained. ''They tried to kick me out.''
On Dec. 24, 2001, Ms. Feng said, she responded by holding a knife to her throat, threatening to commit suicide if she were forced out. They relented, she said, and the baby was born three days later.
When she moved to her own apartment in the Bronx in February, her living conditions did not improve. ''Inside the bathroom there was ice hanging,'' she said. ''There was no heat.'' She lived in that building until January 2003. She arrived home from taking the baby to the doctor to find the police blocking it off because it had been condemned. That night she went to the first of several shelters that she would find herself in over the next year. In April 2002, with the help of a lawyer, Ms. Feng was granted asylum based on her fear of persecution in China because of resistance to its population control policies. With her asylum status she can legally work and is eligible for social services.
To help Ms. Feng get her footing, the social agency Safe Horizon referred her to the Catholic Charities, where Ms. Li began addressing Ms. Feng's various needs from housing to health in June 2003.
Now Ms. Feng receives $213 a month in public assistance and $178 in food stamps. She is on an expedited waiting list for public housing. She was enrolled in the September 11th Fund Ongoing Recovery Program, which granted $1,500 for loss of income and a $2,500 gift check.
Meanwhile, her 2-year-old is in early-intervention day care. And Ms. Feng was enrolled in Medicaid.
For Ms. Feng, there are more challenges ahead. Among them, she has been on medication for the blood cancer. ''At night I have pain in my chest and it is hard for me to breathe,'' she said. ''Sometimes after I feed my son, I don't have the energy to eat myself.''
