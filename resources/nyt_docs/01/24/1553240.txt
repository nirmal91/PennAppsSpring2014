First Britain granted Boris A. Berezovsky, the self-exiled Russian tycoon, political asylum. Now it has granted him a new identity. Britain's home secretary announced in a statement that Mr. Berezovksy received travel documents under the assumed name Platon Yelenin, the BBC and other news agencies reported. Mr. Berezovsky, who is still wanted on fraud charges in Russia, traveled to neighboring Georgia last month under that name, prompting a storm of protests from Russian law enforcement officials. How the name was chosen was not immediately known. Platon is also the first name of a Berezovsky-like character in the 2002 movie ''Oligarch,'' loosely based on Mr. Berezovsky.
