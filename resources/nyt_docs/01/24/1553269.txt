A federal judge has instituted buffer zones around salmon-bearing streams where 38 pesticides cannot be used. The ruling by Judge John Coughenour of Federal District Court in Seattle is meant as an interim measure until the Environmental Protection Agency institutes permanent guidelines for pesticide use near salmon streams. Judge Coughenour also required that warning labels be displayed near some pesticides sold at home or garden stores in urban areas in Washington, Oregon and California, where runoff can damage water quality. The ruling was part of a suit filed by fishing and environmental groups.
