To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's Health Proposals'' (editorial, Jan. 22):
Being uninsured is not an inconvenience; it is a formidable barrier to obtaining necessary medical care. This reality requires broader action than tax credits and small-business subsidies.
The time to act is now. While federal legislators have been paralyzed by partisan differences, state-run health insurance systems are collapsing. State lawmakers across the country are raising the eligibility requirements and curtailing the benefits of programs that help ensure that all children have access to quality health care.
Considering that health care providers are also suffering from inadequate reimbursement rates while the demand for services grows, one begins to see a very bleak portrait emerging.
Quite simply, more leadership is needed on the national level.
