When Mistie Bass arrived at Duke in 2002 as a freshman center for the women's basketball team, she asked that her father be listed in the team media guide by his real name, Ernest Evans.
She didn't want everyone to know she was the daughter of Chubby Checker.
''People are going to find that out anyway,'' Bass said recently in a telephone interview. ''I'd just rather people look at me as who I am first. If they find out, then so be it.''
People are beginning to find out about the 6-foot-3 Bass, the starting center for top-ranked Duke. She is averaging 11.1 points and 5.3 rebounds this season.
Among her fans: Chubby Checker. He attended the Blue Devils' victory over Connecticut at the Hartford Civic Center recently and received a standing ovation.
''It's still good to see people still respect him, that he's still in the public eye,'' she said.
Bass is also in the public eye, although she has played in the shadow of the Blue Devils' all-American seniors, Alana Beard and Iciss Tillis. Bass expects to take more of a leadership role with Duke next season as she continues to emerge from her father's shadow.
''I don't really want to emerge from the shadow,'' she said. ''Hopefully, I get it to the point where I'm that famous. I think it's cool: we've got two family members who are famous.''
