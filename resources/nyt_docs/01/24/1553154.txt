To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (''War of Ideas, Part 5,'' column, Jan. 22) says ''there is no war on 'terrorism' that does not address the misgovernance and pervasive sense of humiliation in the Muslim world.'' This is presented as justification for our invasion and occupation of Iraq.
If our goal is to end misgovernance and the sense of humiliation pervading the Muslim world, it's not clear how rule by a non-representative occupying authority would end Iraqi perceptions of misgovernance, or how a seemingly never-ending occupation by a foreign invader would alleviate feelings of humiliation.
