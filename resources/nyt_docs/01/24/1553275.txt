An article on Wednesday about a federal appeals court's upholding of a New York State law that bans masks at public demonstrations misidentified the organization that handled the Ku Klux Klan's challenge. It was the New York Civil Liberties Union, not the American Civil Liberties Union. The article also misstated a word in a quotation from Judge Jose A. Cabranes. He wrote, ''The mask that the American Knights seek to wear in public demonstrations does not convey a message independently of the robe and hood'' -- not ''masks.''
