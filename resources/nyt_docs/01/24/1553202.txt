Re ''Make That Steak a Bit Smaller, Atkins Advises Today's Dieters'' (front page, Jan. 18):
The key to the Atkins diet is that fat is a very effective appetite suppressant; no drugs are involved.
Why assume that people who eat meat, butter and cream are going to gorge themselves?
The four busy urbanites in our family were carrying a total of 75 extra pounds before the New York Times Magazine article ''What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?'' was published on July 7, 2002. All that weight is gone: one less risk factor for heart disease for all of us.
If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the diet is pretty expensive, which puts it out of the reach of many people.
