The Jets lost another candidate in their extended search for a defensive coordinator yesterday when Ron Rivera was hired to take charge of the Chicago Bears' defense.
Rivera, who played nine seasons in Chicago, was the Philadelphia Eagles' linebackers coach the last five seasons.
Coach Herman Edwards said he would take the weekend off to assess the Jets' search and decide if he wanted to interview other candidates before making a decision. The Jets have missed out on seven candidates in their nearly monthlong search to replace Ted Cottrell, who was fired.
In a conference call with reporters before Rivera was hired by the Bears, Edwards said of his search: ''I'm not going to panic. I said from the beginning I want the right fit.''
Rivera's decision leaves Johnnie Lynn, the former Giants defensive coordinator, and Donnie Henderson, the Baltimore Ravens' defensive backs coach, as the only people interviewed by Edwards who have not gone elsewhere.
Edwards is believed to be interested in Eric Mangini, the Patriots' defensive backs coach, but he is off limits until after the Super Bowl.
