Lawrence M. Small, chief of the Smithsonian Institution, pleaded guilty Friday to a federal misdemeanor count of possessing and importing Amazonian artifacts made of feathers and other parts of endangered birds.
The 62-year-old Mr. Small, former president of the housing finance company Fannie Mae, entered his plea in Raleigh, N.C., where Judge Terrence W. Boyle sentenced him to two years' probation and 100 hours of community service.
The case largely involved a 1,000-piece collection of headdresses, baskets, necklaces, arrows, darts, musical instruments and other items made by Amazon tribes in Brazil. Mr. Small, who once lived in South America as a Citicorp executive, and his wife paid $400,000 for the collection in Cary, N.C., south of Raleigh, on Feb. 14, 1998, two years before he became the Smithsonian's secretary, its top official.
After photographs of the collection appeared in Smithsonian Magazine in 2000, the Fish and Wildlife Service received an anonymous telephone tip that it included illegal bird parts. Subsequent investigations found that of the 1,000 pieces, 206 involved bird species protected by law.
Mr. Small argued that the seller, an anthropologist, had described the artifacts as having proper permits, and as having been displayed at two museums before Mr. Small's acquisition.
But investigators also found that from 1989 to 1998, Mr. Small imported, without necessary permits, 13 additional items bearing feathers or other parts from birds protected under endangered species laws.
On Jan. 5, prosecutors charged him with violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In the agreement under which he pleaded guilty, he is required to forfeit his entire collection to the government.
