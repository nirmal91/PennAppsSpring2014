Trade ministers and ambassadors from 20 countries met here on Friday but made no formal announcement whether global trade negotiations that broke down last September would resume in time to meet the Jan. 1, 2005, deadline for their completion.
The World Trade Organization and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, are pushing to resume the talks, which are supposed to reform the world's trading system by reducing farm subsidies in the developed world that prevent farmers in developing countries from selling their goods in Western markets.
''More than anything else, we need a poor-friendly deal on agriculture,'' Mr. Annan told a gathering of business leaders at the World Economic Forum. ''No single issue more gravely imperils the multilateral trading system, from which you benefit so much.''
