To the Editor:
The rate of new diet books being published is rising as quickly as the rate of obesity.
Even the old staples, like the Atkins diet, are going through their changes (''Make That Steak a Bit Smaller, Atkins Advises Today's Dieters,'' front page, Jan. 18).
Could this possibly mean that we're moving (albeit at a snail's pace) toward a sensible diet?
As an optimist, I believe that one day this will happen, but not until consumers wake up and realize that ''fat free'' and ''low carb'' are not labels that mean ''low calorie.''
As a registered dietitian, I've been promoting the same diet for the last 27 years: Be generous and ''donate'' a little bit of everything on your plate. You'll drop calories and pounds and still get a chance to enjoy everything you like (including a slimmer body!).
