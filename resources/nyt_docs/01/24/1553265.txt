Senator Joseph I. Lieberman received a boost with the endorsement of two sister newspapers, Foster's Daily Democrat and The Laconia Citizen. The endorsement, which praised Mr. Lieberman as a fiscal conservative willing to cross party lines for the national interest, came on a day that the campaign released a commercial in New Hampshire emphasizing his support for removing Saddam Hussein from power, a position that distinguishes him from his rivals. Speaking to reporters in Portsmouth, N.H., Mr. Lieberman unveiled a new line, saying Saddam Hussein himself ''was a weapon of mass destruction.''
