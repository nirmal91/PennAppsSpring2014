In May, a New York cabdriver from Afghanistan was arrested after asking an undercover agent questions about buying enough explosives to blow up a mountain. Prosecutors labeled him dangerous and suggested he might be a terrorist.
Yesterday, the cabdriver, Sayed Abdul Malike, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to making false statements to F.B.I. agents when he denied during law enforcement interviews that he had been asking about explosives. But he told the judge that there was an innocent explanation.
He said he had, just about literally, been considering blowing up a mountain. He said he had thought of going into business back at home blasting for ''expensive jewel like ruby and jade.''
Mr. Malike, 44, said he had lied because ''I was scared and told the agent I had not been discussing the subject.'' He said he was sorry. His lawyers portrayed him as a victim of Islamic fundamentalists and said he was pro-American.
But the mystery presented by his unusual story was not quite solved. Prosecutors remained skeptical about his activities, which included buying Valium illegally from the undercover agent and trying to buy night-vision goggles and bulletproof vests. He is to be sentenced this spring, and Catherine Friesen, an assistant United States attorney in Brooklyn, told Judge Nina Gershon that the government planned to ask for a longer sentence than usual. He has been jailed since his arrest.
Outside court, his lawyers, Alan Gardner and Frederick L. Sosinsky, said the prosecutors still suspected him of being involved in ''sinister deeds,'' though they said the prosecutors had yet to present any proof.
The defense lawyers portrayed Mr. Malike as a hapless immigrant captivated by get-rich-quick schemes. Mr. Gardner said Mr. Malike was a ''sadly misunderstood, very depressed individual who was just trying to find a way to better support the family.'' He has a wife, two children and an ailing mother living in Pakistan, the lawyers said.
