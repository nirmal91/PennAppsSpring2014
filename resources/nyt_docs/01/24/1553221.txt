To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's Health Proposals'' (editorial, Jan. 22):
It was heartening to hear in President Bush's State of the Union address reference to computerized medical records, given the impressive potential of information technology to health care.
The need for coverage of the uninsured, reform of the malpractice insurance system and adequate reimbursement for hospitals and physicians are other key issues that would benefit from bipartisan involvement from our national leaders.
Our health care system does much, and its potential is great, but it needs the necessary investments to sustain it and realize its promise for longer and healthier lives for all Americans.
