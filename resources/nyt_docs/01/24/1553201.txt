To the Editor:
Re ''Make That Steak a Bit Smaller, Atkins Advises Today's Dieters'' (front page, Jan. 18):
Menus in restaurants often bundle high-carbohydrate foods with low-carbohydrate foods.
Serving staffs often do not have the authority to make substitutions, and negotiation of menu items is often difficult.
I suggest that restaurants interested in serving Atkins dieters offer some standardized substitutions for high-carbohydrate foods that come with main courses and place a slip of paper in the menu that says something like, ''Customers on low-carbohydrate diets may substitute a salad or steamed vegetables for French fries in main dishes.''
The same slip of paper might also contain some meal suggestions or low-carbohydrate daily specials.
