The sports car maker Porsche said it earned 118 million euros ($148 million) in the first quarter, an increase of 16 percent from the year earlier. Strong sales of its Cayenne sport utility vehicle fueled a 28 percent gain in sales. But the increase fell short of market expectations as sales of Porsche's 911 and Boxster sports cars declined. Porsche said it sold 16,890 Cayennes in its first full year of the product. Sales of the 911 fell 26 percent, to 10,250, while those of the Boxster fell by 44 percent, to 5,250 cars. Porsche, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, said revenue in the period, which ended Jan. 31, rose to 2.82 billion euros ($3.5 billion).
