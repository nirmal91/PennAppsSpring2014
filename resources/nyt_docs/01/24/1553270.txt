The Department of Agriculture said three cows that were part of the Canadian herd that included a Holstein infected with mad cow disease have been tracked to a site in Burley, Idaho. Cows from the herd have now been found in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Agriculture officials said animals could not leave or enter the Burley site.
