A children's hospital in Montreal was flooded with 4,500 phone calls from parents in response to a warning that a physician there had performed thousands of surgeries while infected with the AIDS virus. Officials at Ste.-Justine Hospital said the risk of contracting the virus from the doctor was low but asked 2,614 former patients who were operated on from 1990 to 2003 to take an H.I.V. test. The patients were being contacted by registered letters, and the hospital set up a hot line to handle the calls. The doctor, Maria Di Lorenzo, who died in August at age 48, was cleared in 1991 by an expert committee of other doctors at the hospital to continue to perform surgery. The hospital administration learned of her condition just two weeks ago from another staff member.
