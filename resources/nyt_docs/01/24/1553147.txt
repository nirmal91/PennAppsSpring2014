To the Editor:
Re ''Riding the Crazy Train'' (column, Jan. 22):
As an Italian, I am deeply offended by Maureen Dowd's reference to Italy as a ''poodle'' and ''lackey'' of the United States.
Italy has a democratic government, which freely decided to support the United States in its effort to bring peace to the desperate and tyrannical country of Iraq.
Nineteen Italians fell with honor in Nasiriya while helping the people rebuild a free and democratic state. They weren't anyone's lackeys, just free men doing their duty, as decided by a free government.
