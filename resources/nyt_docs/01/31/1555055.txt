To the Editor:
Re ''Whoever Is Chosen, Democrats Spoil for a Fight'' (Political Memo, front page, Jan. 30):
Howard Dean's campaign for the the presidency has no doubt reminded many baby boomers of Eugene McCarthy's quest in 1968.
The similarities are there: a candidate's early opposition to a war, a legion of young volunteers, and a surprising early success in energizing voters that emboldened Democratic rivals to copy his message.
The familiarity of Dr. Dean's remark that ''the truth is I stood up for that message when nobody else would'' brought me back in time and sent me scurrying to the recesses of my closet for my stash of political memorabilia.
There I found it: the campaign poster from 36 years ago with a picture of Senator McCarthy standing by himself on an expanse of cobblestones and bearing the simple message, ''He stood up alone and something happened.''
Perhaps that will also be Dr. Dean's legacy, however the nomination fight turns out.
