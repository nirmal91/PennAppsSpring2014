To the Editor:
Re Andr√©s Martinez's Jan. 30 Editorial Observer: The purpose of the ''high-flying dot-com companies'' was to make money for their founders. The purpose of Howard Dean's campaign is to restore integrity, honor and fiscal sanity to our country.
When the dot-coms failed, the employees moved on to other lines of work. If Howard Dean's campaign fails, at least I'll know that there are tens of thousands of others who will continue to work to save our democracy from the Bush corporate takeover.
