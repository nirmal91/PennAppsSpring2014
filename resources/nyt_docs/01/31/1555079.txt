A witness appearing under the alias Hamid Reza Zakeri and claiming to be a defected Iranian spy told a court in Hamburg that Abdelghani Mzoudi, a Moroccan on trial for involvement in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, was trained as an encryption expert in an Iranian-backed terrorist camp. But after questioning by the judges and defense lawyers, a prosecutor acknowledged contradictions in the man's testimony. A verdict is expected next week.
