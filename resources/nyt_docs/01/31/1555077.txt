The Supreme Court ruled that parents have the right to spank their children, but said that the children must not be under 2 or over 12 years of age and that the force used be limited. Children's rights advocates had sought to abolish such punishment, but the court said that children were protected from abuse and that opening parents to criminal charges for using limited force would do more harm to children than good.
