To the Editor:
I would like to thank Paul Krugman and Bob Herbert (columns, Jan. 30) for their continuing efforts to bring the Bush administration's malfeasance to our attention by their research into the details of evil and corruption (my words, not theirs). I think the administration gets away with it because we are in denial -- similar to the clergy scandal. We just can't believe that those whom we would wish to admire and respect use words like God and democracy as a cover for ambitions toward world dominance or personal gain, or both.
