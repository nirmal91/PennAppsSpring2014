Yukos Oil reported higher third-quarter earnings, and its results appeared to show that its bottom line has so far not been affected by the investigation of its former chief executive and largest shareholders. Yukos said it earned $1.32 billion in the quarter, up from $850 million a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Sept. 30, rose to $4.48 billion from $3.38 billion. Executives forecast a 10 percent increase in crude output for 2004.
