Ed Moses, who has broken 11 world swimming records, thinks he can do just about anything. So far, no one has proved otherwise.
When he was 11 years old in Burke, Va., he gave up competitive swimming because, he says, ''it wasn't fun, and all my close friends were doing something else.'' He started playing basketball, baseball and soccer, among other sports.
As a senior in high school, he was captain of the golf team. He wanted to stay in shape for golf during the winter, so in November 1998 he started swimming again. Three months later, he broke the Pan American Games record for the 100-meter breaststroke. A year after that, he was ranked No. 1 in the world. Three months after that, he won a gold and a silver medal in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Now, at 23, his mission is to win three gold medals at the Athens Olympics in August.
He is swimming at the Nassau County Aquatic Center in the World Cup short-course meet, which began Friday and continues Saturday. On Friday night, he won the 50-meter breaststroke in 26.85 seconds, and 80 minutes later the 200 breaststroke in 2 minutes 4.61 seconds -- both times the fastest swum in the United States.
Moses has a 3.36 grade-point average in exercise physiology at Virginia, where he expects to graduate in May. He is ambitious. There are more worlds to conquer.
''After swimming,'' he said in an interview, ''I want to get on the PGA Tour. I was a five handicap in high school. Now I play maybe once every three months in celebrity tournaments. I'm shooting in the mid-80's, but I think because of everything I've learned in swimming, about the effort it takes to succeed, I can drop that handicap down in no time.''
Unrealistic?
''No,'' he said. ''If you swam only three or four times a year, you would get those mediocre results, too. Anything worthwhile takes hard work.
''I have people 70 years old and 50 and 10 say to me, 'I would like to be you just for one day.' I tell them: 'Do you want to get up at 5 every morning? Do you want to train five hours a day, up and back, always staring at that black line at the bottom of the pool? Do you want to let your friends go out and have fun and you can't go?' Well, 95 percent of the time they answer no.
SPLASHES
The 32-nation meet has attracted 98 men and 94 women. In Friday night's finals over the 25-meter course, JENNY THOMPSON, on leave from Columbia Medical School, won the women's 50 freestyle in 25.15 seconds and tied MARTINA MORAVCOVA of Slovakia for first in the 100 butterfly in 57.87. CHAD CARVIN of Laguna Hills, Calif., won the men's 400 freestyle in 3:40.87 and the 400 individual medley in 4:11.78. JASON LEZAK of Irvine, Calif., won the 100 freestyle in 46.98 seconds, the fastest swum in the United States.
