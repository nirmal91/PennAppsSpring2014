Gov. Tim Pawlenty unveiled a Web site to assist Minnesota residents in buying their prescription drugs from Canada. State officials said they believed theirs was the first such state-sponsored site, though other states have also announced plans for programs to fill prescriptions in Canada. The Food and Drug Administration says buying drugs from Canada is illegal and unsafe. Mr. Pawlenty, a Republican, said, ''We believe that we're on reasonable legal ground.''
