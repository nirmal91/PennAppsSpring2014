A man who the police said robbed and raped a woman on the Upper East Side early Tuesday morning is believed to have similarly attacked a man in the same neighborhood two days later.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that the man may also have attacked two other women in the neighborhood this week. The first attack occurred on Tuesday at 4:30 a.m., when a man approached an 18-year-old woman and, carrying or pretending to carry a gun, forced her to withdraw money from an A.T.M. before taking her back to her apartment building and sexually assaulting her.
About 5:30 Thursday morning, the man approached a 25-year-old man entering his building and demanded money, then took the victim to his apartment and sexually assaulted him, the police said.
