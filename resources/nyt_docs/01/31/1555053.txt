To the Editor:
''Will We Remember 2004 as the Year of the Dean Bubble?,'' by Andr√©s Martinez (Editorial Observer, Jan. 30), was an insightful analysis of the Internet's power in elections.
It also illustrates the limitations.
The momentum required for an election is difficult to create. In the first phase, Howard Dean's campaign mounted an effective start-up, just like a dot-com. Cyberenthusiasm has its limits.
Phase 2 of the election process requires real votes and experienced preparedness. Venture capital and political fund-raising have a lot in common, and the old methods of political campaigns, like the old economy, remind us that the next round of capital from venture capitalists or political contributors is still governed by reality.
