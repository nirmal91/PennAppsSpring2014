The explosion of a weapons cache that killed seven -- and perhaps eight -- American soldiers in a remote village south of Kabul, the Afghan capital, on Thursday was probably an accident, the senior United States military spokesman here, Lt. Col. Matthew P. Beevers, said Friday.
There were no indications of enemy activity in the area, and so far no explosive device or booby trap had been found, he said. ''We are still thinking it was an accident,'' he said in a telephone interview here Friday evening.
Seven soldiers were killed and three soldiers and an Afghan interpreter were wounded in the blast. An eighth man was listed ''whereabouts unknown,'' as investigators have not yet been able to identify his remains, said a deputy spokesman, Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty. The soldier was with the unit at the site at the time of the explosion, he said.
The four wounded men were treated at Bagram Air Base and later discharged, he said.
All day, investigators were examining the weapons site in the village of Deh Ayeen, west of the town of Ghazni, to try to establish the cause of the explosion. They appeared to have ruled out the possibility that any Taliban or other insurgents were behind the incident, Colonel Hilferty said.
''The soldiers were working around a weapons cache near the village of Deh Ayeen when the explosion occurred,'' Colonel Hilferty said at a news briefing. ''At this time there are no indications of active enemy activity at the site of the explosion, but the incident remains under investigation.''
Investigators were trying to determine if the site had been booby-trapped, he added. It contained recoilless rifle rounds and mortars, he said. Colonel Beevers said the cache had seemed to be ''pretty old.''
The soldiers had been on a reconnaissance mission in the area and villagers had led them to the cache with good intentions, local government officials said.
