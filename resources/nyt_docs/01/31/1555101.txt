The Nassau County Legislature on Friday received subpoenaed copies of an agreement that settled a sexual harassment complaint against a deputy county executive and required the complainant to remain silent.
The agreement appears on stationery headed ''Thomas R. Suozzi, County Executive,'' though the text does not refer to him, and he did not sign it. Mr. Suozzi's spokeswoman, Arda Nazerian, said the sheet was a common county format but not his personal letterhead, since it did not list his office telephone number.
The agreement confirms part of the charges made on Monday by the Legislature's Republican minority leader, Peter Schmitt. He said the complainant, a 23-year-old woman, had told his aides that the deputy county executive, Peter Sylver, who recently resigned over fiscal irregularities, harassed and assaulted her when she worked as his assistant.
When she refused further advances, Mr. Sylver ordered her fired, Mr. Schmitt quoted her as saying. Officials intervened and promoted her to a higher-paying job in another agency, in return for dropping any complaint and signing a confidentiality pledge, Mr. Schmitt said.
Mr. Schmitt characterized the arrangement as ''a cover-up'' that shielded Mr. Sylver. Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat, denied any cover-up, saying the case had been investigated and resolved confidentially to the woman's satisfaction.
According to a copy of the agreement provided by a legislative official, the county promoted the woman to a $50,000-a-year post, a raise of several thousand dollars. She waived her right to seek recourse through anti-discrimination agencies or the courts.
