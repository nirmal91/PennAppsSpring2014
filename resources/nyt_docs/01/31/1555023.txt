On Thursday, Laura Bush announced that President Bush would ask for an $18 million increase in funds for the National Endowment for the Arts. If approved, this request will bring the N.E.A.'s annual spending to nearly $140 million. All but $3 million of the increase will go to create a new program called ''American Masterpieces: Three Centuries of Artistic Genius,'' which will include a mix of touring performances, local presentations and arts education in partnership with public and private organizations across the country.
It's impossible to argue with increased financing for such a valuable enterprise, although this announcement falls under the category of You Know It's an Election Year When. . . . It would be possible to take a less skeptical view of this well-timed request if Mr. Bush's budget priorities -- driven by unwarranted tax cuts -- had not trickled all the way down to local budgets and gutted, for instance, spending on libraries. It is all well and good to have the arts come to town, but they shouldn't find the libraries boarded up when they arrive.
The N.E.A., which has suffered for so long under the wrath of cultural conservatives, is following one of the few paths open to it -- the path to the broadest possible audience. Many have come to feel that is exactly the path it should be following. Still, this new budget request presents a fascinating contrast. In the mid-90's, the vice president's wife -- Lynne Cheney -- did everything in her power to de-fund both the National Endowment for the Humanities, which she ran, and the N.E.A. Now the White House has given the president's wife a public opportunity to soften her husband's image by announcing the largest increase in funds for the N.E.A. in 20 years.
