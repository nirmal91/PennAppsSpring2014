To the Editor:
The question as to why the president seems to get away with almost anything (''Where's the Apology?,'' by Paul Krugman, column, Jan. 30) is fairly simple to answer: It is the result of the complete trust in a leader who is offering moral guidance and problem solutions in a time of crisis and along with it the suspension of criticism and doubt on the part of the citizens.
But as the president's ''white knight'' image is starting to fade, more and more Americans begin to realize that theirs is a country that is departing from the cherished ideal of the ''good society'' projected both at home and abroad.
