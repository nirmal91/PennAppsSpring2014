The judge overseeing the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's fraud lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler told lawyers in a conference call on Friday that the trial he suspended last month would resume either Feb. 9 or March 11. He gave the two sides until Monday to agree on the date.
On Dec. 16, Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of Federal District Court here abruptly halted the trial the day before it was to end when DaimlerChrysler disclosed that it had failed to provide documents sought before the trial by Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, the Tracinda Corporation. The documents in question are more than 61 pages of handwritten notes made by a former Chrysler executive, Gary Valade, during negotiations on the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz of Germany. Judge Farnan described them as ''very substantial testimony.''
A court-appointed special master concluded last month that DaimlerChrysler did not intentionally withhold the documents, but Judge Farnan said on Friday that he would accept Tracinda's appeal of that finding, overruling Daimler's objection.
Judge Farnan also said he would consider Tracinda's request that Daimler be sanctioned or fined for producing the documents so late in the trial, but said Daimler could count on having to pay some part of Mr. Kerkorian's legal fees.
''I want to make one thing clear: that DaimlerChrysler, no matter what the briefing might indicate, is going to have some exposure for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,'' Judge Farnan said, according to a transcript of the private conference call.
In 2000, Tracinda sued DaimlerChrysler, contending that Mr. Kerkorian was misled into exchanging his 13.7 percent stake in Chrysler for DaimlerChrysler shares because he thought Chrysler was merging with Daimler-Benz as an equal partner, when the deal was actually a takeover.
Mr. Kerkorian is seeking $1.2 billion in damages as compensation for the premium he said he would have demanded in an acquisition.
