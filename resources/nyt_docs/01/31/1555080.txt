The senior American arms control negotiator, John R. Bolton, ended two days of talks without securing a pledge by Russia to cooperate with an international effort to intercept shipments of components of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as missiles. President Bush announced the effort last year, but officials said Russia remains concerned about the legal basis for intercepting aircraft and ships believed to be carrying illicit shipments.
