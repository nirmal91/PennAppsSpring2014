Older teenagers who engage in homosexual sex with younger ones may be subject to far harsher penalties than their heterosexual counterparts, a state appeals court ruled. Last year, the Supreme Court stuck down a Texas law criminalizing gay sex between adults at home and ordered the Kansas court to reconsider an earlier ruling holding the sentencing disparity constitutional. The state appeals court ruled that in the current case the differing penalties remain justified by ''traditional sexual mores'' and the need to prevent sexually transmitted disease. A dissenting judge called the justifications a pretext for discrimination.
