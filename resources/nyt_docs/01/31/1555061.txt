To the Editor:
Traditionally, the textbook example of chutzpah is the person who kills his or her parents and then pleads for mercy as an orphan. But now there is the Halliburton Corporation, which received billions of dollars in no-bid federal contracts, bilked the government delivering on these contracts and then evaded taxes on its profits (''The Halliburton Shuffle,'' by Bob Herbert, column, Jan. 30).
Considering the Bush administration's close link to Halliburton, it's a wonder the American public isn't up in arms.
