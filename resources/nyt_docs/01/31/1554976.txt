To the Editor:
Learning that the Egyptian reliefs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art would be temporarily without their protective glass (''The Mummy's Tomb, Unwrapped,'' news article, Jan. 28) sent me back to fifth grade, when I attended the Met's archaeology lectures for young people.
After every lecture, I walked through the tombs, intrigued by the tall, tight spaces and elegant, mysterious figures. But I also stared at that protective glass and that spot, way above my reach, where the glass stopped.
I was determined to become an archaeologist so I could reach above the glass, so I could (legally) touch some fragment last touched thousands of years ago. This desire kept me going through college and graduate study, but I decided to become an artist instead.
Maybe it was the images behind the glass that were really most important to me, or maybe I just found another way to be able to touch art.
