Japan's unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.9 percent, in December, the first time it has been below 5 percent since June 2001. The improvement comes thanks to a decline in bankruptcies and an upturn in production. The decline in unemployment should translate into an improvement in consumer spending later this year, economists said.
