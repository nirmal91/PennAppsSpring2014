An article yesterday about proposed guidelines for science classes in Georgia that delete the word ''evolution'' misstated the sequence of events preceding a news conference on the proposal by the state schools superintendent. The news conference was held on Thursday after an article about the deletion appeared that day, not Wednesday, in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The proposed changes were first reported Wednesday morning on the Web site of an alternative weekly newspaper, Creative Loafing.
