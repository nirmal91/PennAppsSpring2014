The Texas state Republican delegation will not have a luxury cruise ship to sleep on when it comes to New York this summer -- the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, abandoned that idea -- but it will have the Hilton New York.
After working with the urgency of a bride trying to come up with a seating chart that does not offend, the Republican National Convention announced yesterday where state delegations will be staying when they visit New York from Aug. 30 through Sept. 2 for the convention. The results of the hotel sweepstakes, which was a closely guarded secret, were released by the convention's Committee on Arrangements..
Mr. DeLay, a Texas Republican, had raised a few eyebrows when he planned to compete with New York's hotels by docking a cruise ship on the Hudson River and offering conventiongoers an alternative place to eat, sleep and relax.
He later dropped that plan, under pressure from many people, including fellow Republicans who said it made party members look like they wanted to avoid mingling with real-life New Yorkers.
But mingle they will in at least 25 hotels concentrated around the Midtown and Battery Park areas. Texas will share the Hilton New York, on the Avenue of the Americas between 53rd and 54th Streets, with Pennsylvania and Florida, two other states important to President Bush's chances for re-election.
''I think it's great,'' said Sara Gear Boyd, national committeewoman for the Vermont Republican Party, about her delegation's assignment to the Hilton Times Square, on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. ''It's clean, it's vivacious again. It's the New York experience.''
