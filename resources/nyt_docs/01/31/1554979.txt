If six no-trump is doubled, there are three likely explanations. One is that the double is a Lightner move, attempting to guide the opening lead.
A second is that the doubler has two tricks to cash, which is not entirely safe. In a famous deal played two years ago, an opponent escaped to the seven-level, and the doubler's partner did not know what to lead.
Finally, the doubler may be foolishly optimistic and may even help the declarer make his contract. This was the case on the diagramed deal, played recently at the Boca Rio Golf Club in Boca Raton, Fla.
Whether North's rebid of two spades, after his partner's response of two clubs to one heart, should be considered a reverse is a matter of theoretical dispute. Should it show considerable extra values? Or slight extra values? Or nothing in particular? North clearly belonged to the last group.
South was Jack Sonnenblick of Boca Raton, and he used Blackwood. When he located one ace in his partner's hand, he settled in six no-trump and was surprised to be doubled on his left. Such doubles are mathematically unsound, for they rate to have a small gain or a large loss. When they turn a plus score into a minus, the loss is astronomical.
Without the double, South's obvious play for his 12th trick would be a club finesse. As it was, South decided that all the missing strength must be on his left. He therefore won the opening spade lead with dummy's queen and played a heart to his king. West won with the ace and led a second spade, won in the closed hand with the jack. The declarer cashed his four diamond tricks and a top spade, reaching this ending:
On the spade king, West reluctantly gave up a club. South cashed the heart queen and played his top clubs to make his doubled slam. The unwise double had cost the defenders 1760 points, one point for every yard in the mile that West ran to escape his partner's wrath.
