Japan's banks reduced their nonperforming loans by 10.5 percent in the six months that ended on Sept. 30, as the economic expansion made it easier for borrowers to repay their loans. Japanese banks held 31.6 trillion yen ($298 billion) in nonperforming loans, according to the Financial Services Agency. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total lending fell to 6.8 percent at the end of September, versus 7.4 percent six months earlier.
