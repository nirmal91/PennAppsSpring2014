Canada's economy stalled in November, Statistics Canada reported, with gross domestic product adjusted for inflation unchanged from the previous month. Strong performances in the housing and energy sectors were offset by lower mining output and motor vehicle sales. Many economists predict that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates for the second time this year at its next review of monetary policy, on March 2. The Canadian economy grew 1.8 percent in the first 11 months of 2003, compared with the period a year earlier.
