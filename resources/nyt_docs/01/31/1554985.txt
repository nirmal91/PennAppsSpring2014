To the Editor:
''Patches for the Drug Program'' (editorial, Jan. 25) correctly recognizes the Medicare Modernization Act as ''a major achievement.'' For the first time, all people with Medicare can enroll in plans that cover prescription drugs beginning in 2006.
Beneficiaries choosing this voluntary benefit will have 75 percent of their drug payment paid for up to $2,250 in exchange for a $250 deductible and a $35 monthly premium. After beneficiaries have spent $3,600, Medicare will pay 95 percent of the costs. Some prescription drug plans may have additional options to help pay the out-of-pocket costs.
Extra help will be available for those with low incomes and limited assets. In addition, the new law encourages private plans to negotiate the lowest drug prices available.
