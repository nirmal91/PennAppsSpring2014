Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who has been courted in recent weeks for lobbying positions with the motion picture and pharmaceutical industries, expects to leave public life this year, his spokesman said Friday.
''He has pretty much closed the door on the idea of running for re-election,'' said the spokesman, Ken Johnson, confirming a report first published in The New Orleans Times-Picayune. ''He has left it open a crack, just to see how he feels in the coming weeks, but he has pretty much decided in his own mind to move on.''
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Tauzin, 60, was a force in pushing last year's Medicare and energy bills through. He has long hinted he would resign, and many on Capitol Hill expected him to accept an offer to run the Motion Picture Association of America, the trade group representing the movie industry.
But health issues, including a bleeding ulcer that sent him to the hospital twice in the past two months, persuaded Mr. Tauzin to turn down the motion picture job, and also to leave Congress, Mr. Johnson said.
Recent reports that Mr. Tauzin is entertaining an offer to run Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as Pharma, have prompted criticism from House Democrats, who are calling it a conflict of interest.
