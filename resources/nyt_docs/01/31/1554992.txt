Throughout much of Kevin Doyle's ''Styrofoam'' -- a play in the Stampede Theater Festival at the Trilogy Theater -- the sting of the playwright's unyielding satire is softened by his gift for comic absurdity. But the last few minutes will leave no one untouched by a shudder of revulsion.
As Christopher (Dan Roach) and Jessica (Keri Meoni), a pair of stuff junkies in their 20's, read advertisements for luxuries from every section of a Sunday New York Times in Christopher's magnificent new high-rise apartment, two movers haul in his gear: a parade of glittery gadgets, each named reverently by the movers like saints in a litany.
These simple dramatic devices allow Mr. Doyle to quickly build an enormous catalog of folly, deception, waste, selfishness and stupidity among ill-educated, overpaid young professionals. (If there are aspects of modern American life he approves of, he keeps them to himself.) Christopher and Jessica are so self-centered that it is amazing they can sustain a dialogue. But in time you realize they are talking right past each other, a revelation that makes their lines even funnier.
Up to a point. A pair of scissors could have improved this work considerably. As the movers point out, the audience has already got the whole message halfway through, though Christopher and Jessica probably never will. After a while the idiocies of people who are mentally and morally vacant -- or, as they boast, ''cut free from the prison of history and culture'' -- begin to sound like a rant from the playwright.
The director, Brian Snapp, borrows some of his feints and collisions from old slapstick routines, but the four actors so enjoy exposing the faults of these characters that the old tricks seem tolerable.
The Trilogy Theater is at 341 West 44th Street in Clinton.
