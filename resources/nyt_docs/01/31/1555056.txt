To the Editor:
Robert B. Reich (''The Dead Center,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 29) has finally said what most Democrats have been unwilling to say: that Bill Clinton was a two-term president because he was a terrific politician, but failed us because he did not fight for traditional Democratic core values.
His Democratic Leadership Council has led us further and further to the right, away from the natural base of the Democratic Party. Thus, the party has been unable to build a movement.
If we do not correct our course, we will never take the presidency again, except with a terrific politician.
