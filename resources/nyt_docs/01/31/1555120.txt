Gov. James E. Doyle signed into law a bill allowing organ donors to deduct up to $10,000 from their state income tax for lost wages and other costs associated with their surgery. The legislation is intended to encourage residents to donate their organs by reducing the financial burden. The new law applies to any Wisconsin resident who donates a kidney, a lung, bone marrow, part of the liver, pancreas or intestine.
