To the Editor:
In response to ''Black, White and Yellow Cabs'' (Following Up column, Jan. 25), I sympathize with Danny Glover's plight: that taxi drivers refuse to pick him up because he is black. Although I'm not black, I'm a mother with three small children; my youngest is in a stroller. Whenever I flag down a cab, drivers inevitably speed right past me and pick up other passengers.
Of the cabs that do stop, the driver rarely gets out to help me put the stroller in the trunk. (Those who do receive a generous tip!) When the city stepped up its undercover crackdown on drivers who illegally refuse pickups because of race, disability or destination, were mothers with small children included?
