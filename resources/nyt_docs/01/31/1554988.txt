To the Editor:
Re ''A Wall Street Lawyer-Poet Unmoved by 9/11 Tributes'' (NYC column, Jan. 27):
Thanks to Clyde Haberman for including in his column part of Eugene Schlanger's poem about the inadequacy of the designs that became finalists in the 9/11 memorial competition.
Mr. Schlanger is right. It is too early to build a memorial. Leave the site empty. Leave it raw. Let another generation decide what to put there. We are too hurt to know.
