South Africa posted a higher-than-expected 5.7 billion rand ($814 million) trade surplus for December and an annual trade surplus of 16.6 billion rand for 2003, the government said. The 2003 surplus was down 22.6 billion rand from 2002. Analysts said the smaller annual surplus was largely a result of the strong rand, which has hurt exports. The surplus sent the rand higher, but pushed down the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
