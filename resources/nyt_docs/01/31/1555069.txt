The sportswear and athletic equipment maker Puma said that its net profit more than doubled for the third consecutive year, beating expectations. The company, based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, posted a profit of 179 million euros ($222 million) in 2003. Pretax profit also more than doubled, reaching 264 million euros. Sales rose 40 percent, to 1.7 billion euros. The results came a day after its bigger competitor, Adidas-Salomon, posted a 14 percent increase in profit, to 260 million euros. Hurt by the weakness of the United States dollar, however, Adidas's sales fell 4 percent, to 6.3 billion euros.
