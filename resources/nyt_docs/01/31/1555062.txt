To the Editor:
Terry M. Moe's arguments for vouchers (''How Vouchers Will Enrich Public Schools,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 24) are invalid, as they leave out a vital point regarding private schools -- they can pick and choose the students they wish. The public schools do not have such a luxury.
A ''successful'' voucher system would cherry-pick the best students from the public schools, leaving only those whom the privates have no desire to try to teach. That is the principal reason that vouchers will inevitably lead to the total failure of public education, and why they are an idea that should be rejected by all those in favor of an opportunity society.
