A white woman who was arrested in July on hate crime charges after the authorities said she assaulted a 12-year-old Hispanic girl in a nearly all-white enclave, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in State Supreme Court in Queens yesterday and was ordered to take anger management training, Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney, said.
The woman, Donna Harding, a 41-year-old budget analyst from Breezy Point, Queens, was accused of using racial epithets after she encountered the girl and her mother outside a bar in Breezy Point, a gated community on the western tip of the Rockaways. The girl and her mother were the guests of a Breezy Point resident, officials have said.The original, more serious charges against Ms. Harding were dismissed after she and the victim agreed that Ms. Harding would plead guilty to disorderly conduct, a spokesman for Mr. Brown said. Those charges included third-degree assault as a hate crime, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison.
Law enforcement officials said Ms. Harding shoved a plastic wagon into the girl's legs and had earlier told the girl and her mother that blacks and Hispanics did not belong in Breezy Point and that they should ''go back to Orchard Beach'' in the Bronx.
