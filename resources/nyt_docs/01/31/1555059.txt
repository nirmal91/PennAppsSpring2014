To the Editor:
Catching my eye in ''Where's the Apology?'' (column, Jan. 30) was how Paul Krugman embraces the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report (could anyone expect such a group to support a war?) while rejecting Lord Hutton's report vindicating Tony Blair.
I find it fascinating to watch Mr. Krugman blast the Bush administration for using politicized intelligence (or ''cherry-picking,'' which seems to be the left's buzz word of the week) by using the same tactic.
