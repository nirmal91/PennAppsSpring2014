Nets forward Eddie Griffin is preparing to enter the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., where he plans to spend the next six weeks being treated for alcohol abuse, said his lawyer, Rusty Hardin.
Hardin met with Harris County (Tex.) Judge Mike Anderson on Friday and was told that Griffin could have inpatient treatment even though he is still under several court restrictions, including a curfew.
Griffin's agent, Arn Tellem, has arranged for Griffin to fly to Southern California next week and enter the center on Wednesday. Hardin is due back in court on Monday to review the terms Griffin must follow. Griffin, who joined the Nets three weeks ago, left the team Wednesday and told Nets officials that he was not ready to resume his N.B.A. career. He is currently staying at his house in Houston, and is keeping in touch with Hardin.
''Eddie feels he needs further help with his drinking problem,'' Hardin said. ''He's very disappointed. But he's thankful for the way the Nets have reacted to his request for further treatment. He realizes these are problems he's created.''
Griffin was involved in an incident Saturday night and Sunday morning at the Renaissance Hotel in Rutherford, N.J., where he was staying, according to the police. When Griffin knocked on the door of a hotel guest, expecting to meet some women he had met earlier at a wedding, the guest called the police. No charges were filed and the police called the incident a misunderstanding.
Before joining the Nets, Griffin was treated for six weeks at the Menninger Clinic in Houston for depression and substance abuse. He was convicted of marijuana possession last week and faces a felony assault charge stemming from an incident at his home on Oct. 25, when he was accused of punching his former girlfriend in the face and firing a gun in her direction.
