The Jets completed the overhaul of their defensive staff yesterday, hiring Doug Graber, who was once the head coach of Rutgers, as their defensive backs coach.
Graber was the head coach of the Frankfurt Galaxy of N.F.L. Europe for the past three years. He had been a defensive backs coach for Kansas City from 1983 to 1986 and was the defensive coordinator with Tampa Bay from 1987 to 1989. He posted a 29-36-1 record with Rutgers from 1990 to 1995.
