To the Editor:
''The Dead Center,'' by Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, Jan. 29), was on target.
The conservative agenda has been successful because it's easy to prey on fear.
Conservatives are fearful about what might be lost if gays marry, if the poor are educated, if child care is universal, if health care is provided and if the military budget is reduced.
Liberals are not fearful that the fundamental American bonds are about to break because we do things to help the poor and to extend opportunity to all.
Common sense tells us that we can improve and be hopeful about the future. That's what the Democratic Party stands for.
