To the Editor:
In ''Warming Up'' (editorial, Jan. 25), you say that ''a Washington Post survey found that only a tiny number of American companies'' have agreed to participate in voluntary programs to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
In fact, trade associations representing thousands of companies from 12 energy-intensive industry sectors -- accounting for about 40 to 45 percent of United States greenhouse gas emissions -- now participate in the administration's Climate Vision program. Nearly all these organizations have made specific commitments on behalf of their members to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity.
The administration has made significant efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions over the longer term. To meet the energy demand of a growing world population, lift people out of poverty and stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, new low-  or zero-emission technologies must be created and adopted by the market. The United States is leading the way in developing transformational technologies in carbon sequestration, hydrogen, renewable energy, nuclear fission and fusion.
