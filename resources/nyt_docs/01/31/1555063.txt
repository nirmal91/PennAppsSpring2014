To the Editor:
''How Vouchers Will Enrich Public Schools,'' by Terry M. Moe (Op-Ed, Jan. 24), is profoundly wrong.
Vouchers will drain away the best of the public school students. Those most able to afford a financial supplement to the voucher will send their child to a non-public school. Most of the children will go to parochial schools because the amount of the voucher is sufficient for the parochial schools but not for the much more expensive private schools.
The Ohio voucher plan that was upheld in the case of Zelman v. Harris by the Supreme Court last term saw 96.9 percent of the students given vouchers going to parochial schools, primarily Catholic schools. As the public schools get worse, less money will go into a secular education.
The primary effect of every voucher plan is to take money from the public schools and to put money into the Catholic schools.
