A court convicted two men on charges that they took part in the bombing of three apartment buildings that killed 243 people in September 1999. The court then sentenced them to life in prison. The verdict came after a two-month trial that was closed to the public and that did little to answer lingering questions surrounding the attacks, which some have blamed on the Russian secret services. The bombings of the buildings -- two in Moscow and one in the southern city of Volgodansk -- were part of a wave of violence that led to the second war in Chechnya. One defendant, Yusuf I. Krymshamkhalov, made his first comments on the case against him. ''It's all based on lies,'' he said in televised remarks after the verdict was announced.
