A man described by the authorities as an organized-crime figure was sentenced to jail yesterday on charges including extortion and bribery in garbage hauling contracts. The district attorney's office said the man, Anthony Piccolo, 58, of Massapequa, N.Y., was given a jail sentence of two and three-quarter years to eight and one-quarter years. He was also directed to pay more than $500,000 in cash and assets in forfeiture. The court sentenced Mr. Piccolo's daughter, Toni-Lynn Piccolo, 32, of Islip last week to six months in jail and five years' probation, but Mr. Piccolo had headed the multimillion-dollar waste fraud scheme, the district attorney's office said. The two pleaded guilty in September.
