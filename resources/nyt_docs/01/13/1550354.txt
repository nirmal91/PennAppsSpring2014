American soldiers on Monday night killed an Iraqi man and a boy and wounded four others in a car that was driving behind their convoy after a roadside bomb went off nearby, said witnesses, a police official and relatives of the family in the car.
The soldiers, traveling in a convoy of two Humvees, opened fire on the family, which was riding in a dark blue station wagon, after the bomb exploded on Palestine Street about 300 yards from the Oil Ministry, witnesses said.
The family's driver, a man whose first name was Haider, was killed, as was a 10-year-old boy named Mustafa in the seat beside the driver, said family members, a neighbor and a police officer. Mustafa's mother and two of his siblings and his aunt were injured and taken to local hospitals.
''You want to know the truth?'' said Lt. Muhammad Ali, an Iraqi policeman who was driving away from Al Kindi Hospital with several colleagues after taking one of the women there. ''I'll tell you the truth. The Americans did this. I know after this conversation they will fire me from my job, but that's what happened.''
By the end of the day, in violence around the country involving the American military, an American soldier and at least 9 Iraqis had been killed, and 10 Iraqis and 2 American soldiers wounded.
A soldier at the scene of the Palestine Street violence in Baghdad said that the bomb had killed two Iraqi civilians and wounded two others and that all had been in the blue station wagon. Capt. Jason P. Beck, a spokesman for the First Armored Division, which controls most of Baghdad, said three hours after the incident that he had not received a report.
Earlier in the day a roadside bomb in Baghdad killed a soldier in the First Armored Division and wounded two others, military officials said.
Another roadside bomb exploded near an Army convoy in Ramadi, a town west of Baghdad, but the military said no American casualties had been reported, The Associated Press reported. The report quoted residents as saying Americans had opened fire after the attack, killing two Iraqis.
The military also said soldiers killed 7 of about 40 members of a gang of smugglers that was siphoning oil from a pipeline south of Samarra, a guerrilla stronghold 60 miles north of Baghdad.
About 9 p.m. on Monday, suspected guerrillas fired rockets in Sadr City, a sprawling Shiite Muslim slum of 2.2 million people in northeastern Baghdad, Captain Beck said. Later, suspected insurgents fired two mortar rounds at the Baghdad Hotel on the east bank of the Tigris but failed to hit anything, a hotel guard said.
The events outside the Oil Ministry also took place about 9 p.m., when a bomb exploded on the median of Palestine Street after the two Humvees had passed it, said Feras Ali, 42, a resident on the block. The explosion shattered the windows of nearby houses.
The Humvees, which witnesses said did not appear to have been damaged, then turned in the wide road, which was slick from a driving rainstorm, they said.
Soldiers opened fire on the family in the station wagon traveling behind them, said the witnesses, relatives of the victims and Lieutenant Ali, the police officer. The station wagon crashed into a wall about 200 feet past where the bomb had exploded, and soldiers soon began pulling bodies out, the witnesses said.
About 9:20 p.m., more than two dozen soldiers from the First Armored Division were walking around the scene, inspecting the wrecked car, the ground and the area of the median where the bomb had exploded. One soldier warned a reporter and a photographer to leave the area, saying that ''something is about to happen that you won't like.'' A couple of armored vehicles sat on Palestine Street, blocking several lanes as rain continued to fall.
At nearby Al Kindi Hospital, in the room where three of the wounded from the car were being treated, a woman yelled at a visitor and a Palestinian interpreter as soon as they walked in. ''God curse the Americans!'' shouted the woman, a relative of the victims. ''God curse those who brought them to us!''
The woman's husband, Muhammad Abdul Rahman, 40, said his sister-in-law, Stabrak Abdul Wahab, was the mother of the family in the car and had been taken to a neurological hospital to be treated for her wounds. Mustafa, the child killed, was her son. Stabrak's sister, Hiyam Abdul Wahab, sat on a bed with a dazed expression on her face, a thick white gauze bandage stained with blood wrapped around her forehead.
Next to her sat two more of Stabrak's children, a boy and a girl, both also injured. Mr. Abdul Rahman's wife passed a bottle of water among the wounded.
''Hey, Muhammad, come over here,'' she said frantically. ''There's a bullet in her leg and in her chest. She's bleeding very badly.''
Mr. Abdul Rahman said to the visitor: ''The Americans shot them, but look, the problem now is there's no one to take care of them. There are no doctors, no treatment. This is horrible.''
A nurse said Stabrak Abdul Wahab had been treated in the same hospital for asthma earlier in the evening and had left with her three children and her sister. That was when they ran into the American convoy, the nurse added.
Also on Monday, riots continued in southern Iraq, as about 400 protesters marched on a government building in the city of Kut to demand jobs, The Associated Press reported. Someone in the crowd threw a grenade at Ukrainian soldiers and Iraqi policemen guarding the building, wounding five people, an official said. Ukrainian soldiers then fired into the air to disperse the crowd, he said, and wounded one protester.
THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: VIOLENCE

THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: VIOLENCE  Army Copter Downed West of Baghdad in Hotbed of Anti-U.S. Sentiment  By EDWARD WONG  HABBANIYA, Iraq, Jan. 13
A month after Saddam Hussein was pulled from his spider hole, and with the transfer of sovereignty looming, Iraq staggered through another disturbing day of violence and instability.
Guerrillas shot down an Apache helicopter here on Tuesday morning, while two Iraqi civilians were killed by American soldiers who opened fire during an anti-American protest in a turbulent town east of here, family members said. The Central Command reported that the helicopter's two-man crew were unhurt.
Even in the south, where the largely Shiite Muslim population has been more accepting of American rule, riots over a lack of jobs continued for a fourth day in the town of Kut.
[But in a boost for occupation forces searching for leaders of the insurgency, the United States military said four relatives of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Saddam Hussein's former vice president and the most wanted fugitive in Iraq, were arrested in early morning raids on Wednesday, Reuters reported.
[The four males were detained in Samarra, an area known for insurgent activity. Similar arrests preceded Mr. Hussein's capture. The military declined to identify the men or their relationship to Mr. Douri, one of Mr. Hussein's closest confidants and originally No. 6 on the list of the 55 most wanted Iraqis. U.S. officials placed a $10 million bounty on Mr. Douri, who they say has coordinated many attacks on American troops.]
The precariousness of Shiite support for the occupation forces has been further underscored by opposition from Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric, to American plans for creating a transitional government by July 1.
Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the American military, said initial reports showed that the helicopter had been brought down by hostile fire.
The attack took place about 9:30 a.m. near an American military base at Lake Habbaniya, which lies 50 miles west of Baghdad and is surrounded by dusty mesas and electric-green patches of farmland.
Like other parts of the so-called Sunni triangle, this entire area remains virulently anti-American, as was evidenced by a protest that took place at noon in front of city hall in Falluja, 10 miles east of here.
During the protest, American soldiers opened fire -- possibly after being shot at -- and killed a woman and a man in a passing car, said family members including the dead man's younger brother, who had been in the car. The younger brother and his father were injured when the car rammed into a truck, and the father is not likely to survive, said a doctor at Falluja's hospital.
An American military official said commanders of the 82nd Airborne Division, which controls the area, had received no reports of any demonstration or related deaths. He said that a convoy in Falluja had been attacked with three rocket-propelled grenades at midday, and that three Iraqi civilians had been wounded in that attack and taken to the hospital.
All this adds up to a tense situation across Iraq that is keeping allied soldiers on edge. Since American-led forces invaded last March, 495 American soldiers have died, 343 of them from hostile incidents, according to the Defense Department. The number of deaths since the end of major combat operations on May 1 is 357.
General Kimmitt said the average number of daily attacks against allied soldiers had plummeted to 17 from a high of 50 in mid-November. There were just over two attacks daily against Iraqi security forces and one per day against Iraqi civilians, he added.
But several attacks on American soldiers have been spectacular, especially those in this hostile area, in Anbar Province west of Baghdad.
On Jan. 8, a rocket believed to have been fired by insurgents shot down a Black Hawk helicopter near Falluja, killing all nine soldiers on board. That happened just six days after a Kiowa helicopter was shot down in the area, killing the pilot.
Contributing to the tense security situation are claims from Iraqi civilians and police officers that American soldiers have killed innocent civilians.

On Monday night, a policeman and victims' relatives said soldiers in Humvees had shot at a family in a station wagon at the site of a roadside bomb explosion in Baghdad, killing two people and wounding four.
But General Kimmitt said in an interview on Tuesday that initial reports based on photographs of the scene showed that bomb shrapnel was responsible for the deaths and injuries. The military is still investigating, he said.

The incident in Falluja took place after a crowd had gathered in front of city hall to protest the detention on Monday night of a local woman by American soldiers during a house raid. The woman was released later that night, but that did not stop a crowd of irate Iraqis from gathering the next morning.
Naji Abid and his two sons, Mahmoud Naji, 20, and Ahmed Naji, 25, happened to be driving near city hall in a minivan when the American soldiers opened fire, hitting the car, said Mahmoud Naji.
''All of a sudden there was shooting on our car,'' Mr. Naji said as he lay in a hospital bed, his left arm wrapped in a thick bandage. ''I couldn't feel my legs anymore. Then I lost consciousness.''
Dr. Omar al-Rawi, a physician at the main hospital in Falluja, said Mr. Naji's brother Ahmed had died from bullet wounds, though he could not identify the bullets as having come from American guns. Mahmoud Naji broke his left shoulder and left leg in the crash.
''They were shooting indiscriminately,'' Qais Naji, 35, an older brother of the victims, said as he fought back tears. ''They even killed a woman who was standing on the balcony of her apartment building.''
That woman was shot in the chest, Dr. Rawi said.
