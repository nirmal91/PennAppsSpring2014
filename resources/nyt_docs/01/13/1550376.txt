To the Editor:
What David Brooks describes in ''Workers in the Shadows'' (column, Jan. 10) is certainly ''not all good news.''
What the mythical Sam, an undocumented worker portrayed in the column, faces under the Bush plan is nothing short of indentured servitude.
The plan as currently configured would be a frightening first step in creating a permanent underclass here in the United States to perform labor that Americans have traditionally shunned.
If President Bush and the Democratic presidential candidates really want to help Sam, they will provide the same opportunity to him that is shared by people in all free societies: a chance to better himself and his family by having employment flexibility and the ability to negotiate for a better future by removing the residency cap.
