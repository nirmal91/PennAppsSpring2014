To the Editor:
Susan Jacoby (Op-Ed, Jan. 8), in making her argument that this is one nation under secularism, ignores the Declaration of Independence, which states that ''we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights . . .''
And what of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, in which he refers to ''this nation, under God''; and what of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, asserting that for a man-made law to be just, it must square with the law of God?
George Orwell once observed that propaganda is as much a matter of what is left out as what is actually said.
