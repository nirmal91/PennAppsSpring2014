Seth Abraham left as the president of Madison Square Garden/Radio City Entertainment yesterday, the latest top-level change in the organization, following by three weeks Scott Layden's firing and Isiah Thomas's hiring to run the Knicks.
Abraham had no role with the Garden's teams but oversaw the operations, sales and business of the arena and Radio City Music Hall.
''Jim and I have been talking about this for some time,'' Abraham said, referring to James L. Dolan, the Garden's chairman. ''It really was mutual. We started discussing this some time ago, but it took time to work through all of it. I just felt Jim needs some new perspective. I was there three years and three months. That's a long grind at Madison Square Garden.''
Abraham, 56, reached a settlement on the remainder of his contract. His departure is effective immediately. He said he was not aware of any other possible executive changes.
He added: ''Jim runs the company. He's entitled to things his way. I think there's a premium on administration, which is what he's looking for.''
Abraham joined the Garden in 2000 as executive vice president, reporting to Dave Checketts. After Checketts's ouster as Garden president, his job was split between Abraham and Steve Mills.
Abraham said he got along with Dolan.
''I admire his passion,'' he said. ''He's so competitive, not just the Knicks, Rangers and Liberty. He wants everything to be perfect and flawless. It's intense when you work with somebody like this.''
At the Garden, Abraham adopted a very low public profile, like other executives of Cablevision, the Garden's parent company.
It was a sharp contrast with Abraham's news-media-friendly style when he was the president of HBO Sports.
