A publisher of an Arabic-language newspaper in Chicago was found guilty of conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of Iraq in addition to two counts of perjury. The publisher, Khaled Abdel-Latif Dumeisi, 61, could face up to 15 years in prison for his role in collecting information on Iraqi dissidents who were planning for Saddam Hussein's ouster and passing it on to Iraqi intelligence.
