To the Editor:
Susan Jacoby (Op-Ed, Jan. 8) heightens the importance of coming to terms with diverse religious claims in a country like ours without an established church. But it is critical that government and its leaders know that they are accountable to a higher moral order. We are still one nation, under God, whether this remains in the Pledge of Allegiance or not.
Secularity is to be prized as the basis of rational discourse and democratic government. Yet underneath is an ultimate accountability. This is acknowledged by all world religions and should be understood in a country that separates church and state, as ours does.
