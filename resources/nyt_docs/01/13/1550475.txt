Spalding Gray, the monologist, actor and raconteur of ''Swimming to Cambodia'' fame, was reported missing by his wife Sunday night, police officials said yesterday.
The disappearance of Mr. Gray was of particular concern to the authorities. Mr. Gray, 62, had a history of depression, was taking medication, the police said, and had attempted suicide in 2002.
His wife, Kathleen Russo, declined to talk when reached at their New York City apartment last night. She said simply that she had been waiting for information about Mr. Gray.
Mr. Gray's older brother, Rockwell Gray, an English professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he had learned of the disappearance yesterday morning from Ms. Russo. He said that he had last seen his brother around Christmas, and that he had seemed down at the time.
''I wouldn't say he was in a happy state,'' Rockwell Gray said by telephone from Missouri. But, ''it wasn't unusual. He's been in a fairly depressed condition for some time.''
As for previous disappearances, Mr. Gray's brother said that they were ''to the best of my knowledge, not something quite like this.''
Detectives were canvassing hospitals last night, providing Mr. Gray's description and checking unidentified people. Mr. Gray lives in North Haven, Long Island, but also has an apartment at 22 Wooster Street in New York City.
One block south of the apartment building is the Wooster Group, the experimental theater Mr. Gray helped found in 1977 with Elizabeth LaCompte.
Scott Shepherd, 35, an actor at the theater, said he had last seen Mr. Gray in December during one of the group's performances.
''He's been in bad shape for a while since that car accident,'' Mr. Shepherd said, referring to an accident in Ireland in 2001.
In North Haven, a young boy in pajamas was seen lighting candles in three windows of Mr. Gray's two-story, paneled wood house last night.
