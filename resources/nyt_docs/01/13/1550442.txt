The European Commission is ready to investigate accusations against Hollywood-based movie studios over a clause in contracts they signed with European pay television operators. Contracts between the studios and pay TV companies like British Sky Broadcasting and Canal Plus in France include a clause forcing the pay TV companies to offer the best price and conditions it agrees to with one studio to all the others. The commission has said it suspects that this provision is anticompetitive and inflates the price of movies on European television. A decision to open an antitrust case against the studios is expected later this month or in February, according to people close to the competition regulator.
