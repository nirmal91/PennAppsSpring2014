To the Editor:
Re the Scientist At Work column ''On Crime as Science (A Neighbor at a Time)'' on Jan. 6: Dr. Felton Earls highlights a significant phenomenon. When neighbors speak out against it, local crime can be deterred in perhaps a more effective manner than any other.
But what interests me is when members of a neighborhood or a religious, political or business group fail to speak up about the improper conduct of one of their own.
It seems that people are less inclined to criticize these transgressions even though their voices would have an enormous impact. Perhaps this is because many groups are formed to compete with others and to support their own narrow objectives.
