HIGHLIGHTS
BERLIN: HISTORY IN THE MAKING  After four years and a federal government expenditure of more than $30 million, the renovation and reconstruction of the 300-year-old Baroque building that is the Deutsches Historisches Museum -- the German Historic Museum -- ended when the keys were handed over to its staff on Saturday. The building, with nearly 25,000 square feet of exhibition space on Unter den Linden in Berlin, is to reopen by the end of the year as a home for more than a million historical objects and documents, rare finds from different eras and multimedia shows spanning more than 2,000 years of German history.
