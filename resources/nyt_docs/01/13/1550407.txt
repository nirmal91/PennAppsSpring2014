To the Editor:
Re ''Facing Up to the Inevitable, in Search of a Good Death'' (Dec. 30): A strong, communicative relationship with your doctor is the key to a peaceful death.
When my closest friend decided he was ready to die after a protracted illness, the hospital staff was unable to respond to his or my requests to help him. But once we appealed to his doctor to intervene, my friend was able to die as he had lived: with dignity, clarity and purpose.
