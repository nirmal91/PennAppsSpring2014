To the Editor:
Re ''Trials End Parents' Hopes for Autism Drug'' (news article, Jan. 6):
As a professional with 30 years of experience with children on the autistic spectrum, I can tell you emphatically that secretin does work with a segment of this population. The challenge is in identifying the characteristics of the child who will respond.
Autism is likely a catch-basket term for a number of discrete disorders with some defining characteristics in common. We must continue to identify the various subgroups in this population. It is through this definition that the group that responds consistently to secretin will be known.
This is not the time to give up on this important drug.
