To the Editor:
Re ''On Crime as Science'': It surprises me that the article didn't point out the danger of high-rise housing projects, which often warehouse and isolate people. This makes them anonymous and destroys the very sense of community that families need to cope with their economic and sociological problems.
Dr. Earls's results should be used to redesign housing in poor neighborhoods. Only in low-density housing can people get to know one another and develop the kind of relationships described in the article.
