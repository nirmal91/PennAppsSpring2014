A group of family members of World Trade Center victims announced yesterday the formation of the 9/11 Campaign, an effort to raise money for programs that will be associated with the memorial at ground zero. The immediate goal ''is to raise $9,110,000 by Sept. 11 of this year,'' said Monica Iken, founder of September's Mission, a victims' family advocacy group. The money will be used to create an endowment that can finance children's programs, conferences and other educational outreach efforts.
