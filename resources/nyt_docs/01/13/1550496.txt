The State Senate voted unanimously yesterday to confirm Robert S. Smith, a Republican trial lawyer from Manhattan and a financial donor to various Republican campaigns, to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. The Senate's action to confirm Mr. Smith, who was nominated by Gov. George E. Pataki, means that the court will retain a 4-to-3 Republican majority, said Gary Spencer, the spokesman for the Court of Appeals. Mr. Smith, 59, is a graduate of Stanford University and Columbia University Law School. He will take his seat on the bench today.
