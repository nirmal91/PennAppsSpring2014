To the Editor:
Re ''The Argyle General,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Jan. 11):
As a discerning New Hampshire voter, I am much more concerned with Gen. Wesley K. Clark's leadership abilities, foreign policy experience and vision for America than I am with what he chooses to wear on any given day.
Clothes don't make the man.
