To the Editor:
Re ''Land of the Toothless No More'' (Jan. 6): If improved tooth retention is a tribute to fluoridated water, as the article suggests, then the rate of tooth loss in a particular state should correlate negatively with the levels of fluoride in its water; but it does not.
The water in Kentucky and West Virginia is heavily fluoridated, yet 42 percent of older people there have lost all of their natural teeth. In Hawaii and California, where fluoridated water is served to less than 30 percent of the populations, only 13 percent of the people in each state are toothless.
It's not that Americans don't guzzle enough fluoride. On the contrary, a recent study shows, they actually consume too much, regardless of where they live.
