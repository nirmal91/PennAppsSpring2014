Is a ''good death'' still eluding too many Americans? A new study suggests that this is the case.
After interviewing the survivors of more than 1,500 people who died in 22 states, researchers found that dying patients commonly did not get enough pain medication and emotional support.
Families also complained that communication and even basic respect were often lacking from the professionals providing care. The report appears in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
The findings, said the lead author, Dr. Joan M. Teno of Brown Medical School, suggest that ''changing the culture of dying'' will require a vast amount of work.
Sixty-seven percent of the people whose cases were examined died in hospitals or nursing homes, and that is where change is most needed, the researchers said.
Poor pain management, for example, was 60 percent more likely to occur in a nursing home than in a private home where the patient was getting hospice care, the study reported.
About a fifth of those interviewed said the patients had not always been treated with respect. Compared with a private home, this was two and half times as likely to occur in a nursing home and three times as likely to occur in a hospital. Survivors often said that they, too, did not receive enough emotional support.
