An art review in Weekend on Friday about Irit Batsry's new video installation at the Whitney Museum misstated the screening date at the Gramercy Theater for her 2002 Whitney Biennial contribution, ''These Are Not My Images (Neither There Nor Here).'' It will be shown at 8:30 p.m. on Feb. 7, not on Feb. 2.
