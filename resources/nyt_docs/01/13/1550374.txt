To the Editor:
Re ''Workers in the Shadows,'' by David Brooks (Op-Ed, Jan. 10):
Those beautiful, beckoning words inscribed on Lady Liberty have been a beacon of hope for all, including most of our ancestors.
In this respect, making it easier for immigrants to begin to enjoy these United States is always a good thing. But the real dilemma is keeping this promise to immigrants while also keeping open opportunities for jobless Americans.
The real concern is that for America's corporations, newly legalized immigrant labor may cost less than hiring a jobless American. If we let this happen, we backhand our own citizens. If we do not, we deny Lady Liberty's promises, a dreadful impasse no president or political party should ever wish to confront.
