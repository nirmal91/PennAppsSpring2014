A new study that looked at the weight of teenagers in 15 industrialized countries found that those in the United States were the most likely to be overweight.
The report, published in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, raises serious public health issues, officials from the federal Department of Health and Human Services said.
The researchers took body mass index readings of almost 30,000 13-  and 15-year-olds in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and the United States.
American teenagers topped the list, with weight problems found in 12.6 percent of 13-year-old boys, 10.8 percent of 13-year-old girls, 13.9 percent of 15-year-old boys and 15.1 percent of 15-year-old girls. Lithuanians were at the bottom of the list.
A co-author of the study, Dr. Mary Overpeck of the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, said the results were surprisingly bad, given the similarities between the American diet and that of other countries studied.
Although the researchers did not establish the relative roles of diet and physical activity, Dr. Overpeck said that diet was probably the most important factor.
''I think it's the prevalence of fast-food restaurants and the availability of prepared food in our country,'' she said.
Researchers in the Netherlands led the study.
