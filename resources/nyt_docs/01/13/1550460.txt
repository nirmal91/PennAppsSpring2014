The Jets, who lost one of the front-runners to be their next defensive coordinator when the former Buffalo coach Gregg Williams joined Joe Gibbs in Washington, have lost the chance to interview the man Coach Herman Edwards has wanted all along.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers yesterday declined permission for the Jets to talk to their defensive line coach, Rod Marinelli, whom Edwards wanted as his defensive coordinator three years ago and whom he was still hoping to land. Edwards, who worked with Marinelli at Tampa Bay, wound up hiring Ted Cottrell as his defensive coordinator and fired him two weeks ago.
Marinelli, who also has the title assistant head coach at Tampa Bay, has a year remaining on his Bucs contract.
The Jets' search will move on, with Tennessee's linebackers coach, Gunther Cunningham, being interviewed today. The Jets have already interviewed the former Giants defensive coordinator Johnnie Lynn and Baltimore's defensive backs coach, Donnie Henderson.
