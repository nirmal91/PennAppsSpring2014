To the Editor:
If Maureen Dowd had been writing from the frozen fields of New Hampshire, maybe she would be less cynical about Gen. Wesley K. Clark's decision to bundle up (column, Jan. 11). I was charmed (not alarmed) by the argyle sweater.
Furthermore, General Clark is continuing to attack the Bush administration's trumped-up case against Saddam Hussein, and he doesn't need to wear camouflage to do so!
