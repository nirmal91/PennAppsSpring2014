An anti-Bush advertising contest sponsored by the left-leaning activist group Moveon.org ended with little of the controversy it stirred last week after entries were posted on its Web site comparing President Bush to Hitler. The winner, chosen from 1,500 entries and to be broadcast next week, criticizes Mr. Bush on the federal deficit and argues that future generations will pay for it by showing children washing dishes, mopping a floor, checking groceries and slinging trash bags. The advertisement was submitted by Charlie Fisher, whom Moveon.org identified as a 38-year-old Denver advertising executive now working in Denmark.
