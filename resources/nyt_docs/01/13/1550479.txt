The E-Commerce Report column in Business Day yesterday, about American companies' use of foreign-language Web sites, referred incorrectly to those directed by the National Basketball Association toward overseas or non-English-speaking audiences. Eight are aimed at Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan. A ninth is aimed at Spanish-speaking users of the Internet in the United States, Mexico and Spain. There is no site aimed at Australia, nor are there individual sites for Mexico and Spain.
Because of an editing error, the column also misstated the title of an N.B.A. executive, Brenda Spoonemore. She is senior vice president for interactive services at the entertainment division, not a vice president.
