Q. I have heard that carbonated drinks take calcium out of your bones. Should I worry because I drink a lot of seltzer?
A. Not unless you drink so much seltzer that there is not room for enough calcium-rich drinks and foods in your diet, according to Dr. Robert P. Heaney, professor of medicine at Creighton University and a calcium researcher. Even plain water would present that risk, he said.
Elements of some other soft drinks -- like phosphates, sugar and caffeine -- have been examined individually and as part of the beverages and shown to increase the excretion of calcium in the urine, he said, but in the long run they have essentially no effect on bone calcium because the body makes adjustments.
''Studies have shown that caffeine, for example, leads to the excretion of some calcium,'' said Dr. Heaney, who did some of the studies, ''but on a 24-hour basis, the kidneys then throttle back and conserve calcium.''
The real danger, he said, is that soft drinks often displace calcium in the diet, and if you do not get enough dietary calcium, the body will take calcium out of your bones to meet its needs. Good sources of calcium include milk, cheese, yogurt and fortified juices.
