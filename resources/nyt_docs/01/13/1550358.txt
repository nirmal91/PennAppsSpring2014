Chris Wingert's frenetic month culminated Friday night in St. Louis when he was named the winner of the Hermann Trophy, awarded each year by the Missouri Athletic Club to the nation's top male and female collegiate soccer players. (Cat Reddick of North Carolina won the women's award.) There are more adventures to come.
''It's been hectic, but I haven't looked at it in those terms,'' Wingert said. ''I've been looking at it from the standpoint that I'm immersed in soccer now more than anything else. I'm enjoying it.''
Wingert, a 5-foot-11, 160-pound defender, helped lead St. John's to the final of last month's N.C.A.A. Division I tournament, where the Red Storm lost to Indiana, 2-1, in Columbus, Ohio.
After the title match, Wingert, 21, who is from Babylon, N.Y., on Long Island, returned to the St. John's campus in Queens to complete his undergraduate work a semester early in communication arts with a 3.79 grade point average. Wingert was also named the Scholar-Athlete of the Year by the National Soccer Association of America on Dec. 23 and is the first person to win both that award and the Hermann Trophy. He was also the defensive player of the year in the Big East Conference for the second straight year.
That is not all. Wingert is a member of the United States Olympic team, which is training in Carson, Calif. The team is preparing for next month's eight-nation qualifying tournament for the Summer Games in Athens. Those qualifying games will be played in Guadalajara, Mexico.
Finally, Wingert is likely to be among the top five selections in Friday's Major League Soccer draft, which will be conducted in Charlotte, N.C. Wingert would like to end up with the MetroStars, but his ''local'' club does not have a pick in the draft until the third round, the 21st selection over all.
''First and foremost, I want to get the chance to play, wherever I go,'' Wingert said in a telephone interview Sunday from California. ''The MetroStars would be a good situation. I know Bob Bradley. I've trained with his teams and I think he would give me a chance to fight for a spot. But they have four outside backs.''
Wingert played as a central defender for Coach Dave Masur at St. John's, but he is now more likely to end up on the outside, marking a speedy striker.
''The biggest demand when you move outside is being very fit and moving up and down the line quickly,'' he said. ''So in camp with the Olympic team, that hasn't been a problem.''
EUROPE  Too Much Vacation Time?
In Germany, Franz Beckenbauer, the president of Bayern Munich, wants to abolish the Bundesliga's six-week winter break. Meanwhile, in England, Sir Alex Ferguson of Manchester United, Arsene Wenger of Arsenal, Sven-Goran Eriksson of the English national team and the chairman of the F.A., Geoff Thompson, all want English clubs to get a break over the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
''We are the only country out of the top nations that has a break in the summer and the winter,'' Beckenbauer told the Munich newspaper Abendzeitung. ''It is a total luxury. I am sure our winter break will soon be removed from the calendar.''
The Bundesliga's 18 clubs last played on Dec. 17 and will not return until Jan. 31. Many clubs are now training in warm-weather locations, like Florida and Dubai.
By contrast, the schedule of English clubs is crowded over the holidays. This season, Premier League teams played 3 league matches in 13 days, beginning the day after Christmas (Boxing Day) and continuing through Jan. 7.
''Other countries in Europe have a break, and it would be very interesting to find out statistically if clubs from those countries do better in European competitions,'' Thompson told Agence France-Presse. ''I have a feeling they may do better.''
Leagues in Spain, Italy and France are off for about two weeks during the holidays.

There was no response to e-mail messages sent to Concacaf officials seeking comment.
