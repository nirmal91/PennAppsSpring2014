India's industrial output rose 7.4 percent in November, compared with 5.4 percent in October and 4.1 percent in the month a year earlier. According to figures released by the government's Central Statistical Organization, industrial output rose 6.2 percent from April to November 2003. Industry accounts for only a quarter of the country's gross domestic product but contributes a substantial part of the government's revenues. Manufacturing grew 8.1 percent in November compared with 4.3 percent a year earlier. With farm incomes increasing after a season of ample rainfall, the demand for consumer durables like televisions and refrigerators increased 14.1 percent in November compared with 1.4 percent a year earlier.
