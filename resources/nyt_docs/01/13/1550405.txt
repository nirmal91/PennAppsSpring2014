To the Editor:
Re ''In Search for Life on Mars, Machines Can Boldly Go Where Humans Can't'' (Jan. 6): The article argues that human space missions are virtually worthless when compared with sending robotic rovers. But for all their cost and risk, manned missions are valuable because they teach us how humans can survive in space, among other reasons.
Without a human presence in space, support even for robotic missions is likely to dry up. It would be all too easy to argue that the money spent on them is needed here on earth. But do we really want to set the political stage for abandoning space altogether?
