The last founder still at Merkley Newman Harty &amp; Partners in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, is giving up day-to-day leadership as chairman in a reorganization, the agency said yesterday.
The chairman, Parry Merkley, 52, becomes chairman emeritus while remaining a partner.
Also, the agency is being renamed Merkley &amp; Partners to better reflect its leadership; Jane Newman left in 1998 and Stephen Harty in 2001.
Four other partners at Merkley are taking posts that are being created in the reorganization.
Alex Gellert, 39, managing partner, was named chief executive. Andy Hirsch, 44, and Randy Saitta, 46, executive creative directors, were named chairmen and chief creative officers.
Douglas Atkin, 47, director for strategic planning, was named chief strategy officer.
