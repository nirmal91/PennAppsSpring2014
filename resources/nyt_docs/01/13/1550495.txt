Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg questioned yesterday the City Council's expenditure of $15,000 to investigate accusations of sexual harassment against Councilman Allan W. Jennings of Queens. ''I don't know why they're spending money on an outside investigatory agency,'' the mayor said, noting that the city has its own Department of Investigation to look into suspected misconduct. The Council said it hired the firm ADR Associates/JAMS to provide an impartial investigation. Mr. Jennings has denied any wrongdoing.
