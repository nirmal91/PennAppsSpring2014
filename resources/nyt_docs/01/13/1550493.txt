The Rangers will play host to the Islanders tonight and the Devils on Thursday night without left wing Chris Simon, who was suspended for two games by the National Hockey League yesterday.
Simon, whose 159 penalty minutes this season are second most in the league, was suspended for attacking Tampa Bay's Ruslan Fedotenko late in the first period of the Rangers' 2-1 overtime loss to the Lightning at the Garden Sunday night.
The 6-foot-3, 232-pound Simon was apparently angry that Fedotenko slashed him after Fedotenko had driven Simon into the boards with a clean check. Simon responded by cross-checking Fedotenko in the back and in the back of the head, then punching Fedotenko as Fedotenko covered up on the ice.
Also, Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier kicked Darius Kasparaitis but did not receive a penalty. The N.H.L. suspended him for tonight's game.
