Prosecutors brought murder charges against a 25-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in a Stockholm department store in September. The man, Mijailo Mijailovic, admitted the crime last week, prosecutors said. The Swedish police said Mr. Mijailovic denied acting for political reasons and told investigators he had stabbed the minister on the orders of an inner voice belonging to Jesus Christ. His trial begins tomorrow.
