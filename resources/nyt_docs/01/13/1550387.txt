To the Editor:
Susan Jacoby (Op-Ed, Jan. 8) is to be commended for calling attention to an aspect of our country's history that is rarely mentioned in public discourse.
That our history is replete with towering leaders who acted on high moral principles without recourse to religious belief as a guide is instructive.
This leads one to ask: Why must so many of our contemporaries require religious guidance and inspiration to be able to act morally?
