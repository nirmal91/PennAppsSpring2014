The United States Air Force said one of its warplanes on a training mission accidentally dropped an unarmed 25-pound bomb on British farmland. The F-15E Strike Eagle was flying over Yorkshire from its base at Lakenheath, farther south, when it released a kind of inert bomb used in training. There were no reports of injuries, and damage to property was limited, an Air Force spokesman said. The bomb was recovered.
