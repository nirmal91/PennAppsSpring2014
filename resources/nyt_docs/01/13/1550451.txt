Armed robbers tied up three people in a jewelry story here along a street bustling with pedestrians and window-shoppers, smashed the store's glass display cases and then fled with their plunder on Monday afternoon, the police said.
The owner of the store, along with an employee and a customer, were bound while a group of seven intruders ransacked the store, Concord Jewelry on North Park Avenue. The police said that much of the jewelry was recovered by Monday night. They said that five suspects were in custody, and that the store employee was being treated at a local hospital for facial injuries.
