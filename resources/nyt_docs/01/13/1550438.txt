George Steinbrenner hired somebody yesterday who can claim as many championship rings as he has: Jerry Krause.
Krause, the former Chicago Bulls general manager who presided over six N.B.A. title teams, joined the Yankees yesterday as a scout. The Yankees have won six World Series titles under Steinbrenner.
Steinbrenner is said to be placing special emphasis on this year's draft because the Yankees will have extra picks from losing the free-agent left-hander Andy Pettitte to the Astros. Krause scouted for the Indians, the A's, the Mariners and the Cubs before turning to basketball.
Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Bulls and the Chicago White Sox, has credited Krause with the 1984 trade that brought the White Sox Ozzie Guillen, now the team's manager.
