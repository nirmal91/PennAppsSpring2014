Gen. Wesley K. Clark said that if elected he would push Congress to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides workers with unpaid time off to care for medical emergencies or family members, to businesses with 25 or more employees, down from 50 or more. The change would cover an additional 13 million Americans. Appearing at the Londonderry, N.H., offices of the Stoneyfield Farm yogurt company General Clark said he would seek to expand the act to cover routine school and medical appointments and appointments related to domestic violence, increase penalties for wage discrimination and make it easier for women to build a case against discriminatory employers.
