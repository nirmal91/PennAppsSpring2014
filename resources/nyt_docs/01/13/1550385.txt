To the Editor:
Susan Jacoby (Op-Ed, Jan. 8) suggests that politicians should return to their heritage of secularism.
America has never been secular at its core, and I hope that it never will be.
From its inception, this country has been committed to religious values. It is precisely America's moral clarity that has set us apart from other nations and has made this country so great.
Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this when he visited the United States in the 19th century: ''Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power.''
Why revise our history when it's the source of so much good?
