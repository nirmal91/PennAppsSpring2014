Saudi Arabia began an all-news satellite television channel on Sunday, and a woman anchored the news. The woman, Bothaina al-Nasr, appeared in a head scarf and Western-style clothes. ''Leaders of Saudi Arabia are keen to show the Arab and outside worlds the real Saudi image and the intellectual and cultural developments in our country,'' the deputy information minister, Prince Turki bin Sultan bin Abdel Aziz, was quoted as saying in Al Hayat, a pan-Arab daily based in London. The newspaper said the new state-owned channel hoped to compete with Al Jazeera.
