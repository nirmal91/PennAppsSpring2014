To the Editor:
There is no need to debate whether President Bush should or should not have gone to war with Iraq (editorial, Jan. 11).
The preventive strike was clearly in the national interest of the United States. It was an aggressive warning to terrorist-sponsoring states -- especially Iran, Syria and North Korea -- that there will be severe consequences for their dangerous behavior. The United States also provided enhanced protection to Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, and sent a strong message to Syria and the Palestinians that there is no alternative to peace.
The United States assured itself of a favorable position on the availability of Middle East oil and freed the Iraqi people from a tyrant.
