Gov. Bill Richardson said he would ask the Legislature to phase out sales taxes on groceries and medical services and reduce them on professional sporting and cultural events as part of a larger restructuring of the state's tax code. The food tax alone yields more than $90 million annually to the state and local governments, and Mr. Richardson said he would work with lawmakers to soften the revenue loss when the Legislature convened in a week.
