To the Editor:
Thanks to Susan Jacoby for demonstrating the secular origins of our Constitution (Op-Ed, Jan. 8).
Another reason candidates should take religion out of politics is that suggesting that only people who are in some way religious should hold office conflicts with the letter and spirit of Article VI's command that ''no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.''
