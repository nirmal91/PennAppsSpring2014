Novell plans to announce today that it will offer to pay the legal fees of any Linux customer that is sued. Novell's move is the latest by computer companies supporting the Linux operating system to shield customers from the threat of litigation from the SCO Group. A consortium, led by I.B.M. and Intel, said yesterday that it was setting up a $10 million fund for any companies that are sued by SCO. SCO, which owns the license rights to the Unix operating system, contends that Linux, a variant of Unix that is distributed free, violates its license and copyright. Last year SCO sued I.B.M., a leading corporate supporter of Linux, and it has threatened to begin suing corporate users. Novell sold the Unix license to SCO in 1995. That contract, said Jack L. Messman, Novell's chief executive, means Novell has ''the right to authorize our customers to use Unix that is in Linux.''
