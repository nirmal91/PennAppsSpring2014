VeriSign is expected to announce today that it has been selected to provide a worldwide directory of the electronic identification tags that major retailers are being required to put on pallets and cartons they send to Wal-Mart Stores, the Defense Department and other big customers. The technology, called radio-frequency identification or RFID, allows tagged items to be identified by a radio scanner rather than by lasers sweeping across a bar code, and can handle more information. The service will be similar to one VeriSign provides for the Internet. Terms were not disclosed.
