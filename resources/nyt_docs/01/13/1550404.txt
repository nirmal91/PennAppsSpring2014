To the Editor:
Re ''On Crime as Science'': The article reminds us that the roots of democracy are collective action and mutual benefit. The most important influence on a neighborhood's crime rate, it adds, ''is neighbors' willingness to act, when needed, for one another's benefit.''
While Dr. Earls's findings may change the paradigm for fighting crime, the more significant lesson seems to be that we as citizens cannot let our experts and professionals run the show. Democracy, after all, is not about perfection but about stumbling together toward solutions on a human scale.
