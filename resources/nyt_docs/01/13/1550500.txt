A union representing 2,000 janitors at Fairfield County commercial buildings said yesterday that the workers had overwhelmingly ratified a new one-year contract. The contract will raise hourly pay for full-time workers to $10 an hour on Dec. 31, 2004, up from $9 under the previous contract, which expired on Dec. 31, 2003. The contract was signed by several cleaning contractors and Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. To increase its negotiating leverage, the union asked for a contract that lasted just one year, so it will expire on Dec. 31 of this year, the same date that the union's other agreements with commercial buildings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are to expire. Under the agreement, employers will increase their contributions for health coverage by $40 per month per employee.
