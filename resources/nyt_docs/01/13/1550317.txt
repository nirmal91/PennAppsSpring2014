To the Editor:
I was disappointed to read about the young women of my generation who champion vanity over compassion (''Fur Leaps a Generation,'' Fashion page, Jan. 6).
What should keep us from wearing fur is not some vague notion that it's un-P.C.; it's facing the reality that fur is not a ''material.'' It belonged to a real, feeling animal that had a face, a mother and a will to live.
If more women were willing to ''go there'' emotionally, we wouldn't see fur in the street every morning.
