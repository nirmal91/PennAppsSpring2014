The European Commission will seek permission from the World Trade Organization today to impose sanctions on the United States, because the nation has not scrapped a law that awards fines levied against companies exporting to the United States to their American rivals. The commission contends that the law punishes exporters twice because first they are fined and then the money is passed on to competitors. The trade organization ruled that the law, known as the Byrd Amendment, was illegal after it received complaints from several countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico and Japan as well as from the European Union.
