To the Editor:
I thought that Susan Jacoby's point was eloquently put in ''One Nation, Under Secularism'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 8). I hope that the Democratic candidates will pay attention to this and not fall into the trap of turning the election into a piety contest.
The Bush administration has taught me what religion is really used for in politics: to give people what they want to hear, as opposed to what they should know; to turn the administration's back on science when it suits its agenda, against mountains of valid research; to use religion to label anyone who opposes it as un-American; and to pass legislation tailored to its own particular beliefs, as opposed to deciding what is for the public good.
I, too, wish that the Democratic candidates have the courage to turn this issue around and use it as an example of how it makes them different from President Bush.
