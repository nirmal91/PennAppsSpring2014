To the Editor:
Re ''The Faulty Weapons Estimates'' (editorial, Jan. 11):
Isn't calling for a thorough investigation of the administration's claims a year ago about Iraq's threat like shouting into the wind when the executive and legislative branches are controlled by the same party?
Couple the reasons cited with the revelation of Paul H. O'Neill, President Bush's first Treasury secretary, that even before 9/11 Mr. Bush was searching for a way to invade Iraq (news article, Jan. 12), and there is enough fodder for an investigation. But unless TV talk shows and newspapers can affect public opinion, the administration's ability to sway public opinion with its spin will remain uninvestigated.
