Nine children and an adult have died in Hanoi since October from a rare strain of avian influenza that usually spreads from birds to people, the World Health Organization said. Three other children have survived infection from the strain, known as Influenza A(H5N1). Because some of the cases occurred in the same family, health officials are monitoring a possible person-to-person spread of the virus. Epidemiologists are seeking a possible link between the cases and chickens. Last year, the strain killed one person and sickened another in Hong Kong. In 1997, the same strain infected 18 people in Hong Kong, killing 6, and officials ordered the slaughter of all of the territory's 1.4 million chickens out of concern for an epidemic. ''We're always concerned when we see this kind of influenza appear,'' said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the W.H.O.
