Baseball players who spit, adjust their uniforms or move in and out of the batter's box have nothing on Peyton Manning, the Indianapolis Colts' quarterback. Manning's line-of-scrimmage, preplay activities -- a ballet of signals, gestures and feints -- is one of the most fascinating shows in televised sports. Manning is a strategic version of Ed Norton.
''As an ex-quarterback,'' said Phil Simms of CBS, an unabashed admirer who will call the Indianapolis-New England matchup with Greg Gumbel in the American Football Conference championship game, ''I find it embarrassing to see him prepare and wonder why I didn't do what he does.''
It was surprising that during Indianapolis's 38-31 victory in the divisional playoff over Kansas City on Sunday that CBS's Dick Enberg and Dan Dierdorf did not parse Manning's encyclopedia of movements as often as they should have. Ideally, CBS should have had drop-in features to interpret Manning.
Consider this play, the last one in the third quarter, and Manning's 13-second preamble: he approached the line, but raced backward before reaching it; then, he gestured with his left hand, gestured with his right, kicked his left leg, walked toward the line, placed one hand over the other as if to put them under center, yelled to the left, yelled to the right, backpedaled into the shotgun, kicked his left leg, got the ball and passed 17 yards to Reggie Wayne.
''It's so hard for the defense to stay in position without giving an inkling by a safety taking a step forward or a cornerback leaning a little bit or taking a false step to the line of scrimmage,'' Dierdorf said in his most detailed analysis of Manning's presnap routine.
Watching at home in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Simms marveled. ''I thought, 'He's checking to a pass, no, he's checking to a run,' then he smoked the pass from the shotgun,'' Simms said. ''I was fooled. I can play along with it, but when he did that he fooled me, so couldn't the defense be fooled?''
Simms said that Manning's intricate choreography is based on anticipating what the defense will or won't do, so he can call the appropriate play. ''I'm guessing that about 30 percent of the time,'' he said, ''he's just reading the body language of the defense. You look at one guy coming up and it looks like he might be blitzing. He'll say to himself, 'You're not going to blitz.' We've talked about it and sometimes we both think that looks so high schoolish. He has to decipher if it's a trick or if it's real.''
Simms broke down two elements of Manning's semiotics:
*Pointing at defensive players: ''It means nothing or he's pointing out who to block. It's also sign language to receivers who can't hear him.''
*Kicking his leg: ''All quarterbacks raise their legs, and it means to the center, 'Get ready to snap the ball.' But he does it as, 'Ready, don't snap, then he'll do it again and it means, 'Get ready.' ''
Simms said that teams tried to break down Manning's hurly-burly style and defend against it. Two years ago, Miami linebacker Zach Thomas came to a pregame meeting with the CBS crew and went through his analysis of the Manning oeuvre, as if he had translated the Book of Kells. ''I said, 'That's awesome,' and sure enough, he had him,'' Simms said. ''He'd studied him, got TV tapes, listened closely to the audio and figured him out. But this year, Zach didn't have the same read on Peyton that he did then.''
Random thoughts on playoff coverage:
*CBS should have used more high replays, with accompanying Telestration, to show how Manning was slicing up the Kansas City secondary. Too often, CBS cut to tight replays that did not fully demonstrate how open the Colts' receivers were and how faulty the Chiefs' defense was.
*Fox's Skycam and CBS's Cablecam, remote-controlled cameras suspended by cables above the stadium, often show terrific angles and can move along with the action. But the result of a long pass can be hard to determine, and could get lost in the corner score box.
*Just when it seemed Fox's Cris Collinsworth was not going to criticize the Packers' Brett Favre's overtime interception, a heave thrown without much thought about its destination, he said, ''That's the most ridiculous play,'' then added, ''You can't throw a ball into coverage without knowing what's going on.''
*Tony Siragusa's presence on the sideline for Saturday's St. Louis-Carolina game was a mystery. He cannot compete with skilled reporters and his occasional contributions are minor and only sometimes amusing. When the play-by-play announcer, Dick Stockton, chided him for recommending that St. Louis burn its last timeout before logic dictated that it should be used, Siragusa could only say, ''I'm sorry.''
