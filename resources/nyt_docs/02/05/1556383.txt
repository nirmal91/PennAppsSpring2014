Just as CD burners got faster at recording discs as the technology improved, DVD recorders are beginning to pick up speed. The Memorex True 8X Dual Format DVD Recorder can record DVD+R and DVD-R discs at a sizzling (for DVD) 8x pace. With the ability to store 4.7 gigabytes of data on a disc, DVD has become a common option for data backup as well as recording homemade video.
The True 8X drive also records other disc formats at various high speeds: DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs at a speed of 4x, CD-RW discs at 24x and CD-R discs at 40x. The drive reads DVD-ROM at a speed of 12x and CD-ROM discs at 40x and comes with a kit for either vertical or horizontal installation inside the PC. To prevent recording errors and wasted discs, the True 8X uses a two-megabyte buffer to keep the data flowing onto the DVD during the burning process.
The package includes the Nero Express software suite for all types of DVD and CD recording, from data backup to DVD movie creation. The True 8X drive works with Windows 98 SE and later on a computer with at least a Pentium III 800 megahertz processor. Detailed specifications are at www.memorex.com. Although the drive usually sells for $200, a $30 mail-in rebate is now available, enabling you to save a chunk of change while burning a hunk of data.
