To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman writes (column, Feb. 1), ''Many Americans, including me, believe in their guts that removing Saddam was the right thing to do, even if the W.M.D. intel was wrong.''
I would like to voice what I think many other Americans believe: that this country isn't supposed to sacrifice countless innocent civilians and hundreds of America's finest young men and women; lose the respect of the rest of the world; and abandon the moral high ground because of what anyone believes in his gut.
I believe that we are supposed to fight when attacked (we were not); when we are imminently threatened (no evidence for this); or to defend what's right (as the first President Bush did in the Persian Gulf war).
The leadership of this country should question the wisdom of pre-emptive war. And Mr. Friedman should give more weight to facts and not his gut feeling.
