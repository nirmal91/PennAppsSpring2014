To the Editor:
In your Feb. 4 editorial ''Bring Back Sousa,'' you describe Justin Timberlake's tearing of Janet Jackson's costume as ''an enactment of lust.'' I contend that it was, like the game, an enactment of rage. The line between lust and violence is thin.
With so many sports figures in legal trouble for violence against women, and with the prevalence of domestic violence in our society, it is patently irresponsible for CBS and MTV to even suggest that such an act is in any way acceptable.
It is not the display of semi-nudity that is offensive, but the rageful manner in which it occurred.
