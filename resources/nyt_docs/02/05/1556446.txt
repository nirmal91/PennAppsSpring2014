To the Editor:
Re ''Lieberman, Unable to Parlay National Profile, Quits Race'' (news article, Feb. 4):
Your assessment of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race reflects the problem with the national media's coverage of the whole campaign: process over substance.
It may be true as a tactical matter that Senator Lieberman ''frequently retooled his message,'' but the larger and more important point is that, however he expressed it, his positions never wavered.
Overthrowing Saddam Hussein was justified, Bush tax cuts for the highest income earners were not, and the country had to move beyond the politics of left and right and find creative new approaches to problems.
Most of the mainstream candidates changed their message on these issues several times as the political winds shifted.
If the media focused more on what the candidates stood for, and how consistently they expressed it, and less on the tactics and the horse race, voters would be better served, and Senator Lieberman would have been, too.
