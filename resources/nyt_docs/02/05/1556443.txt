To the Editor:
Re ''Keep the Primaries Going'' (editorial, Feb. 4):
You are correct to say the race should continue. But your treatment of Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Howard Dean is questionable.
Both remain serious candidates. To expect better results for Dr. Dean in Tuesday's primaries is unfair. His test resides in places where he is actively campaigning.
General Clark won in Oklahoma and took second in New Mexico, Arizona and North Dakota. Such results are amazing for a campaign that is only five months old.
The next debate should be a roundtable discussion where the four major candidates left -- General Clark, Dr. Dean, and Senators John Edwards and John Kerry -- can engage each other.
As you say, the time has come to abandon the stiff ''joint press conferences.''
