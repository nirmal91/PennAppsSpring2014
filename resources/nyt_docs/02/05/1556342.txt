To the Editor:
Re ''Antiterror Budget Rises, but Critics Say City Is Shortchanged'' (news article, Feb. 3):
Much of the debate about the nation's response to the age of terrorism has evidenced a very poor understanding of whom and what we are up against. This official whining about New York City's not getting its fair share of federal antiterror money is a prime example.
We could easily spend the entire gross national product of the United States on hardening New York City as a target. Our enemies would simply strike us elsewhere.
Let's just remember that we're all in this together.
