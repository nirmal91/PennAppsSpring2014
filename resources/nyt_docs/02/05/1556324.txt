Now you see the dots on Carolyn Ray's wallpaper, left. And . . . now you don't. ''We specialize in subtle geometrics,'' said Ms. Ray, a Yonkers artist, who was inspired by Sol LeWitt, Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse. ''I was trained as a painter, and I understand that wall cover is about background,'' she said. Snap, the pattern here, with 2 1/2-inch circles, comes in three colors, silver (shown), cream and cinnabar; another pattern has huge 27-inch circles. A five-yard roll is $134, to the trade only at Hinson &amp; Company, 979 Third Avenue (59th Street), (212) 688-5538.
