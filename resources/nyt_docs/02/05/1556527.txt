Five housekeepers who worked at a Midtown hotel have filed a federal complaint accusing a male supervisor of kissing and groping them, forcing them to work 16-hour days without rest, and requiring one woman to clean his house after work without pay. The housekeepers, all immigrant Hispanic women, were employees over various periods for the Broadway Plaza Hotel, at 1115 Broadway near 26th Street, according to the complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint was announced yesterday by the workers' lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union. The accused supervisor, Felix David Buendia Ramirez, has been suspended and will be dismissed if the accusations are confirmed, said Scott Walker, the Broadway Plaza's manager.
