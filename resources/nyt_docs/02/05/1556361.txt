Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary, said on Wednesday that he believed flight cancellations and other government actions over the holiday season had prevented a catastrophic terrorist attack by Al Qaeda.
While acknowledging the tensions created with foreign governments and the frustrations of airline passengers, Mr. Ridge said he was convinced that terrorists had planned to carry out an attack and were foiled by the actions of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
He said, however, that he had no intelligence to prove it conclusively. ''My gut tells me that we probably did,'' he said when asked at a meeting with reporters on Wednesday if he believed the government had averted an attack. ''But proving an unknown is a pretty difficult thing to do.''
On Dec. 21, Mr. Ridge raised the color-coded national threat alert level and warned that the danger of a terrorist attack was ''perhaps greater now than at any point since Sept. 11, 2001.'' Within days, several airline flights into and out of the United States were canceled as a result of what the government described as detailed threats to those flights. More flights were canceled last week.
Mr. Ridge said that the intelligence regarding the threats in December was credible and came from several sources that he would not describe in detail.
He said there had been specific threats to New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
