Spam-fighting experts have long advised having multiple e-mail accounts: one for personal correspondence and at least one for activities like online shopping that can be abandoned when junk e-mail starts piling up. But this is likely to become unnecessary with ZoEmail, a new Web-based e-mail service that incorporates patented technology from AT&amp;T Labs to block unsolicited mail from your in-box.
The user compiles a special ZoEmail address book in which each correspondent is assigned a unique ''key'' consisting of a customizable series of words or numbers. For example, instead of an address that looks like homer@simpson.com, a keyed address would look something like homer.snackfood@simpson.com. Messages with the special keyed addresses are allowed to pass through the system and land in your in-box, whereas mail without the address keys is blocked.
ZoEmail can import existing e-mail address books and send a change-of-address message, complete with key, to each person. Recipients need only save your new address in their e-mail address books to keep a personal key to your mailbox.
The address keys are flexible and can easily be modified, given expiration dates or discarded if a junk mailer gets hold of a address. The Web-based ZoEmail service (www.zoemail.com) works on Internet-connected computers regardless of the operating system and costs $12 a year for 12 megabytes of mail storage and 10 megabytes of attachments.
And what of those who wish to contact you but lack a key? A directory page on the ZoEmail site dispenses a temporary key to any would-be correspondent willing to type in a name and address to prove they are human -- and not a spammer.
