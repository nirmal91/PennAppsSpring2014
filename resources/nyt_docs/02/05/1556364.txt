While Washington was engrossed in a ricin scare and the presidential primaries this week, one of the most powerful members of the House of Representatives quietly announced that he was heading for the private sector. Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, the chairman of House Energy and Commerce Committee and the chief architect of the new Medicare prescription drug law, will now be looking for employment. It's a tribute to the ethically challenged culture of the nation's Capitol that speculation about his next job centers on lobbying for the pharmaceuticals industry.
Mr. Tauzin, who cited a bleeding ulcer as the reason for his retirement, has not yet commented on his plans. The options are almost limitless for someone with the power to get a return call or a favor from his former colleagues. Mr. Tauzin would theoretically be barred from directly lobbying Congress for a year. But he presumably knows that there are many well-worn paths around the House's flabby ethics rules.
If the pharmaceutical industry is indeed where Mr. Tauzin is destined, he could easily claim to have already earned his salary. The Medicare bill he championed is a lucrative windfall for the drug makers. And they will need a master lobbyist to protect their flank as estimates of the drug program's cost rocket beyond $50 billion a year.
The Democratic presidential candidates would undoubtedly be thrilled to get one more example of the way lobbyists hold the Bush administration in thrall. Perhaps Mr. Tauzin will decide to disappoint them, and take up a position that does not require him to sell the contacts he made as a public servant to the highest bidder. For Washington, such a decision would certainly be a nice change of pace.
