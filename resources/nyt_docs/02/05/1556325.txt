Are you one of those New Yorkers who are chronically starved for storage space? Do you have a bad back and have trouble getting out of a low bed? Bed risers are a solution to both problems. They elevate a bed from 5 to 15 inches by raising the frame or the legs and are sold in sets of four, $14.99 to $74.99. Under-bed storage boxes and drawers, in many sizes and styles (some on wheels), are $19.99 to $129.99. All can be found at www.stacksandstacks.com or (866) 376-6856.
