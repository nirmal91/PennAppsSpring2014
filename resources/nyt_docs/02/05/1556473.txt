The Sprint Corporation has entered a five-year multibillion-dollar agreement with I.B.M. to improve its customer service operation. Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., said yesterday that it would save $550 million over the next three years as a result of the agreement. Sprint will shed 1,100 customer service jobs in Nashville and 170 in the Kansas City, Mo., area, transferring them to I.B.M. The jobs of another 4,500 employees who now work for Sprint subcontractors will also be turned over to I.B.M. as a result of this agreement. Sprint said that I.B.M. would help it better identify the needs of customers, improve call routing and help the phone company solve customer problems in just one call.
