A four-alarm fire tore through a row of stores and other businesses last night, according to the police. No one appeared to have been seriously injured in the fire, which began about 9:30 p.m. at 3617 Park Avenue on the eastern edge of Union City, said Detective Jose Martinez of the Union City Police Department. Thick smoke poured from the row of burning businesses, and firefighters were still battling the flames at 1 a.m. today. The fire partly destroyed buildings that stretched one block along Park Avenue near the border of Weehauken. The stores included a hardware store, a karate school and a bakery.
