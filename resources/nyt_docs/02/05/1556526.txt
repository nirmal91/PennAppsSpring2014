''Anna in the Tropics,'' which received the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for drama, will close on Feb. 22, after a three-month Broadway run. The play, by Nilo Cruz, received generally good reviews when it opened in November, but struggled at the box office. The production, which stars Jimmy Smits, above, and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Cuban-American lovers in a Florida cigar factory in 1929, will have played 113 performances and 15 previews. It will lose almost all of its $1.6 million investment.
