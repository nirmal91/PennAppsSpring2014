Most people would say that $40 is a lot of money for a flashlight, let alone a replacement bulb. But Larry Lopata, the president of LEDdynamics, said that for heavy flashlight users, his company's solid state EverLed replacement bulb is actually economical.
''If you're using your flashlight every day, you'll find your savings from reduced battery consumptions come pretty quickly,'' Mr. Lopata said.
The high efficiency of the EverLed's light-emitting diode also makes it suitable for people who need their flashlights only for an occasional camping trip or a nighttime car breakdown.
According to Mr. Lopata, the typical incandescent krypton bulb used in a flashlight holding two D batteries dims by half after just four hours of use. By contrast, the EverLed is only 30 percent dimmer after 35 hours.
The EverLed is also brighter than conventional bulbs when a flashlight's battery is at its maximum power, Mr. Lopata said. And six colors are available -- white, blue, teal, yellow, red and green -- to suit the user's tastes and purpose.
The EverLed (links to online retailers can be found at www.everled.com) works with most flashlights that accept the standard push-in bulbs -- formally known as PR flange bulbs. The major exception are lantern flashlights that accept cube-shaped six-volt batteries, which generally have reversed polarity.
The latest version of the EverLed overcomes a problem that would concern anyone considering spending $40 for a flashlight bulb. The bulb simply won't function when it is inserted into a flashlight with reversed polarity. It will not, like the first version, self-destruct.
