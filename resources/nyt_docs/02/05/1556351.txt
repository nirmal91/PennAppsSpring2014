To the Editor:
I enjoyed your Jan. 30 Beijing Journal about winter swimming in China. As a longtime member of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, however, I must say that the comment ''and not just a once-a-year polar bear plunge for the cameras'' may leave the wrong impression with your readers.
The Coney Island Polar Bear Club, in cooperation with the New York Aquarium and the Parks Department, swims every Sunday, at 1 p.m., November through May.
It is understandable that many people think of us as a New Year's Day swim group, because of the annual media coverage, but please do not confuse that public event -- attended by hundreds of non-club members -- with the serious winter swimmers of the 101-year-old Coney Island Polar Bear Club. In fact, Beijing's weather has been positively balmy compared with what we have lovingly endured so far this winter.
