He had held many events here over the decades, but none was perhaps as bittersweet. A day after the biggest rejection of his political career, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut took to the stage on Wednesday in an ornate, intimate room at City Hall and told friends, supporters and local politicians that he was glad to be back.
Quieting the clapping and chants of ''Joe, Joe, Joe,'' he said, ''Running for president was a great journey, but it is very good to be home.''
Any sadness or disappointment Mr. Lieberman may have felt after quitting his run for the Democratic nomination did not show. Indeed, he told aides earlier in the day that maybe the pain of defeat would hit him later. But as he entered with his wife, Hadassah, by his side, he had an open-mouthed grin spread wide.
Mr. Lieberman recalled that when he announced his candidacy a bit more than a year ago, he promised that while he might not always know where he was when he woke up along the trail, he would always know who he was and what he stood for.
''Well, it's one year and I must say another amazing journey later and I'm proud that I've kept that promise even if our White House dream did not become real,'' he added.
He vowed to pursue his objectives when he returned to the Senate on Thursday. Speaking of a need for fiscal discipline and the importance of protecting the middle class, he said, ''I'm not going to be able to take those new ideas that I spoke about in my presidential campaign to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I will take them to the floor of the Senate and fight to see that they become law.''
Mr. Lieberman also expressed gratitude for the support of his home state. When he got off the plane Wednesday morning at the Hartford airport, he said, a group of people awaiting the next plane applauded him. ''They probably don't know,'' he said, ''how much that meant to me.''  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE CONNECTICUT SENATOR
