Apple iPod owners who want to share their sound, or simply take their headphones off, can plug their player into Altec Lansing's inMotion ultraportable audio system. Unfold the system, which is the size of a paperback, and you have a dock for the iPod flanked by a a pair of small speakers.
When placed in the dock, the iPod can handle all the data transfers and synchronization that a standard, free-standing iPod dock does; the dock can also charge any iPod with a docking connector. (Although it won't recharge them, the inMotion system also works with older iPods with a FireWire port, but not the new Mini.) Available exclusively through Apple stores, including www.store.apple.com, the $149 system can play for up to 24 hours on four AA batteries, thanks to a high-efficiency switching amplifier that delivers two watts to each speaker.
Despite its tweeter-size speakers, the 15-ounce system sounds as if it's producing impossibly deep bass. That illusion is created by MaxxBass, a technology from Waves, a maker of audio digital signal-processing equipment; it generates harmonics that fool the listener into ''hearing'' the missing tones. As a result, the sound you share will be a good one.
