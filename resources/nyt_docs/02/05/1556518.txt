A program listing, highlight entry and picture caption on Sunday in the Thursday pages of the Television section, for the NBC series ''Scrubs,'' has become outdated. As shown in today's listings, on Page E11, an extended episode of ''The Apprentice'' will begin at 8:40 tonight, replacing both ''Will and Grace'' and ''Scrubs.'' On Tuesday, Michael J. Fox will be the guest star in a special episode of ''Scrubs'' at 9:20 p.m.
