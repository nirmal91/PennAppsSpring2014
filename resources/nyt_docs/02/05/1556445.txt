To the Editor:
Re ''Door Is Open, if Not by Much'' (news analysis, front page, Feb. 4):
This year will be the first time that I have voted in an American election since voting for Gary Hart in the New York primary 20 years ago.
Based on the turnout in Tuesday's primaries, it seems that large numbers of formerly disaffected voters are returning to the ballot box.
President Bush may have used the budget to shore up his fringe-right constituency, but when he tries to tack back to the middle for the November election, he will find it already occupied by a determined Democrat and independent pragmatists.
