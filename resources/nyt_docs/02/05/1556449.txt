To the Editor:
Re ''Bring Back Sousa'' (editorial, Feb. 4): The most uncomfortable moment of the evening didn't occur for me when Janet Jackson flashed a millisecond of flesh (which my husband and son both missed, even though they were staring directly at the screen when it happened); it was trying to explain to my 10-year-old what Levitra was and why men needed it. I'm afraid that the mere mention of the words ''Super Bowl'' will have a traumatic effect on him for the rest of his life.
The female body is a beautiful thing. Male sexual dysfunction is not.
