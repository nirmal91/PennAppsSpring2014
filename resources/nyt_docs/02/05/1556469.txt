The country's political deadlock appeared closer to being resolved as former foes joined forces to elect a new speaker of the Parliament. A month after elections failed to give any single party a big enough mandate to govern by itself, Dragan Marsican of the pro-reform Democratic Party of Serbia was elected speaker with 128 out of 245 votes cast after his party sought the help of the Socialists, the party of Slobodan Milosevic. There is still no agreement between the parties on the composition of a new government.
