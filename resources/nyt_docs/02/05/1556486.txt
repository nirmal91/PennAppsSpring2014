The Oracle Corporation on Wednesday raised its bid to acquire PeopleSoft to $9.4 billion, or $26 a share, which is 33 percent more than the offer it made last June and $3.30 higher than shares of PeopleSoft closed Wednesday.
The surprise increase in the offer price signals a new stage in the hostile takeover fight for PeopleSoft that had appeared stalled in recent months.
But even at the higher price, Oracle still faces considerable roadblocks in its fight to take over its rival.
Oracle's latest bid is a move to put the PeopleSoft board in a tighter corner. At first glance, the timing of the new offer might seem odd because the Justice Department has yet to determine whether a merger of Oracle and PeopleSoft would run afoul of antitrust regulations.
Oracle has also said that it intends to nominate four candidates to the PeopleSoft board and propose that a ninth seat be added to the board.
PeopleSoft said in a statement that it was advising its shareholders to take no action on the revised offer while the board convenes to review it.
The new bid could give Oracle additional leverage against PeopleSoft. If PeopleSoft's board rejects the new offer without entering into any talks, the rejection could help stir up enough animosity among PeopleSoft investors to cause some to vote in favor of Oracle's proposed slate of directors.
Financial analysts said the PeopleSoft management would face a more difficult time rejecting the $26-a-share offer. Yet the market's reaction showed skepticism about the bid's likelihood of success. On Wednesday, PeopleSoft stock rose only 81 cents, to $22.70.
Even so, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, has shown tenacity in his eight-month battle for PeopleSoft, and the latest bid is further evidence that he is not prepared to retreat. By acquiring PeopleSoft, Oracle is hoping to better compete with SAP, the leader in the corporate software market, while trying to fend off emerging competition from Microsoft in that sector.
''This is our final price,'' Jeffrey O. Henley, Oracle's chairman and interim chief financial officer, said in a statement. ''We urge PeopleSoft directors to seriously consider our offer and put the interests of their stockholders first.''
Last week, PeopleSoft announced that it would move up the date of its annual shareholder meeting, usually held in May or June, to March 25. The record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote on the offer is next Tuesday.
It is believed that Oracle made the higher offer for PeopleSoft now to get more speculators to buy PeopleSoft shares in the next few days so that they can be in a position to influence the vote.
Oracle executives, who have long warned of increasing consolidation in the software industry, have appealed to PeopleSoft shareholders to consider the new offer, saying that PeopleSoft's long-term prospects are dim as an independent company.
Oracle executives said that they would not have proceeded with a higher offer if they were not confident a deal would be approved by federal regulators.
Those executives also suggested that Oracle was possibly willing to divest itself of certain assets or to guarantee support and pricing for certain products, or both, to get regulatory approval.
The new bid is a 62.5 percent increase over the original offer of $16 a share and is the second increase Oracle has made in its offer. Oracle earlier raised the amount to $19.50 a share. Oracle also said that it was extending its offer until March 12, from its current expiration date of Feb. 12.
An Oracle spokeswoman said that the Justice Department notified the company that it would make a decision on the antitrust questions by March 12.
''PeopleSoft's board of directors, consistent with its fiduciary duties, will meet to review Oracle's revised $26-per-share tender offer and make its recommendations to PeopleSoft's stockholders in due course,'' said Steve Swasey, a company spokesman.
PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., and led by Craig A. Conway, had rejected earlier offers from Oracle, saying that they undervalued the company and were likely to be blocked on antitrust grounds.
Since Oracle last increased its bid, less than 3 percent of PeopleSoft's shares have been tendered in the offer.
''This is the best example of where buying votes is fully acceptable,'' said Tad Piper, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. ''I think we've gotten into the realm of reason now. The other offers were low-ball bids.''
But the Justice Department's antitrust review and a similar investigation by the European Commission still pose considerable hurdles.
Mr. Piper said most investors think it probable that the Justice Department will reject the deal, if only because the agency is taking so long to complete its review. ''The delay is leading people to that conclusion,'' he said. ''If they weren't going to oppose it, why would they be taking so long to say so?''
Several published reports have cited unidentified people as saying the Justice Department is leaning toward blocking the proposed deal. But Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., strongly refuted that claim on Wednesday, insisting that it is too early for the agency to have made a decision.
"It is not credible that staff would have formed a recommendation at a time when we are working very closely with them to present the merits of our case, " said James Rill, a lawyer with Howrey, Simon, Arnold &amp; White, who is representing Oracle.
Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's antitrust division, declined to comment on the investigation, saying only that it was continuing.
Oracle also faces other roadblocks. If the merger were to go through, PeopleSoft's customer refund program could make Oracle liable for more than $1.5 billion in payments in the event that Oracle violates provisions in PeopleSoft contracts. Oracle executives, however, have continually called the issue of the refund program a moot point because the company plans to continue supporting PeopleSoft's products after the merger. Several state attorneys general have also expressed concern about the deal's effects on their states, though only Connecticut has filed a lawsuit. That suit is still pending.
Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, said Oracle's higher bid has no effect on his view of the deal, and shows only that Oracle is moving ahead. ''It proves Oracle continues to be serious with its illegal takeover,'' Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview Wednesday. ''We're determined to pursue our antitrust action and block Oracle's illegal actions that would decrease competition.''
