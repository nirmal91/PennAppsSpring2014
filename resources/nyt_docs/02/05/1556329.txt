What makes the new store called Manhattan Center for Kitchen and Bath different? ''Ten thousand square feet,'' said Mayer Preger, a partner. The ground floor has dream kitchens, like the one below with a stainless steel cabinet ($10,000), a round island ($25,000) and a Sub-Zero refrigerator ($5,442). But you can also find a $299 General Electric 30-inch four-burner gas range and a $382 Maytag refrigerator. The 250 appliances for sale include 27 cooktops. The bath section, to open March 1, will carry 35 shower heads. The store's interior designers will visit sites and make drawings for a $2,500 retainer, against the purchase price of appliances. The store is at 29 East 19th Street (Broadway); (212) 995-0500.
