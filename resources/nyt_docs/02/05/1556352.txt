To the Editor:
''Bronx Boy, 1, Drowns in Bucket in Leaky Kitchen'' (news article, Jan. 30) is heart-rending beyond words. The fact that a bucket was needed because of a severe leak is unacceptable.
Nonetheless, while this might not be considered the appropriate or politically correct time to make the following statement, I do so to save other toddlers' lives in the future. Parents, grandparents, babysitters: Never leave a young child unsupervised, even if you need to take the child into the bathroom with you. We all know that a few seconds can bring death.
Babies' lives are in our hands every waking moment. If one child's life is saved because of this article or because of this letter, thank goodness.
