A picture caption on Tuesday about a man selling snowballs in Times Square for $5 apiece identified him by a false name that he provided. His real name could not immediately be confirmed yesterday. (Michael Daly is the name of a columnist for The Daily News who wrote on Dec. 10 about a similar stunt by the same man, whom he identified as Gilberto Triplitt, an artist from Queens.)
