A construction company was accused yesterday of dumping the equivalent of hundreds of truckloads of illegal construction debris on a public golf course in White Plains, the county police commissioner, Thomas Belfiore, said. Riverkeeper, an environmental group, received a tip that demolition debris was being dumped at the Maplemoor Golf Course last fall, Mr. Belfiore said. County investigators discovered that a driver for Joseph Carducci Inc. had dumped about 70 cubic yards of illegal material for 14 months ending last October, Mr. Belfiore said. The driver, Adolfo Garufi, was charged with a misdemeanor. His employer, Joseph Carducci, denied that his driver had broken the law. Mr. Belfiore said that such material can be legally disposed of only in a solid-waste facility.
