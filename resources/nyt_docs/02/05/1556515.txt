An article in Business Day yesterday about the trial of Martha Stewart and the testimony of Douglas Faneuil, a former stockbroker's assistant, misspelled the given name of a member of the Waksal family who sought to sell shares of ImClone Systems the same day that Mr. Faneuil said he was ordered to tell Ms. Stewart about the family's plans. She is Elana Waksal Posner, not Ilana.
