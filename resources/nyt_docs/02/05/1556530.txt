A man accused of fatally shooting a homeless man was found guilty of murder on Tuesday. Prosecutors said that last September, the accused man, Vadim Traut, 54, of Queens, entered an area where homeless people were known to congregate, pulled a 12-gauge shotgun from his trench coat, and shot Kevin Monroe, 46. Prosecutors said that when three homeless men discovered Mr. Traut standing over Mr. Monroe, Mr. Traut ordered one of the men to help dispose of the body, but that he refused. Mr. Traut then struck him in the head with the gun, the prosecutors said, and the man ran away.
