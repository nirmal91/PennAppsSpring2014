Fumihiko Maki (inset), the Pritzker Prize architect, will give the keynote speech at ''Technology and Tradition in Contemporary Japanese Architecture,'' a three-day symposium beginning Feb. 26 at the Japan Society. The symposium will present recent work by many architects, including Terunobu Fujimori, designer of the Camellia Castle (left), a winery with a grass roof; and a tearoom (far left, bottom) with a ceiling made of hanging strips of bark. Also among the 24 architects, critics and curators is Shuhei Endo, whose model for a museum competition (far left, top) has roofs of curved sheet steel. Ken Tadashi Oshima, an architectural historian who will participate, noted that Japanese architects tend to have ''inventive or far-out solutions.''
The keynote address is sold out. Tickets for Friday afternoon, Feb. 27, are $55 ($20 for students); for events all day on Saturday, Feb. 28, $75 ($35 for students).
The Japan Society is at 333 East 47th Street; (212) 752-3015.
