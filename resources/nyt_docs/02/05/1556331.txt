To the Editor:
Re ''Speech by Gates Lends Visibility to E-Mail Stamp in War on Spam'' (Business Day, Feb. 2):
Spam was once known by another name: junk mail.
Long before we all had to hit the delete key a few extra times during the day, mailboxes around the country filled up with bulk mailings and special offers.
No one should be under the illusion that adding postage fees to e-mail will do a single thing to hinder would-be advertisers. Advertisers pay the post office to deliver their mail, and they'll pay Internet service providers to do the same.
E-mail postage is just another revenue stream for providers and software developers, and nothing more.
Not convinced? Step outside and check your mailbox. Congratulations! You've been pre-approved.
