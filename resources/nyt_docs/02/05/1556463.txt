Tel√©fonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest telecommunications company, reported that profit grew 10.3 percent in 2003, to $2 billion. Revenue, however, was flat for the year, at $10.6 billion, because the company kept rates for calls frozen despite inflation. The company said that it had spent almost $1 billion to increase its capacity and that it had about 15.7 million lines in service and two million subscribers to its Internet service.
