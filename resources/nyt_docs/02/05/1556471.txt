Rescuers searched frantically but without success for a 3-year-old boy who fell into an open sewer construction site in Johannesburg's Soweto township and was swept away in a rapid tide of storm water. The disappearance and later charges that playmates had accidentally pushed the toddler into a hole left uncovered by construction workers, has dominated South African headlines. Officials said there was no hope that the boy would be found alive.
