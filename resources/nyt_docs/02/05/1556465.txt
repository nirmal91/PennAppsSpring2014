British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network that is partly owned by the News Corporation, said that the chief financial officer, Martin Stewart, would leave in August to pursue other interests. Mr. Stewart was a candidate to be chief executive, but the job was filled in November by James R. Murdoch, the youngest son of Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corporation.
