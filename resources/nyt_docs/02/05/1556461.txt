ESPN Radio announced yesterday that it would carry Knicks and Rangers games for three years starting next season, replacing WFAN, their longtime home.
The deal is an unusual one, in which MSG Networks, which owns the rights to the Knicks' and the Rangers' games, will pay ESPN Radio nothing and keep all advertising revenue. WFAN receives an annual fee from MSG of several thousand dollars, but MSG has kept all the commercial time. ''Proceeding with a deal made no financial sense for us,'' said Lee Davis, WFAN's general manager.
WFAN will most likely pursue the radio rights to the Islanders, the Devils and the Nets, which expire after this season. Knicks and Rangers games are not nearly as highly rated as baseball is with men between the ages of 25 to 54, the key listener group in radio sports.
Mike McCarthy, the president of MSG Networks, said that ESPN was ''by far the preferable choice'' and would give the teams far more coverage than they received on WFAN. He said that ESPN would use some of the announcers from MSG's television network.
''We've been contemplating this and hearing of their interest for a long time,'' McCarthy said.
