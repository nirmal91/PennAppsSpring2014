The banking concern ABN Amro Holding reported a 43 percent rise in 2003 net income, to 3.16 billion euros ($3.92 billion). In the fourth quarter, ABN earned 857 million euros, a 25 percent increase over the year-earlier period. ABN attributed its improved performance to cost-cutting measures, fewer provisions for bad debt and rising stock markets. ABN's chairman, Rijkman Groenink, above, said bank consolidation in the United States was likely to mean that such concerns will want to expand retail banking operations in Europe, possibly through mergers. News that ABN Amro had dropped a takeover defense set off speculation that the company might entertain a merger offer, possibly from a bank in the United States.
