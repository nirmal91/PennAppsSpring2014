To the Editor:
I can't share your impatience for limiting the Democratic debates to two or three candidates (editorial, Feb. 4).
Breadth of debate is helping each candidate strengthen and tighten his message, and the voters are enjoying the show.
The rule of musical chairs -- removing just one chair every round -- leaves plenty of time for a vigorous debate between two finalists when we reach that stage, and it could make my vote count for something.
