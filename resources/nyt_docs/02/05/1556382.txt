Batteries do more than run portable electronic devices; they influence the form of the devices they power, because designers must make room for them in digital cameras, music players and other products.
A new line of batteries from Duracell is intended to help ever-shrinking digital devices become even smaller.
The new batteries look like smaller, flattened versions of 1.5-volt AA's and 3-volt D's.
''Device designs are growing smaller and smaller by the day," said Jim O'Donnell, the vice president for new products at Duracell.
The CP1 lithium prismatic battery is a rectangular disposable battery less than a quarter-inch thick that will cost $8 to $12 when it is released in early March. The LP1, an alkaline prismatic battery that resembles a thick stick of chewing gum, will cost $5 a pair when it reaches stores this summer or early fall.
The first products to use prismatic batteries include the Atrac CD Walkman Player from Sony, the iRiver SlimX 550 digital audio player and the Nikon Coolpix 3700 digital camera. One benefit of the batteries' flat profile: they won't roll away when you drop them.
