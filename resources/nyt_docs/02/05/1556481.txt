Two of the three state legislators who were on a list of companies and individuals behind in their taxes have resolved their delinquencies, the State Department of Revenue said. Representatives Lynmore James and Barbara J. Mobley repaid the agency and are off the list, which was reported on Monday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Senator Vincent D. Fort, who remains on the list, said he had been negotiating a payment plan.
