Delta Air Lines is scaling back plans for Song, its low-fare airline, as it conducts a complete review of its operational structure, company officials said yesterday.
In an interview, Song's president, John Selvaggio, insisted the year-old airline could play a key role as Delta battles other low-fare airlines, like Southwest and JetBlue, for passengers on the Eastern Seaboard and elsewhere in the country.
However, the airline is studying the future of Song under an extensive re-evaluation of its operations that was ordered by its new chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, who assumed his job on Jan. 1, Mr. Selvaggio said.
The airline is striving to cut costs and is pushing its pilots union to grant concessions so that it can keep pace with lower labor rates at other airlines like American and United.
Song, which cost Delta $65 million to develop, was started last April after much fanfare as an airline-within-an-airline, meant to appeal to passengers who have been defecting in droves from major carriers in search of cheaper tickets. Delta configured 36 Boeing 757 jets, with 199 seats each, to fly routes from New York to Florida and elsewhere.
However, Delta for now is not carrying through with a previously announced expansion of Song service that it had planned to put in place this year. Although Delta said last week that it would invest at Kennedy Airport to expand its service there, it announced only two new flights for Song. By contrast, soon after it announced the new carrier, Delta said it hoped Song eventually might replace Delta Express, its regional carrier flying to smaller cities.
Meanwhile, Delta plans to eliminate three Song flights from Washington Dulles Airport by April, Aviation Daily reported last night. Song only began flying from Dulles to Orlando in September. Aviation Daily said the Song planes instead will be used on Delta flights from New York to Fort Myers, Fla.
