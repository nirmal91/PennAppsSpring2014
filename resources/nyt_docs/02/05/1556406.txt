A day after tests on powder in an envelope at a postal center here addressed to the Republican National Committee did not find a problem, employees at the 500,000-square-foot center were skeptical and frustrated.
Since 2001, when hoaxes were rampant after the Sept. 11 attacks, the center has had at least 125 similar incidents, said John Dirzius, president of the American Postal Workers of Greater Connecticut.
For most of Tuesday, before the State Health Department confirmed that the powder was not ricin, the plant was in chaos, employees said. When employees arrived at 7 a.m., federal agents were combing the plant. The hand-sorting area was cordoned off, and television news crews taped outside. At 3:30, managers met employees in the cafeteria.
''Until then, everyone's information was piecemeal,'' said James Willard, who repairs mail sorting machines.
Debra Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the United States Postal Service, said the postal inspector could not release information immediately but must wait until it is verified.
