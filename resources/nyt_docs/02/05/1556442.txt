To the Editor:
Your Feb. 4 editorial ''Keep the Primaries Going'' casts a disturbing shadow on our political system and on its coverage by the news media in that there is no mention of a proposal or a viewpoint that may have influenced the voters.
Success or failure was based on appearances or other nonquantifiable data.
For example, about John Kerry: ''His selling point -- and it's a powerful one -- is that he seems like a winner.'' Just how does a winner seem?
John Edwards is ''heir to the old tradition of turn-of-the-century Southern populism.'' Maybe. But is that a valid criterion for one's vote?
The Rev. Al Sharpton did poorly compared with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's previous run for the presidency because he ''is not in that league.'' Or could it be that his views were less appealing?
Finally, Wesley K. Clark ''spent vast amounts of money on this round.'' That, at least, is verifiable, though not informative about his stand on the issues.
I hope that your election editorials will start evaluating factual proposals made by the candidates. This will help draw the voters' attention to issues on which their votes should be based.
