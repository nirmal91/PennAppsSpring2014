Rande Gerber, right, the owner of the Midnight Oil Company, unveiled his Stone Rose lounge, above, on the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center last night. It is the newest of his 20 bars and restaurants, many in W Hotels. The Stone Rose, by the Toronto architectural firm of Yabu Pushelberg, departs from Mr. Gerber's usual formula of overtly sexy clubs, although there are discreet nooks for liaisons innocent and otherwise.
''I wanted this to be sophisticated and elegant, as well as sexy,'' he said. As befits the name, polished stone and rosewood are used throughout. Chairs and couches are upholstered in velvet, calfskin or crocodile-embossed leather. Eighteen-foot ceilings and views of Central Park and Columbus Circle are a luxury in themselves. Over the bar is a painting by Greg Lauren, a nephew of Ralph Lauren and friend of Mr. Gerber. (Mr. Gerber even set up a temporary studio for Mr. Lauren on the third floor.) The food has a pedigree, too: It is by Jean-George Vongerichten. Stone Rose, 10 Columbus Circle; (212) 823-9770.
