No competitor was busier than Consandria Walker, a sophomore at Hackensack High School in New Jersey, at the Metropolitan Area High School Invitational last night.
Competing at the New Balance Track and Field Center at the Armory, Walker won the girls' 55-meter dash in 7.1 seconds, tying the meet record; she finished second in the triple and long jumps, and she ran a 200 leg on the 800-meter relay as Hackensack placed second (1 minute 47.4 seconds) to Mount Vernon (1:47.1).
Craig Forys, a freshman at Colts Neck High (N.J.), set a meet record in the boys' 1,600-meter run in 4:23.6. Meet marks in the girls competition went to Liz McCurdy of Bay Shore (N.Y.) in the 1,600 (4:59.8); Angelica Gregory of the Hackley School in Tarrytown (N.Y.) in the 800 (2:14.4); Tyana Peters of Mount Olive (N.J.) in the high jump (5 feet 6 inches); and Kirthan Firlas of Mount Vernon in the triple jump (36-11 1/4).
