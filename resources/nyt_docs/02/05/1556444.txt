To the Editor:
Re ''Keep the Primaries Going'' (editorial, Feb. 4):
There is always the possibility that Senator John Edwards will overcome the Kerry juggernaut.
So any suggestions about a John Kerry victory should be kept to a minimum. While his ''comeback'' has been impressive, the fat lady hasn't yet sung!
