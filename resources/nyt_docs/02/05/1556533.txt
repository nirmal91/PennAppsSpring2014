The Boston Red Sox will sign Ellis Burks today to a one-year contract with a chance to make $1 million, according to a person familiar with the talks. Burks passed his physical yesterday and will be the Red Sox' primary designated hitter against left-handed pitchers.
Burks, 39, started his career in Boston in 1987 and spent six years there. He had 32 homers and batted .301 for Cleveland in 2002, but he missed most of last season after needing surgery to repair a nerve condition in his right elbow. His agent, Jim Turner, said yesterday that Burks would be ready for spring training.
