The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 70,000 supermarket workers idled by a strike and lockout in Southern California, called for binding arbitration to settle a four-month dispute. But the companies involved, Safeway, Albertsons and Kroger, rejected the offer, saying they saw no need for an arbitrator when federal mediators were already involved. On Oct. 11, the union began a strike over health and wage concessions.
