In a move to resolve a confrontation between reformist supporters of President Mohammad Khatami's government and their hard-line opponents, Iran's supreme religious leader has ordered a review of the disqualifications of thousands of parliamentary candidates, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, agreed to the review in a meeting with President Khatami on Tuesday after rejecting calls that the parliamentary election, set for Feb. 20, be postponed, the spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, said.
''We hope that by tomorrow we can announce honestly to people that we will hold the elections under minimum, not ideal, conditions,'' Mr. Ramezanzadeh told reporters.
Mr. Ramezanzadeh's comments were the first in days to suggest that negotiations by senior religious officials might diffuse the recent political crisis.
The members of Parliament who have been striking in protest since last month met with President Khatami on Wednesday. They are expected to end their strike on Thursday.
