To the Editor:
Unlike most of my liberal friends, I agree with Guy Coq (Op-Ed, Jan. 30) about France's attempt to ban head scarves from classrooms. If Muslim women would begin to explore the meaning of hair and why women's hair, in particular, needs to be covered, they might begin to change their minds about head scarves and realize that there are many other ways to express modesty -- which is, after all, all that the Koran requires.
