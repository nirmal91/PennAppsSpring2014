The State Supreme Court rejected a move by Republicans to make the state use voting districts this year that were drawn by a judge for the 2002 elections. The districts drawn by the judge, Knox Jenkins, replaced those drawn by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, which Judge Jenkins had declared unconstitutional. Under the judge's map, Republicans gained seats in both state houses. The Legislature seeks federal approval of its newly revised map by next Monday, or the state's primary could be delayed beyond its current date, May 4.
