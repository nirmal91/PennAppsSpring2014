The two rear cars of a Long Island Rail Road train derailed at the Jamaica station in Queens yesterday, causing scattered delays for passengers during the evening rush. Delays of 20 minutes were expected for this morning. Railroad officials said that there were no injuries, and that the cause of the derailment remained unclear. The train, with only crew members on board, derailed at 4:10 p.m. as it was traveling west. Delays were 10 to 20 minutes during the height of the rush between 5 and 7 p.m., the railroad said.
