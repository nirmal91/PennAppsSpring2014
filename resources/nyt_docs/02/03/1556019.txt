The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the big winner in the Justice Department's $18.7 billion budget, as department officials emphasize the need for more investigators, better technology and more innovative programs to fight terrorism.
That push will come at the expense of traditional law enforcement programs like grants to local police departments.
The department budget includes an increase of $371 million for antiterrorism programs like a new center run by the Central Intelligence Agency to analyze terrorist intelligence and another center to coordinate watch lists.
The F.B.I. would receive an increase of 11.4 percent, which would take its budget to $5.1 billion. Among the big-ticket items are tens of millions of dollars to improve intelligence analysis, investigate terrorism and fight cybercrime. The budget would allow the bureau to add 159 field agents to investigate terrorism and 86 positions to help translate foreign intelligence. It would add $9 million to counterterrorism research on biochemical weapons.
In all, the budget would increase the number of agents working on counterterrorism, to 5,115 next year, from 4,590 now.
With overall budget authority at the Justice Department rising 2 percent, officials expect potentially major cuts in other areas, and that is likely to set off debate in Congress.
The F.B.I. plans, for instance, to eliminate all 95 positions in the section that investigates government fraud, reassigning those employees to counterterrorism and other ''higher priority items,'' the department said.
