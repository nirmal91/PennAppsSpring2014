To the Editor:
Guy Coq's history lesson (Op-Ed, Jan. 30) is interesting but irrelevant. When a high school student wears a cross, is it really an attempt by the Catholic Church ''to oppress minorities and make law''? If so, the scarf ban should not be limited to public schools.
The proposed law gives Christians fashion advice -- no ''large'' crosses -- while preventing Muslims, Jews and others from observing religious laws and centuries-old traditions. These minority children will no doubt leave public school, the very place where they might have learned ''how can one be French'' and religious at the same time.
