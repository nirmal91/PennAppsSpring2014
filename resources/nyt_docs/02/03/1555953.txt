To the Editor:
Re ''On Campaign Trail, Edwards Combines Personal and Political'' (front page, Feb. 2):
John Edwards would make a formidable opponent for President Bush. Senator Edwards has been in the Senate long enough to know its ins and outs, but unlike John Kerry and Joseph I. Lieberman, not long enough for the Bush campaign to dig up 15 or 20 years of voting record.
I for one would love to see a debate between Mr. Bush, who at best is inarticulate, and Mr. Edwards, a top trial lawyer.
