The Masterfoods USA division of Mars Inc. is consolidating the bulk of the media planning and buying for its candy, food and pet-food brands and awarding the assignment, with billings estimated at $300 million to $350 million, to the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe.
The MediaVest Worldwide unit of Starcom MediaVest in New York had been one of five agencies handling media assignments for Masterfoods. Hiring Starcom MediaVest ''allows us the opportunity to draw upon the diversified resources that the agency provides,'' Jeffrey Moran, a spokesman for Masterfoods said yesterday. Mr. Moran confirmed a report in AdAge.com, adding that the account would be led from MediaVest's offices in Los Angeles and New York.
The decision came after a three-month review that included MediaCom Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group; Mediaedge:cia, part of the GroupM division of the WPP Group; and OMD, part of the Omnicom Group. Starcom MediaVest will principally handle television planning and buying. MediaCom will continue handling buying for outdoor advertising and Mediaedge:cia will continue handling buying for print advertising, Mr. Moran said.
