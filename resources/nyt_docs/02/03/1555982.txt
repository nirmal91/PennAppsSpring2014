To the Editor:
Re ''Plan Aids Diabetic Heart Patients'' (Jan. 27): It is unfortunate that the treatment plan described in the article is not supported by a randomized study. The history of medicine is littered with examples of treatments that were enthusiastically embraced by a vanguard of physicians but later fell out of favor when not supported by a randomized clinical trial.
The results of a study in Belgium do support tight control of blood sugar levels in patients in the intensive care unit. With luck, a similar study can be done in cardiac surgery patients. Until then, the proposed plan will have only observational support.
