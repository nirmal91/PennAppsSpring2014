To the Editor:
The entire Super Bowl halftime show was a disgrace, not just Janet Jackson's part of the show (Sports pages, Feb. 2). CBS went too far in trying to hold our attention during halftime and to sell records of MTV stars. CBS and Viacom should be ashamed, and they cannot blame a faulty costume for the beginning of this tasteless show.
As a country, we are criticized by Muslim moderates and physically attacked by Islamic purists. They say our culture is morally corrupting. Did this show give them further confirmation?
Many in our country do not understand why people in the Middle East and other areas of the world hate us. We need to really consider who we are. Are we addicted to the pursuit of pleasure and wealth above all else? If we are, then we will reap what we sow.
