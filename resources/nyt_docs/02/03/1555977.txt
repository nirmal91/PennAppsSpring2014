To the Editor:
Re ''Has the Shuttle Become NASA's '76 Dart?'' (Jan. 27): There is one overwhelming reason not to spend billions of dollars on a flawed space shuttle. Expensive human space programs siphon money from unmanned science satellites, which provide the real data for sorting out alternative theories on the nature and origin of the universe.
This applies also to the scientifically sterile space station and to the proposed human missions to the Moon and Mars.
