Following are highlights of President Bush's $2.4 trillion budget for the 2005 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1:
OVERVIEW -- The budget features big increases for military and homeland security but cuts or holds down the growth in spending for most other programs. President Bush projected the deficit to be $521 billion in the 2004 fiscal year and $364 billion in the 2005 fiscal year. The 2005 deficit figure does not count the cost of the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
ENERGY -- The president proposes $24.3 billion in spending for the Energy Department. But the administration significantly scaled back energy tax breaks to $7.2 billion over 10 years compared with about $25 billion sought by Congress last year.
JUSTICE -- The Justice Department's $18.7 billion includes $2.6 billion for counterterrorism, an increase of 19 percent from last year. The F.B.I. is the main beneficiary, with a proposed budget of $5.1 billion dedicated to expanding counterterrorism investigations, improving intelligence analysis and other areas.
EDUCATION -- President Bush is proposing significant spending increases in two major areas. The budget would increase aid to poor districts by $1 billion, to $13.3 billion, which would go to schools that are the main beneficiaries of his No Child Left Behind program.
DOMESTIC SECURITY -- The proposed budget would increase spending for the Department of Homeland Security to $40.2 billion, a 10 percent increase above last year's $36.5 billion. It calls for $890 million to enhance aviation and transportation security and $411 million to strengthen border and port security.
HEALTH CARE -- The Bush administration is once again proposing new tax credits to help the uninsured buy health coverage, with a $70 billion plan over 10 years. It also plans a significant increase to the Food and Drug Administration to secure food safety.
NASA -- A 5.6 percent increase is proposed in NASA's budget, to $16.2 billion, a step in pursuing the president's vision for refocusing space exploration.
