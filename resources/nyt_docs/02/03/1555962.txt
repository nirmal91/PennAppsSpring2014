To the Editor:
Re ''Patriots Win 2nd Super Bowl in 3 Years'' (front page, Feb. 2):
One wonders what is going on when CBS rejects as inappropriate MoveOn.org's Super Bowl ad highlighting the huge deficits resulting from President Bush's fiscal policies and then broadcasts a halftime show featuring Nelly's crotch-grabbing and the baring of Janet Jackson's breast.
It seems clear that the country has lost its way.
