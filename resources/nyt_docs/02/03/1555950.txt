To the Editor:
David Brooks (''Electing the Electable,'' column, Jan. 31) did such a great job of reducing the Democratic nomination process to its essence that I thought I would return the favor.
President Bush remains the unchallenged, unquestioned standard-bearer for Republicans even though his administration has created record deficits in record time and lost millions of jobs. Even though America was attacked on his watch, but he hasn't captured the man who directed the attacks. Even though he and his administration presented what has been shown to be false intelligence to the United Nations, Congress and the American people to justify invading Iraq, severely miscalculated the human and financial costs of an occupation, and lost the good will of most of the world's countries. Even though he has demolished any remaining bipartisanship in Washington and has never taken an iota of responsibility for any of the above.
Clearly, among Republicans, it's the electability, stupid.
