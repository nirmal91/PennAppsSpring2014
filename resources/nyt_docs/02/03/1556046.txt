Two German women were being examined for possible bird flu at a tropical diseases clinic in Hamburg, though a city health official said it was unlikely that either of them actually had the disease. The women, both of whom recently returned from vacations in Thailand, were expected to stay for the night at the Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine. If the tests on them are positive, they will represent the first reported European cases of bird flu, a disease that has killed 12 people in several countries in Asia. The Hamburg clinic did not comment on the cases.
