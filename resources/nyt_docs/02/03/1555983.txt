To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''The Widening of America, or How Size 4 Became a Size 0'' (Jan. 20): I once weighed 290 pounds but shed almost a third of my weight simply by exercising and eating a well-balanced diet. Many other obese Americans, however, are unwilling to face a similar reality.
The variety of diet drugs and gimmicks on the market is bewildering, and Americans are spending billions of dollars a year on them. Yet they just don't seem to be working.
It should be obvious by now that the weight-loss establishment is leading us in the wrong direction and has done so for decades. In the process, it has made tons of money and cost millions of people their lives and spirit.
