The Yukos Oil company took another step to distance management of the oil company from its principal shareholders in an effort to fend off continued political attacks. The company's directors ousted Mikhail B. Brudno, left, acting president of the company's refining and marketing division, citing corporate governance standards. Mr. Brudno was recently put on a wanted list by Russia's prosecutor general's office. Mr. Brudno was the last large Yukos shareholder still actively helping to run the oil business. He owns 7 percent of a holding company that houses the financial empire of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former Yukos chief executive who stepped down after his arrest Oct. 25. Mr. Khodorkovsky is in prison awaiting trial on charges of tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. Mr. Brudno will be succeeded by Peter S. Zolotarev, previously first vice president for economics and finance at the refining division.
