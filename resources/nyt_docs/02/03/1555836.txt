Sensations that felt painful to people with healthy skin felt like an itch to patients with skin disorders, according to a study released yesterday.
The study's lead researcher, Dr. Martin Schmelz of the University of Heidelberg, said the findings helped explain why scratching relieved itch in some people while making it worse for others.
The study, which was published in the journal Neurology, involved a phenomenon called central sensitization, which Dr. Schmelz said had been examined mostly in terms of pain.
Dr. Schmelz called the response ''a kind of learning process which makes the central nervous system more sensitive'' to a stimulus that is repeated. When the body reports pain more and more often, less and less pain stimulus is needed to set off a pain signal from the spinal cord to the brain.
In the new study, researchers subjected the skin of 20 healthy people and 25 patients with atopic dermatitis to pinpricks, shocks and heat.
The people with healthy skin reported feeling pain, but those with the chronic skin inflammation of the dermatitis reported feeling itch, especially when the stimulus touched the sores on the skin or was close to them.
Dr. Smeltz noted that scratching was a normal response to itch, because mild pain sensations could override the itching nerve impulses. But once the central nervous system becomes overattuned to itch, the impulse backfires, he said.
''In the sensitized patients,'' he added, ''the scratching will not suppress the itch but instead it will directly induce itch and further scratching.''
The study also suggests that researchers should pursue drugs that suppress the misreading of itch by the central nervous system instead of just reducing skin irritation, he said.
