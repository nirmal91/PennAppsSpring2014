Twin boys are more likely to be born prematurely than twin girls or a mixed-sex pair, a study published yesterday reported.
According to the article, published in the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, preterm births have been increasing in many countries, and are more common in general among baby boys.
The researchers, led by Dr. Shi Wu Wen of the University of Ottawa, examined records from the delivery of almost 150,000 pairs of twins born in the United States from 1995 to 1997. They found that 40.2 percent of twin boys were born at less than 36 weeks, compared with 37.8 percent of girls and 36.8 percent for mixed pairs. The difference in risk was even higher for boy-boy pairs prior to 28 weeks.
One simple explanation for the disparity could be that boys tend to weigh more, but the study found that the mixed-sex pairs actually had the greatest combined weight. This led the researchers to speculate that differences in the sex hormones that set off labor could play a more important role.
Dr. Eileen Wang, an expert in maternal health at Northwestern University, who had no connection with the study, called the findings interesting. But because all twins are at greater risk for premature delivery, she said, physicians should be equally vigilant for all twins, whatever their sex.
