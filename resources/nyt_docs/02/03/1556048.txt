Four African migrants remained hospitalized one day after their boat, packed with 153 people, was seized off the Canary Islands, the National Police said. The migrants, one of whom is a woman who is two months pregnant, were seriously dehydrated from their 1,250-mile crossing, which had departed from Cape Verde. The police have arrested the captain and crew, and they will deport the passengers. The recent detention brings the total to more than 650 migrants intercepted while trying to reach Spain by boat this year.
