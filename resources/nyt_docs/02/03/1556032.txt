The State Supreme Court has asked the Legislature to draw up guidelines for determining when mentally ill convicts should be considered competent to be executed. State and federal law forbid execution when illness prevents the inmate from understanding his sentence. The court said it would review the sentence of Scott J. Bourque, convicted in two killings, whose lawyers contend he has schizophrenia. It said it would make its own guidelines if lawmakers did not act in the coming legislative session.
