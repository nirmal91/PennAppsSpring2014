The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
The Bush administration has repeatedly emphasized the importance of ''sound science'' in developing environmental regulations, but this year's federal budget makes significant cuts in research at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Most notably, the agency has cut its competitive grants program by about a third from the $100 million level it has maintained for the past several years. The program, which pays for studies by scientists outside the agency, has traditionally accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of the research budget in the agency's office of research and development.
Over all, the administration's budget for science and technology at the agency is $689 million, 12 percent less than the $782 million authorized in 2004. The total request for the agency is $7.8 billion, 7.2 percent less than last year's budget of $8.3 billion.
On a conference call yesterday, Steve Johnson, the acting deputy E.P.A. administrator, said the competitive-grants program, known as Science to Achieve Results or STAR, was cut back because it did not do well in its review by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
Paul Gilman, the agency's associate administrator for research and development, defended the grants program, noting that last year the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, reviewed it positively. The review concluded that ''the program has established and maintains a high degree of scientific excellence'' and that ''it should continue to be an important part of E.P.A.'s research program.''
Dr. Gilman said STAR was pushed aside by other agency initiatives, like a $65 million plan to reduce diesel emissions from school buses. ''You have to set your priorities,'' he said. ''Where do you make cuts for things like clean school buses and things like that?''
