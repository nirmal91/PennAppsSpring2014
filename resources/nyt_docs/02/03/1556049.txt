Gunmen wounded three people in an attempted assassination of Leonidas Iza, the leader of Ecuador's powerful National Indian Federation, indigenous leaders said. Mr. Iza was not injured in the attack late Sunday outside the federation's headquarters, but at least three relatives, including his son, were wounded, said Patricia Gualinga, an indigenous leader. The attack was cast by the federation as an effort to quiet an increasingly influential indigenous group that opposes the government's free-market reforms. President Lucio Guti√©rrez, who split with Indian allies last year, said the government would investigate.
