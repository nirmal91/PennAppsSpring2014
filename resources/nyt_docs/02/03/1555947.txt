To the Editor:
''Come Back, Little Deaniacs'' (editorial, Feb. 1) describes the dedicated political passion and hope that Howard Dean inspires in young people. But not only young people are recipients of this inspiration.
I traveled five hours to spend the weekend before the New Hampshire primary campaigning for Dr. Dean. I am 46 years old. The people I traveled with were 79, 69, 63, 47 and 45 years old.
I have never involved myself like this in politics before. I have never seen a candidate who has filled me with hope like this before. It is a great feeling.
