To the Editor:
Re ''Often, Time Beats Therapy'': The column discredits bereavement groups, but as someone who has suffered a terrible loss, I disagree.
My son and his wife died in an accident 10 years ago. Since then I have started my own support group called Healing and Nurturing Distraught Survivors, or Hands, which has helped many parents cope with their grief.
The pain of losing a child or loved one can be so overwhelming at times that it helps just to talk or be with people who understand.
