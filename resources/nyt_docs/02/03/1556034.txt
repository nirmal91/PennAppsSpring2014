The selection of the jury for the trial of Jayson Williams neared completion yesterday, with eight more potential jurors selected. They join a pool of 53 chosen since selection started on Jan. 13. Mr. Williams, left, the former New Jersey Nets star, is accused of aggravated manslaughter in the death of a limousine driver. A final day of additions to the jury pool is set for today. A panel of 12 jurors and 4 alternates is to be chosen from the pool early next week, after the presiding judge, Edward M. Coleman, rules on pretrial motions. Opening arguments are also expected next week. Mr. Williams, 35, is accused of fatally shooting the driver, Costas Christofi, 55, in February 2002 and trying to convince the police that the death was a suicide.
