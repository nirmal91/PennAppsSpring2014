To the Editor:
Re ''Come Back, Little Deaniacs'' (editorial, Feb. 1):
It is insulting and patronizing to assume that Howard Dean's supporters are all little kids who've lost their way and don't know how to vote and act like adults.
I'll tell you what turns people off to politics, and it's not fine, strong, intelligent men like Howard Dean. It's people in the news media who insult, belittle and discourage at every opportunity.
We in the Dean movement are not babies, and we're not going away. No matter what happens, we will keep fighting to take the country back from special interests and replace the veneer of what is passed off as ''news'' with the substance that Americans crave.
