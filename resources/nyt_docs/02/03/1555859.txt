To the Editor:
Re ''Time for Exxon to Pay'' (editorial, Jan. 30):
ExxonMobil deeply regrets the Valdez accident.
The purpose of punitive damages is punishment and deterrence. ExxonMobil has been punished, worked to prevent future accidents and made whole those directly affected by the spill.
ExxonMobil immediately paid more than $300 million to 11,000 affected people and businesses. An Alaska jury actually set those damages at $287 million, and the trial court noted: ''Exxon stepped forward with its people and its pocketbook and did what had to be done.''
ExxonMobil paid a $25 million fine (at that time the largest environmental fine ever paid), carried out the $2.2 billion cleanup until Alaska and the Coast Guard declared the cleanup complete, and also paid $1 billion for restoration programs.
We have led the industry in improving tanker safety, navigational technology and emergency response.
These aren't actions warranting additional punishment. Judge Russel Holland's excessive punitive damage awards have twice been overturned.
