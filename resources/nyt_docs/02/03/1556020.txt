The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
President Bush's new vision for the space program, which looks to send astronauts to the Moon and, eventually, Mars, begins with a proposed 5.6 percent increase in National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget for the 2005 fiscal year to $16.2 billion.
But most of the $12 billion the administration wants to spend on this goal over the next five years would come from redirecting $11 billion from other NASA programs.
Under the Bush plan, money for the exploration initiative would come from ending space shuttle operations by 2010 and ending use of the International Space Station in 2016.
The $800 million increase that NASA would receive over its current $15.4 billion would include $300 million for extra expenses in returning the space shuttle fleet to flight after the Columbia disaster last year; other new money would go toward developing alternatives to the shuttles.
The 2005 figures call for a modest increase in NASA's space science budget, to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion, while spending on earth science would drop to $1.48 billion from $1.52 billion.
