To the Editor:
Re ''Missteps Pulled a Surging Dean Back to Earth'' (front page, Feb. 1):
Senator John Kerry is needed to go toe to toe with President Bush on national security issues, goes the conventional wisdom that now bashes Howard Dean. Yet how is either Mr. Bush or Mr. Kerry considered strong in this area?
Mr. Kerry authorized an unnecessary, reckless, deadly war with Iraq, and Mr. Bush carried out that war, a war that has so far killed 520 and wounded more than 2,000 Americans. How have their actions made the country more secure?
If these two are perceived as strong, it is time to shift the paradigm of what makes one ''strong'' on national security. The new paradigm should include, at a minimum, competence and the actual use of force only as a last resort, not merely the declaration of such a doctrine of restraint.
