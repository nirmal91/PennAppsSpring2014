To the Editor:
''Electing the Electable,'' David Brooks's entertaining Jan. 31 column, may be right on target. But it's also possible that the people who voted for John Kerry were planning to do so all along, and the polls were simply following the pundits who were busy fulfilling their own prophecies.
Polls can be wrong. So can pundits. Ask President Dewey.
