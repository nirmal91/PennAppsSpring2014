Two securities firms, Securicor and Group 4 Falck, say they are in discussions about a merger that would create a company with a market capitalization of $3.1 billion. Britain's Securicor specializes in cash handling, while Group 4 Falck, based in Copenhagen, provides guards and alarms to corporate and institutional customers. If the deal goes through, shareholders for the two would be given stock in the new combined company, but no premium to the stock's current price.
