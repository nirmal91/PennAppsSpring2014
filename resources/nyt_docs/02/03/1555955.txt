To the Editor:
Re ''Scarves and Symbols,'' by Guy Coq (Op-Ed, Jan. 30):
The idea that religious symbols in a classroom cause tension and pose a threat to the foundations of civil peace is astonishing. In more than 20 years teaching in New York City, I've had students wearing turbans, yarmulkes, head scarves, prayer beads, crosses, pagan tattoos -- often all in the same classroom! And this has never interfered with learning. It has always enhanced it.
A ban by the French on such symbols would reflect their own deep-seated fear of diversity and their inability to create a public sphere where people who truly are different, and look it, are able to work together.
Mr. Coq cites American ''excess of individualism'' as an excuse for ancient French intolerance. I'm as secular as they come, but when I see bigotry masquerading as freedom, I thank God I'm an American.
