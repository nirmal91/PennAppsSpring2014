A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend on Friday about religious films that have stirred contention included an erroneous reference to the Immaculate Conception in connection with Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film ''Hail Mary,'' and a correction in this space on Saturday misattributed the belief involved. It is Roman Catholic teaching -- not the teaching of all Christian denominations -- that Mary was conceived by her mother, Anne, without the stain of original sin. And the term does not refer to the conception of Jesus by Mary.
