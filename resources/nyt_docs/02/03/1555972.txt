India's biggest government-owned refiner, the Indian Oil Corporation, will bid to acquire stakes in BP's retail businesses in Malaysia and Singapore, Indian Oil's chairman, M.S. Ramachandran, said. BP, Europe's largest oil company, announced last month that it was leaving the retail business in Malaysia and Singapore. Indian Oil will bid for BP's 70 percent stake in the Malaysian unit, which owns nearly 300 retail outlets, and its Singapore unit, which owns 30 outlets.
