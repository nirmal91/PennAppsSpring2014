To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''Often, Time Beats Therapy for Treating Grief'' (Jan. 27): We should not write off the value of psychotherapy for the bereaved, particularly the elderly.
Older people often lack the social support to help them cope with the loss of a spouse. In many cases, they are marginalized or have families that are too busy to help them cope with their grief.
But by listening and restoring some semblance of normalcy to their lives, recovery can occur. In the absence of that help, unresolved grief can lead to severe depression and a host of related health problems.
