Britain started a second investigation in the house fire that killed 14 black children in 1981 in the New Cross neighborhood of South London and helped set off race riots in Brixton that left about 400 people injured. The original inquest left open the cause of the fire, and families of the deceased have since been urging the government to re-examine the case. Many of the families felt the fire was started deliberately, and some communities said at the time of the first inquest's results that the mostly white police force had orchestrated a cover-up.
