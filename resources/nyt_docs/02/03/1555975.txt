German beer production fell 2.1 percent to 105.5 million hectolitres (2.78 billion gallons) from the previous year, the federal statistics office said. It was the eighth decline since 1994, when breweries produced 115.7 million hectolitres (3.05 billion gallons) a year. Domestic beer sales dropped 3.4 percent, to 93.2 million hectolitres (2.46 billion gallons), but beer exports rose 9.1 percent, to 12.3 million hectolitres (325 million gallons). Beer consumption in Germany has declined because of a growing health awareness, a sluggish economy and an unpopular new deposit system for cans and bottles.
