Even though boys are more likely than girls to have developmental disabilities involving language, doctors appear more likely to refer girls for further evaluation than boys, a new study shows.
The study's lead researcher, Dr. Laura Sices of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said the results showed that ''the myth is still out there that being male can be an adequate explanation for a speech delay.''
In the study, published on Sunday in the journal Pediatrics, Dr. Sices noted that while pediatricians and family physicians had increased their screenings for developmental problems, many early warning signs were still missed.
She cited figures showing that fewer than half of the young children considered eligible for special services were identified before kindergarten.
To help uncover what factors contributed to the missed opportunities for early diagnosis, Dr. Sices sent a survey to a random sample of the nation's pediatricians and family physicians. The survey, completed by 427 physicians, outlined a series of hypothetical vignettes and asked what action would be taken in each case.
When a hypothetical situation involved an 18-month-old who was failing to meet developmental milestones for speech, doctors were 60 percent more likely to refer a girl for further testing than a boy.
''There's a kind of a sense when you see that in a boy that he'll catch up, that he's just a late talker,'' Dr. Sices said. In fact, she added, the opposite is true. Disorders involving serious speech problems are twice as likely to be diagnosed in boys as girls, Dr. Sices said.
''Both boys and girls benefit greatly from early detection of language delays,'' she said.
