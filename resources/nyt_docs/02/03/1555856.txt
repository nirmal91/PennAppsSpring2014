Last year, a few days after Super Bowl Sunday, children in eight preschools in upstate New York began a series of lessons to encourage them and their families to spend less time watching television.
After five months, the children had reduced their viewing time by three hours a week, while a group of similar preschoolers who had not received the lessons increased theirs by more than an hour, according to a study published yesterday in The Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine.
Once a week for six weeks, the children in the program received lessons that promoted reading and activities like making place mats for family meals as alternatives to television. Materials sent home encouraged parents to do things like using stickers to reward children for reading.
The program ended in mid-March, when families were asked to do without television for a week. Then in April, a ''booster'' lesson was repeated before National TV-Turnoff Week, promoted by an advocacy group in Washington.
In June, tallies taken by parents found that television viewing by the children who received the lessons had fallen to 8.8 hours a week from 11.9 hours, while the children in the control group had gone to 15.6 hours from 14.
The study's lead researcher, Dr. Barbara A. Dennison of the Bassett Healthcare Research Institute in Cooperstown, N.Y., said that parents should not regard television as an impossible habit to break.
Developing a plan is important, she said, but ''children are surprisingly open to alternatives.'' Just turning off the television during dinner can make a difference, she said. A list of the program's steps is on the Web at www.bassett.org/pediatricsresearch.cfm.
