To the Editor:
Re ''Has the Shuttle Become NASA's '76 Dart?'': Space travel will advance only when we develop real propulsion systems. NASA is being held back by its use of chemical rockets, which are merely a trivial extension of the gunpowder rockets developed in China centuries ago.
To create more sophisticated technology like nuclear propulsion, we need another Manhattan Project that will provide long-term employment and economic rewards.
Sadly, President Bush's latest proposal has failure built into it and will become such an expensive fiasco that it may ultimately kill America's support for space travel.
