A woman who became known as the ''Blond Bandit'' for the wig she wore during a robbery spree at six banks in two days last spring was sentenced in federal court yesterday. Judge Ellen Bree Burns sentenced the defendant, Pamela A. Kaichen, 44, of Bedford Hills, N.Y., to 48 months on each of the six robbery counts, the sentences to be served concurrently, and ordered her to undergo a mental health treatment program. Ms. Kaichen stole $42,000 from banks in New York and Connecticut. She was arrested after a police officer who earlier had issued her a ticket for failing to wear her seatbelt recognized her from a bank surveillance photograph.
