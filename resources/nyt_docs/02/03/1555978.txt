Companhia Vale do Rio Doce SA, the world's biggest iron ore producer, said it was joining forces with China's Baosteel Group and the European steel giant Arcelor to build a steel plant in northern Brazil with an annual production capacity of 3.7 million metric tons of steel plate. According to a statement from CVRD, two engineering service companies, CISDI Engineering Company of China and Germany's Ferrostaal, had been contracted to present a feasibility study for the plant, to be built in Sao Luis. Should the venture prove successful, the statement said annual capacity could be doubled to 7.5 million metric tons a year.
