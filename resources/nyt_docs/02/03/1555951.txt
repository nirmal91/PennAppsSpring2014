To the Editor:
Re ''Electing the Electable,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 31):
Aside from the catty remarks about John Kerry's appearance, the only information I can gather from the column is that the Democratic Party is in the middle of the normal, healthy process of consolidating and refining its message during this presidential primary season by listening to the concerns of its constituency. Is there a problem with this?
