There is more than one way to turn an antisocial particle into one that hangs out with the crowd.
At temperatures just above absolute zero, matter can behave in many bizarre ways. Scientists at the University of Colorado and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have added another. Their findings, in the Jan. 24 issue of Physical Review Letters, may have important practical applications, including helping scientists decipher high-temperature superconductivity.
The particles of the universe all fall in one of two classes, bosons and fermions. At low enough temperatures, a clump of bosons can coalesce into a single ''quantum state'' and act as a single particle, in what is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. A fermion like an electron or a proton is fiercely antisocial and never wants to do exactly what another fermion is doing.
In November, two teams of physicists coaxed fermionic atoms to pair up through electrical attraction into bosonic molecules that could turn into Bose-Einstein condensate. Now, one team, led by Dr. Deborah S. Jin, has found that bouncing fermions against one another can also produce a small attractive force that again leads them to pair up. Paired up, the gas can again drop in a single quantum state.
That is somewhat similar to the way pairs of electrons in superconductors are able to carry current with virtually no resistance.
''Nobody knows quite what to call it,'' Dr. Jin said, so the physicists called it a fermionic condensate.
