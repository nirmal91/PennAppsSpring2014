Three former Immigration and Naturalization Service officers were fined and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 33 to 78 months for failing to obtain medical care for an illegal immigrant who died of injuries received during a raid they helped conduct in 2001. The officers -- Richard H. Gonzales and Louis R. Gomez, both 37, and Carlos Reyna, 43 -- were convicted in June in Federal District Court at San Antonio. The immigrant, Serafin Olvera-Carrera, received medical attention seven hours after the raid. He was paralyzed after suffering a broken neck and died 11 months later. Mr. Olvera-Carrera's family received $2.2 million in a settlement with the federal government.
