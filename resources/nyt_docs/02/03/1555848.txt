To the Editor:
Re ''Court to Review Using Execution in Juvenile Cases'' (front page, Jan. 27):
You report that four Supreme Court justices ''have made clear their opposition to the death penalty for 16-  and 17-year-olds, calling it 'inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society.' ''
Some people believe that murder, whether by a 17-year-old or a 71-year-old, is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society.
The age of the murderer should not be an impediment to the punishment.
