To the Editor:
Re ''Budget Office Forecasts Record Deficit in '04 and Sketches a Pessimistic Future'' (news article, Jan. 27): In the face of predictions of multi-trillion-dollar additional deficits, it might seem perplexing that President Bush still insists that his enormous tax cuts be made permanent rather than be allowed to expire. But I believe that there is a simple explanation for his refusal to modify his policies.
The calculation here is that accusing Democrats of wanting to ''raise'' taxes will be an effective issue in the president's re-election campaign. Let some future administration deal with the fiscal train wreck that's been set in motion.
