The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
The Bush administration's budget for energy programs offers almost $7.2 billion in tax breaks over 10 years to promote energy production and conservation, far less than the $25 billion sought by Congress in the energy legislation now stalled on Capitol Hill.
In apparent recognition that the broad bill might not succeed, the budget also emphasizes money for individual energy projects favored by the administration, including $228 million in 2005 for research into a hydrogen fuel cell, an increase of 42 percent over 2004.
There is also $275 million for work on a coal-burning power plant that would capture its emissions of carbon dioxide, a global warming gas, for long-term storage, as well as its other pollutants.
The spending plan assumes the administration will win approval to begin oil and gas production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, estimating royalty payments of $2.4 billion in 2006 with about half that amount to be spent on alternative energy programs. But the Senate has repeatedly blocked opening the refuge to drilling, a position it does not seem likely to change this year.
While proposals to upgrade the nation's power grid remain bogged down in the energy measure, the administration proposes to spend $91 million on efforts to modernize the power transmission infrastructure.
The budget calls for spending $7.4 billion to clean up sites contaminated with radioactivity from nuclear weapons production and research and provides a $303 million increase, to $880 million, to continue development of a nuclear waste depository in Nevada.
