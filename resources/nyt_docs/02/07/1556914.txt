The Michelin Red Guide added three restaurants to the much-coveted three-star category: L'Espérance and La Côte Saint Jacques, both in Burgundy, and Les Loges de L'Aubergade in the southwest join 24 other restaurants on the list. One specialty of Les Loges is a foie gras hamburger with a cèpe mushroom-based catsup called ''Ketcèpes,'' a name Michel Trama, its chef, has trademarked. The suicide last year of Bernard Loiseau, chef of the three-starred La Côte d'Or, drew attention to the high-pressure struggle to achieve and retain top ratings.
