The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper and a sharp critic of President Robert G. Mugabe, failed to appear on the streets after the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that it could not legally publish without a government license. The ruling effectively ended efforts by the paper and the Independent Journalists Association to overturn a 2002 law tightening government control over the news media.
