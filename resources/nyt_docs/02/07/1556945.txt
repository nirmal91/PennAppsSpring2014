To the Editor:
Re ''How to Hack an Election'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Jan. 31):
Have you ever agreed to arrive at a decision by the toss of a coin?
How would it be if the person doing the tossing also does the catching, slaps it on the back of his hand, and then proclaims that chance has favored him, without giving you the opportunity of seeing the proof?
''Electronic voting'' without a paper trail is the same thing.
