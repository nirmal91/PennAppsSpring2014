Canada's unemployment rate stood at 7.4 percent in January, unchanged from the previous month, Statistics Canada reported. The number of jobs created during the month slowed markedly from late 2003, with a rise in full-time jobs offset by shrinking part-time opportunities. Employment in health care and social assistance showed the biggest increase last month, continuing a two-year trend, but employment in manufacturing continued to shrink.
