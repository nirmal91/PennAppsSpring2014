Senate officials said on Friday that they expected all their office buildings to open on Monday, returning Congress to regular operations a week after a deadly poison was found in a mailroom serving the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist.
Searches for a tainted envelope in Dr. Frist's office have been fruitless, leading some investigators to theorize the envelope or package with the poison ricin may have been discarded days before the poison was found on a letter-opening machine.
Law enforcement officials said they had no suspects and did not know how the ricin had arrived.
With few leads, investigators expanded their search to Dr. Frist's offices in Tennessee. They reinterviewed some trucking organizations, because of ricin-tainted letters found last fall, including one intercepted en route to the White House, that threatened to contaminate water supplies unless the government rescinded a rule limiting truckers' hours .
Tests confirming the presence of ricin in Dr. Frist's suite in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Monday resulted in all three Senate office buildings being closed while investigators searched for a source. The Russell and Hart office buildings reopened on Thursday, with the Dirksen set to reopen on Monday.
No ricin has been detected outside where the substance was found.
