Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told Congress on Friday that ''at least three'' classified documents were improperly released to former Secretary Paul H. O'Neill after he was dismissed in December 2002.
In response to Congressional concerns that the department had grown lax in controlling sensitive material, Mr. Snow said steps have been taken to prevent inadvertent release of such material in the future. Ron Suskind, the author of a new book about Mr. O'Neill's experiences as treasury secretary, said the book was based on interviews with Mr. O'Neill and more than 19,000 documents, none of them classified, that he took with him when he left the job.
''O'Neill was out of this process,'' Mr. Suskind said. ''He was given two discs by the government, and he sumarily handed them to me. Nothing on the discs indicated that any material was stamped as classified. Some was sensitive, but nothing was stamped classified.''
But the assertion that Mr. O'Neill left with so much material led to a request of the department to determine if the assertion were true.
In a letter to Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Snow said that as a first step toward preventing future unauthorized disclosures, ''the Treasury Department is beginning to provide additional security training, including specific segments on the origination and handling of classified documents, for employees who work with such documents.''
