The ideal candidate will be unfazed by nine-digit fund-raising, equally comfortable in Albany and on Albany Street, familiar worldwide (but not enough to breed contempt), free for at least five years and able to shuttle between concrete reality and a more spiritual realm.
One other thing. ''The pay is nil,'' said Ira M. Millstein, a member of the search committee appointed yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to find a leader for the World Trade Center Site Memorial Foundation.
The foundation will raise money to build the memorial and will coordinate the development of an interpretive museum and a cultural center on the 6.5-acre memorial parcel at the southwest corner of the site.
Preliminary estimates suggest that it will cost $175 million to build the memorial, designed by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, and another $175 million to build the infrastructure below ground that will serve the entire 16-acre trade center complex.
In coming months, the foundation will assume much of the oversight role now played by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
First, it needs a chairwoman or chairman. The committee hopes to name its candidate in three weeks, said Mr. Millstein, the counsel to the development corporation board.
The job description includes strong ties to philanthropy and politics, and a sensitivity to the grief of relatives of those who died.
