Jill Kornblee, an art dealer whose Manhattan gallery handled the work of many well-known contemporary artists early in their careers, died on Jan. 29 in Branford, Conn. She was 84 and lived in Weston, Conn.
The cause was cancer, said her daughter Elisabeth Kornblee.
Born in New York City in 1920, Ms. Kornblee studied at Bryn Mawr College and later took art history courses at New York University's Institute of Fine Art. In 1961, with two partners, she bought the Barone Gallery on Madison Avenue near 79th Street. She soon took over her partners' interests and began operating the gallery under her own name.
An energetic dealer, receptive to new talent, Ms. Kornblee gave shows in the 1960's and 70's to a number of artists whose work is now well known. Among them were the British painter Howard Hodgkin, whose first solo exhibition in this country sold out at the gallery in 1973. Others included Dan Flavin, Malcolm Morley, Rackstraw Downes, Al Hansen, Janet Fish, Richard Smith, Peter Phillips, Mon Levinson and Michael Mazur.
She also had close friendships with other dealers, among them Leo Castelli, Ivan Karp, Allan Stone, John Bernard Myers and Betty Parsons. The Kornblee Gallery mounted several shows of work by Ms. Parsons, who was also an artist.
In the mid-1960's Ms. Kornblee moved the gallery to 58 East 79th Street, and in the late 70's to 20 West 57th Street, where it remained until she retired in 1986.
In addition to her daughter Elisabeth, who lives in Boston, Ms. Kornblee is survived by her husband, Dr. Leonard V. Kornblee of Weston; another daughter, Mary K. Gabriel, also of Boston; a son, John C. Kornblee of Rocky Hill, Conn.; and three grandchildren.
