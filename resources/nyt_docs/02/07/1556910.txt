President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam dissolved the lower house of Parliament, preparing the way for early elections this spring. In a speech, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who will lead the campaign for his governing Bharatiya Janata Party, suggested it would be a hard-hitting one. He pronounced the Congress Party, which is led by Sonia Gandhi, widow of the assassinated prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, not ''fit to rule.'' The dates for the election, which will probably be held in April, will be set by India's independent Election Commission.
