China broke up one of Taiwan's most successful military espionage networks, a Taiwan newspaper reported. The spy ring was centered on China's Nanjing Military Region, which has naval troops and missile batteries that would be used in any conflict with Taiwan, and was the highest-level espionage operation disrupted by China since 1998, the United Daily News of Taiwan quoted Taiwanese military officials as saying. Among those arrested was the head of the network, Col. Li Yun-pu of Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau, and several mainland agents he recruited.
