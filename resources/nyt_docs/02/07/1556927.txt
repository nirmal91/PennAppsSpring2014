The United Methodist Church has set a trial for March 17 for the Rev. Karen Dammann, a pastor in Ellensburg, Wash., who in 2001 notified her bishop that she was living in a lesbian relationship. The church prohibits ''self-avowed practicing homosexuals'' from being in the clergy. Thirteen other clergy members will serve as judges in the case. Ms. Dammann could face removal from the ministry.
