To the Editor:
Re ''The Administration's Scramble'' (editorial, Feb. 6): I suggest going further and asking, Where does the buck stop? If President Bush wishes to play convincingly his favorite role of commander in chief, he ought to accept the buck of responsibility for the failure, be it intelligence's or that of his decision-making process.
