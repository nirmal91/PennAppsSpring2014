To the Editor:
Re ''The Administration's Scramble'' (editorial, Feb. 6):
The Bush administration's attempts to justify this war are becoming increasingly Orwellian.
You cannot start a war and then later change your reason for doing so if you hope to retain any shred of credibility. Where is Mr. Bush's celebrated moral rectitude and clarity? If he did not lie, why can he not stand up and admit he made a mistake?
This is not merely a matter of principle. Thousands of children, women and men have been killed and maimed at the orders of men who have no experiences with these horrors.
