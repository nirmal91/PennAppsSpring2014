Two men fighting over counterfeit compact discs inside a Midtown office building fell through the broken doors of a fourth-floor elevator entrance yesterday afternoon, plummeting three floors and hitting a stopped car, the police said.
The two men were both still conscious when they were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, the police said, with leg, head, neck and back injuries. They were identified as Robert Haynes, 34, and Mohammad Bahr, 26, whom, the police said, also gave his last name as Fofana. Mr. Haynes was listed in critical condition last night, and Mr. Bahr was in serious but stable condition.
Shortly before 3 p.m., people in the 10-story building, at 64 West 35th Street, heard screams and dialed 911, and the police ordered the elevator shut down. ''We made our way up to the second floor,'' said Sgt. Edward Allen, of the Emergency Service Unit's Truck 1. ''We had to force entry of the elevator doors there, and we slid down the cables.''
The officers found Mr. Bahr lying on top of the elevator car, bleeding heavily, and believed he was the only victim until they heard a second man's calls for help behind the car. It was Mr. Haynes, who was wedged between the back of the car and a wall, his head pinned by a metal bar, Sergeant Allen said.
Mr. Haynes's rescue was more difficult, the sergeant said. He had to be tied to the elevator with a rope so he would not slip. Then, officers used air bags and saws to free him.
Felix Correa, 21, said he was on the fifth floor and heard someone screaming for help. ''It was agonizing,'' he said, adding that it went on for 10 minutes. ''He was screaming out of pain and agony, saying he was stuck.''
The police said if one of the men was involved in selling counterfeit CD's, he could be charged.
