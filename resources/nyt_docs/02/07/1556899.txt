To the Editor:
Re ''Stopping the Traffickers'' (column, Jan. 31):
Nicholas D. Kristof's denunciation of feminist organizations shows a lack of awareness about the role that feminist organizations played in putting the sex trafficking issue on the United States policy agenda and about the role that we continue to play in enforcement of anti-trafficking laws.
Equality Now, the Feminist Majority and the National Organization for Women helped lead the drive to pass the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.
The law, which the Bush administration inherited rather than initiated, was signed into law by President Clinton, whose administration we frequently met with to advocate for the strongest definition of trafficking.
Mr. Kristof also ignored the conference, the first of its kind, that our National Center for Women and Policing held last May specifically to train police in enforcement of the law.
