Scientists singled out a rock called Adirondack for intensive exploration by the Martian rover Spirit in part because it looked relatively dust-free. But they said at a news conference they were surprised by how dusty it was and by how much its appearance had changed after the rover brushed it clean on Thursday. Geologists hope to better understand the history of Adirondack and its surroundings, a crater that may have once been an ancient lake bed.
