Madison Square Garden laid off 80 employees yesterday, or 3.5 percent of its work force, in an effort to cut costs.
The Garden, which is principally owned by Cablevision, said in a statement that the layoffs involved corporate and administrative employees and that they were needed to ''ensure that it operates with maximum efficiency.''
''We don't expect that the changes will affect the customer experience at the Garden,'' the statement said.
Layoffs and restructuring were recommended last year in a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, a management consulting firm.
Over the last few years, the Garden has been affected by the absence of the Knicks and Rangers from the playoffs, write-offs on contracts with retired Knicks like Larry Johnson and Luc Longley, and lower concert revenue at Radio City Music Hall, which is owned by Cablevision.
The loss of Yankees telecasts to the YES Network from the MSG Network has also affected the Garden's finances.
The Garden's revenue for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, was $107.8 million, 8 percent lower than for the comparable period in 2002. Revenue for the third quarter has declined by 25 percent since 2000.
For the nine months ending Sept. 30, the Garden's revenue decreased to $449.4 million from $477.6 million for the comparable period in 2002, a 5.9 percent decline. Since 2000, revenue during the first nine months of the year has diminished by 20 percent.
