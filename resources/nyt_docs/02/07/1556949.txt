To the Editor:
Re ''A Rude Awakening,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 5):
An ''Islamic Republic of Iraq,'' an ''Islamic Republic of Palestine'' or elsewhere would not necessarily have to be extremist.
The inclusion of the term ''Islamic'' in a country's name can just reflect the fact that the country is composed largely of people of the Islamic faith.
In fact, the use of ''Islamic Republic'' in an Islamic country's name lends legitimacy to the existence of Israel as a Jewish state.
If different peoples in the part of the world that gave birth to the great monotheistic faiths want to define their national identity at least partly in terms of their religious faith, I don't see why we should object to that.
