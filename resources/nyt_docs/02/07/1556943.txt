To the Editor:
Re ''How to Hack an Election'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Jan. 31):
Insecure voting machines undermine every American's faith in our democracy. Immediate action must be taken to prevent a repeat of the 2000 presidential election.
But simply requiring a voter-verified paper trail on electronic voting machines is a dangerously na√Øve solution.
If the machines are so easy to hack into, what would prevent someone from changing the software so that the machine prints out a vote for one candidate and records electronically a vote for the other?
It is obvious that electronic voting machines are not yet ready for use in a national election. Technologies like the simple paper ballot have sufficed for centuries, and can do so for a few more years.
Safeguarding our democracy is paramount. I, like most Americans, am not yet willing to entrust our democracy to voting machines whose security is so remarkably sub-par.
