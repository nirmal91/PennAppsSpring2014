To the Editor:
I know of no better way to undermine democracy than to adopt a computerized voting system in which people have no confidence (''How to Hack an Election,'' editorial, Jan. 31).
Let the computer industry eliminate the possibility of hacking. Then it can sell computerized voting. The same people who can steal your identity can steal your vote.
