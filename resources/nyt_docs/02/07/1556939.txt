To the Editor:
Reading ''The Administration's Scramble'' (editorial, Feb. 6) and ''Get Me Rewrite!,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 6), just reinforces the poor example the Bush White House is setting for children.
My son is 6 years old and already interested in politics. We talk about major news stories every day, and closely follow the election campaigns.
How does a strategy of pre-emptive war play out to children? If they told us, ''I hit him because he was planning to hit me,'' that would never fly. Even my 6-year-old believes that self-defense is the only rationale for a fight, and even then we must try to use words first to resolve differences.
My son has also already learned that not admitting he did something wrong is often worse than having made the original mistake.
Some honesty and humility would be a welcome change from this administration.
