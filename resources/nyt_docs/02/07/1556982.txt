Production credits yesterday with a TV Weekend review of ''The Forsyte Saga II'' were reprinted in error from an ABC entertainment series late last year. This ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation, which begins tomorrow night on PBS stations, was produced by Granada Television and WGBH Boston. The executive producers were Sita Williams and Andy Harries, Granada; and Rebecca Eaton, WGBH. It was directed by Andy Wilson. (The cast credits were correct.)
