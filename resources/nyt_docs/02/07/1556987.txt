Two young girls, ages 3 and 5, were attacked in their Bronx home by a family pit bull, the police said.
The girls, who were not identified by the police, were badly bitten, one in her lip area and the other on her head, the police said. The accident happened about 2 p.m.yesterday in their home on West 184th Street in University Heights.
They were taken to Montefiore Medical Center. A hospital spokesman, Steven Osborne, said the older girl was treated and released, while the younger girl underwent several hours of surgery and was in serious condition last night.
In an interview on Channel 9, Shannon Smith, who identified herself as the children's mother, expressed shock about what had happened, and said that her youngest daughter had severe facial and head injuries.
The police said the family had three dogs, though the girls' injuries were inflicted by one. The dogs were tranquilized and taken to the Animal Care and Control center on East 110th Street, the police said.
''The dogs are the family dogs,'' Corey Bellamy, a family friend, told Channel 9. They are not vicious dogs. ''They don't attack people.''
A police spokesman declined to say if criminal charges would be brought.
Correction:  February 10, 2004, Tuesday  An article in some copies on Saturday about two young Bronx girls who were attacked by one of their family's dogs gave an incorrect identification from the police for the dog's breed. It was a boxer, not a pit bull.
