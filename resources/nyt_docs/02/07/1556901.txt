To the Editor:
By choosing to embark on a duck-hunting excursion with Vice President Dick Cheney (news article, Feb. 6), Justice Antonin Scalia has exhibited judgment that is at best na√Øve, creating an unnecessary problem for himself as a result.
Given today's political environment, it is inevitable that any decision favoring Mr. Cheney will be decried as biased by the opposition. Whereas if Justice Scalia rules in favor of the two public interest groups, there will be legitimate questions as to whether he is trying too hard to appear impartial, particularly if the decision runs counter to past opinions. Had he simply declined the trip, Justice Scalia would not have to feel hunted now.
