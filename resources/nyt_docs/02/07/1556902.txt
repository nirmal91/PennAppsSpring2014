To the Editor:
Regarding your article about Daniel Wallace, author of the novel ''Big Fish,'' recollecting his father and my husband, Dan (''Discovering a New Spin for His Dad's Tall Tales,'' Arts &amp; Ideas, Jan. 31):
The man described was unknown to me, his widow. Dan was neither a cheat, liar, braggart nor bully. He was honest, self-deprecating, generous and fair.
The article related that Dan would pick a fight at each new school he attended. Dan came of age in the Depression and World War II. He was a big-eared, skinny farm boy transplanted to Queens, and then Alabama hill country. The New Boy Fight was a schoolyard ritual. He meant to convey, If you have to fight, do so on your own terms.
His son, coming of age in a radically different time, the 1970's of suburban affluence, social change and a gentler world of private schooling, heard something altogether different.
There can be no doubt of the strong bond of love between the two. It would be a tragedy for this article to stand as the true reflection of the father.
