Two days after the highest court in Massachusetts opened the door to gay marriage in that state starting in May, Gov. Bob Taft signed legislation making Ohio the 38th state to prohibit the recognition of same-sex unions. Critics say the bill is so sweeping that it will encourage litigation against colleges and businesses that provide domestic partner benefits. But in a statement, Governor Taft, a Republican, said, ''This is not a law of intolerance.''
