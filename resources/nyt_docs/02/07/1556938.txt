To the Editor:
Why was a conclusion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction such a leap of faith (editorial, Feb. 6)? Iraq actually used such weapons against its own citizens and neighbors, killing thousands. It had the required mat√©riel, and the technology to use these weapons effectively, a decade ago.
How difficult would it be to hide biological and nuclear material? A few hundred pounds of biologicals and a few pounds of nuclear material could easily be hidden in a place the size of a one-car garage.
Are Iraqis trying to help the United States in its search? Maybe, but not people who were or still are loyal to Saddam Hussein. People not in his inner circle probably don't know anything that would be helpful.
Would you rather have waited for an attack (on anybody) before launching an invasion against this murderous dictator? Not I.
