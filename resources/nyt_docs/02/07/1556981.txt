Because of a production error, most of a sentence was omitted in some copies yesterday from the last paragraph of a Sports of The Times column on the main sports page. The column supported a federal judge's decision that the National Football League's rule restricting younger players from entering the draft was in violation of antitrust laws. The affected passage, with the omission shown by brackets, should have read: ''[Pardon the metaphorical assault, but on the subject of the N.F.L. and its self-serving draft eligibility rules, even the judge of the United States District Court in Manhattan, in her ruling announced yesterday] in New York, couldn't help herself.''
