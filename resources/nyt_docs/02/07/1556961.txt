The snowboarding champion Tara Dakides was released from Bellevue Hospital Center last evening after being treated for injuries she sustained doing a snowboarding stunt for ''The Late Show With David Letterman'' on Thursday night, her manager, Stephen Astephen, said.
Ms. Dakides had had five stitches on her head and was aching from a sore tailbone, but was otherwise feeling fine, Mr. Astephen said. After two successful jumps on a ramp outside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Thursday during the taping of the show, Ms. Dakides hit a soft patch of snow and fell off the ramp. The taping was stopped and a rerun was broadcast.
Ms. Dakides, based in California, will appear on the show on Monday, but will not, Mr. Astephen said, be doing any stunts.
