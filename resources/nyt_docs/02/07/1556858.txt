The United States said Friday that it was making ''excellent progress'' with Libya in carrying out that country's decision to end its illicit weapon and missile programs and that curbs on travel by Americans and other sanctions could soon be lifted.
The announcement was made after a meeting in London between Libyan officials and William J. Burns, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. A meeting of Libyan, American and British officials had taken place earlier.
After Libya agreed in December to end its weapons programs and to pay $2.7 billion to relatives of the 270 people killed in the 1988 downing of a Pan American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, the United Nations formally lifted its sanctions.
The United States, however, said it would not follow suit until Libya began carrying out that agreement and took other actions against militant groups that would lead to its removal from the American list of countries that sponsored terrorism.
Mr. Burns and the Libyan officials ''discussed additional ways to increase contacts,'' including the possibility of lifting restrictions on the use of American passports for travel to Libya and letting American citizens engage in commercial transactions during their travels there.
The announcement also said the United States would pursue the possibility of sending medical and educational teams. Also discussed was the possibility of economic aid.
