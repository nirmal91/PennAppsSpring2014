George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, has agreed to stay in his post at least through the end of the year, according to three people close to him.
Mr. Tenet made the pledge in December after a personal appeal from President Bush, who had learned that the intelligence chief was thinking about stepping down, the people close to Mr. Tenet said. Mr. Bush even appealed to Mr. Tenet's wife, Stephanie Glakas-Tenet, by telling her that her husband's continued service was important to the country, the people said.
Mr. Tenet, who took office in 1997, has long told friends that he wanted to step down from his post. But Mr. Tenet has also told friends that he was not eager to leave at a time when the Central Intelligence Agency and the rest of the community are coming under criticism for their role in misjudging Iraq's stockpiles of illicit weapons.
Some members of Congress, including Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, have said that Mr. Tenet should resign or be fired because of the apparent misjudgments made by American intelligence agencies in providing prewar assessments about Iraq's illicit weapons.
But the White House has defended Mr. Tenet by saying that it is too soon to judge the extent of any intelligence failure on Iraq, and by noting that American intelligence agencies were not alone in having concluded that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons at the time of the American invasion last March.
Though he was appointed by President Bill Clinton, Mr. Tenet has forged a close personal relationship with President Bush, and meets with him six mornings a week to provide intelligence briefings.
