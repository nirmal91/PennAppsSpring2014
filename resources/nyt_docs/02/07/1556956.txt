Basketball fans from the Trinity School, one of New York City's elite private schools, chanted anti-Semitic slurs at a player from the rival Dalton School at a recent game, taunting him with references to gefilte fish, yarmulkes and other Jewish foods and customs.
The incident, at a game in the Dalton gymnasium on Friday last week, produced a storm of controversy, an investigation at Trinity, an apology to the Dalton parent who heard the remarks and complained and intensified classroom discussion at both schools. A spokesman for Trinity was unwilling to say whether or how the offending students would be disciplined. But details of the incident are not in dispute.
The parent, whose letter to Trinity's headmaster was widely distributed by e-mail messages and Web logs through private school circles in New York City, is Shelly Palmer, a television producer in Manhattan. He was attending the game with his 14-year-old son, and because the gym was crowded, they were seated in the Trinity section.
In both his letter to the headmaster, Henry C. Moses, and a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Palmer said he was inflamed by the behavior of the small group of students and the failure of anyone to challenge them.
''If they had been screaming about watermelon and collard greens, there would have been a race riot,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''Why is it O.K. to be anti-Semitic?''
It isn't, Mr. Palmer said he was told by Mr. Moses. The headmaster called him first thing Monday morning, after the letter had been hand-delivered to Trinity, which is on the Upper West Side. Mr. Moses assured him that he had taken the matter with utmost seriousness, was investigating and would take appropriate action.
''This guy was caught in the headlights, and he did the right thing,'' Mr. Palmer said.
That investigation was completed by week's end, said Joel Levy, the New York director of the Anti-Defamation League, who has offered to conduct diversity training at both schools. The results of the inquiry will not be made public, said Kevin Ramsey, a Trinity official, because the students are minors and entitled to privacy.
Mr. Ramsey said that the school would try to reinforce its commitment to ''an ethical education that teaches students the difference between right and wrong and how to choose to do what's right.'' Teachers have also been leading classroom discussions of the incident.
Mr. Palmer said he agreed that Trinity should keep the results of its investigation private and commended Mr. Moses' quick and thoughtful response. He and Mr. Moses had also discussed one section of his letter, a broad indictment of Trinity's culture, which in retrospect Mr. Palmer said was intemperate and unfair.
''I could have been more constructive,'' he said. ''But I was angry as I've ever been. I was totally unprepared for this. What skill set do I have to deal with something like this? It's easy to be Jewish in New York, or at least it was for me until last Friday night.''
Mr. Palmer said that the chanting, focusing on a student with the surname Goldberg, was led by two or three Trinity students but endorsed by the snickering and giggles of perhaps two dozen more seated near them. A few Trinity parents were also in the section, he said, but none tried to rein in the unruly behavior.
Then his son, whom Mr. Palmer asked not be identified, decided to leave the arena.
As the snickering and taunts continued, Mr. Palmer said, he tried to follow his son. A Trinity student blocked his path, and he said he swatted the boy out of his way. As he left the gym, he said, he was approached by a security guard who asked, ''Sir, did you lay your hands on a kid?'' He told the story to the guard, who offered to summon school authorities.
Mr. Ramsey, without challenging Mr. Palmer's account, said the school ''would not discuss specifics.''
Mr. Palmer chose instead to go home and write his letter. He said he has received more than 1,000 replies by e-mail. On a Web log frequented by parents and students from both schools, some commend his actions, and others accuse him of megalomaniac delusions.
Among those who contacted him, Mr. Palmer said, was the mother of the student who was taunted. She told him, he said, that her son had heard it all, but did not tell her until she asked about the incident. In tears, Mr. Palmer said, the mother thanked him ''for standing up for all of us.''

Anti-Semitism Still the Topic After Remarks During Game  By TAMAR LEWIN
Two weeks after a parent from the Dalton School sent the headmaster of the Trinity School a blistering complaint about anti-Semitic remarks at a basketball game between the two private schools, the uproar continues, amid strong disagreement about what actually happened.
One of the Trinity students involved in the incident, who was disciplined by the school this week -- and who is himself Jewish -- said in an interview yesterday that he and a friend had made three Jewish references during the basketball game: they had called a turnover a ''passover,'' termed a shot ''not kosher'' and said, after a basket, ''Dalton scored; light the menorah.''
Then, he said, the Dalton parent, Shelly Palmer, shouted and cursed at them and got into a physical altercation with him and other Trinity students. Several parents and students seated in the rows behind the boys supported that account.
Mr. Palmer rejected that description yesterday, saying that the incident involved a long litany of Jewish references chanted by a growing group of onlookers.
''I lost my temper, but the accusations that I physically assaulted anyone are patently false,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''I would never hit a kid.''
Trinity disciplined two 10th-grade students this week. While the school would not disclose the form of discipline, those close to the students said they were put on probation, required to perform community service and prohibited from attending Trinity sporting events as spectators for the rest of the year.
''I know Trinity had a difficult situation, and that seems reasonable,'' said the student who was disciplined, whose parents agreed to the interview on the condition that he not be named or photographed.
In his letter to the Trinity headmaster, Henry C. Moses, Mr. Palmer condemned Trinity officials and families for what he called anti-Semitism and intolerance.
At Trinity, officials and families both say Mr. Palmer's characterization is off the mark.
''The behavior of two Trinity students at the basketball game is unacceptable, and we've dealt with that behavior,'' Dr. Moses said this week. ''To suggest that the behavior of those two students is in any way characteristic of Trinity -- or its teachers or its students or its families -- is utterly reprehensible, and anyone who knows us knows that.''

In Internet postings on the incident, and in e-mail messages and conversations, Jewish Trinity families said there was no anti-Semitism at Trinity, where a survey two years ago found that 51 percent of the students had at least one Jewish parent.

''The Trinity School, when it comes to getting along between Jews and non-Jews, is a success story,'' said Nancy Chaffetz, a Trinity parent.
