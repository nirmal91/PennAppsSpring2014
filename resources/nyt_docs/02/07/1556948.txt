To the Editor:
Re ''A Rude Awakening,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 5):
Mr. Friedman claims that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel has ''had George Bush under house arrest'' and has him ''surrounded by Jewish and Christian pro-Israel lobbyists''; that Vice President Dick Cheney is ''ready to do whatever Mr. Sharon dictates''; and that they, as well as Mr. Bush's ''political handlers,'' are ''all conspiring to make sure the president does nothing'' to pressure Israel.
Allegations about Israel and its supporters ''conspiring'' to control the White House conjure up the kind of disturbing stereotypical images of Jews that extremists periodically circulate.
