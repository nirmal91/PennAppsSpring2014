Italian tax police searched the Milan office of the Swiss bank UBS, widening their investigation of financial fraud at the dairy and food giant Parmalat. UBS, the fifth non-Italian bank to be searched as part of the two-month-long investigation, is cooperating with Italian authorities, a spokesman for the bank said. UBS bought 420 million euros ($527 million) in bonds from Parmalat last year and has helped sell some of the company's debt. In another development, the founder of Parmalat, Calisto Tanzi, who has been in a Milan jail for more than a month, is likely to be transferred to a prison in Parma in the coming days, Italian newspapers reported.
