To the Editor:
Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 6) rightly decries the ugly electioneering of the Republican Party as manifested by the appeals some G.O.P. candidates make ''to the very worst in us.'' What he doesn't note is that the Democrats are no better when they batter the voters with class-warfare rhetoric as if the wealthy are public enemies.
