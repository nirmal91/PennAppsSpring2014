An article on Thursday about Prime Minister Tony Blair's appearance before the British House of Commons to defend his decision to go to war in Iraq misstated the position of a former official who appeared to question some of his assertions. Robin Cook was the leader of the House when he resigned from the government last March over Britain's decision; he was replaced as foreign secretary in 2001.
