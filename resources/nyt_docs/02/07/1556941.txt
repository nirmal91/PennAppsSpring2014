To the Editor:
At this too-late date we are told by George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, that ''when the facts on Iraq are all in, we will neither be completely right nor completely wrong'' (front page, Feb. 6). If the Bush administration knew this to be the case -- and it must have -- then how could it instigate a pre-emptive war, which surely must rely upon being ''completely right'' to be justified?
When it comes to sending our young men and women to die thousands of miles from home, not being completely right is horribly, and most wickedly, completely wrong.
