A Macon County jury awarded $1.6 billion to a woman who sued an insurance company and agent after paying for a nonexistent life insurance policy for five years. The woman, Carolyn Whittaker, said the company, Southwestern Life Insurance, was negligent in hiring her agent, James R. Perry, who accepted her monthly $50 payments for a $25,000 policy that she later found had been void since 1996. Alabama law could limit the punitive damages to three times the compensatory damages, which totaled $20 million.
