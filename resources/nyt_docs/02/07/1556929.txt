The Kansas City Council voted in favor of offering health care benefits to the unmarried domestic partners of its city employees. The Council, which opened a citywide domestic partner registry last year and extended sick leave and funeral leave benefits to include domestic partnerships, estimates that the newly adopted proposal will cost about $250,000 annually.
