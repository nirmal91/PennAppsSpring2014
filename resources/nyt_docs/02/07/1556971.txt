It began with just a few beeps. But the sound quickly swelled to a crescendo. Horns blared under the fists of angry drivers, who were stuck at a Midtown intersection.
The culprit was an errant traffic light. About 9 p.m. yesterday, a traffic light at the intersection of 33rd Street and Second Avenue stopped working. Drivers jockeyed for position, attempting to squeeze past one another. Tempers soared.
But it was the beeping that infuriated Jack Balos, a resident on the 14th floor of a high-rise on the corner.
''The horns,'' Mr. Balos said angrily. ''The horns keep blowing.''
The problem began earlier yesterday afternoon in Long Island City, Queens, when a power surge caused the Department of Transportation's traffic management center to lose power. The center switched to a generator. But when regular power was restored, about 9:30 p.m., the city's traffic lights began acting strangely, Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the department, said.
It was not just Midtown drivers -- and nearby residents -- that experienced difficulties. Mr. Cocola said the department had complaints of stuck and badly timed traffic lights on the Upper East Side, the Lower East Side, Queens and the Bronx.
By midnight most of the problems had been fixed, he said. Except for the light under Mr. Balos' window.
''The cars, they're trying to inch their way through the intersection,'' he said. ''A lot of people are being kept up right now.''
