A former police officer who has twice been tried on charges of using excessive force will not face trial a third time, the Los Angeles County district attorney said. The former officer, Jeremy Morse, 26, was videotaped punching a handcuffed suspect, Donovan Jackson, 16 at the time, and slamming him onto a patrol car on July 6, 2002, in Inglewood. Both trials ended in hung juries.
