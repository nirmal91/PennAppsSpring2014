Indoor track made its annual stop at Madison Square Garden last night with the 97th Millrose Games. Of the 40 running, jumping and throwing events over four hours, the one that drew the most attention was the last, the return of the celebrated sprinter Marion Jones after a 17-month absence.
Earlier in the night, when 22 Olympians were introduced one by one, the biggest cheers were for Jones. At night's end, the biggest cheers were for Jones again, before the women's 60-meter dash and especially after it.
Jones won in 7.21 seconds, the fastest time by an American this winter. She beat Angela Daigle (7.24) by a foot and Inger Miller (7.27) by an additional foot. The crowd of 14,154 went home satisfied.
While the spectators were waiting for Jones's race, the fires were kept burning by Olympians, world champions and world record-holders.
Allen Johnson, looking as relaxed as he would for a Sunday morning stroll, won the men's 60-meter hurdles in 7.43 seconds, a Garden and Millrose record and the fastest in the world this indoor season. At age 37, Gail Devers ran away with the women's 60-meter hurdles in 7.76 seconds, a Millrose record and also the world's best this year.
The men's shot-put, relegated to Manhattan College for 17 years, returned to the Garden with four world-class athletes competing. Christian Cantwell won with a distance of 69 feet 9 3/4 inches, making him the world leader this year.
In the storied Wanamaker Mile, the pace was brisk: 57 seconds for the first quarter-mile, 1 minute 58 seconds for the half. Then the pacesetter dropped out, and Hudson de Souza of Brazil, the only one staying close to the pacesetter, found himself far in front. He built a 30-yard lead and passed three-quarters of a mile in 2:59.5.
On the last of the 11 laps, the pace got to de Souza, and James Thie of Wales made a run at him. But there was too much territory to make up, and de Souza hung on to win in 4:02.93 to Thie's 4:04.28. As de Souza said, ''The pacemakers stopped, and I ran good. The mile is my race.''
No one argued.
In an era when sub-four-minute miles are common, de Souza's time seemed mundane. But the Garden's tight track, 11 laps to the mile, often leads to physical races and slow times. The straightaway for the sprints and hurdles is fast and leads to fast times.
In the 800-meter races, the men ran reasonably fast and the women unreasonably slow. The men's 800 included the world indoor champion, David Krummenacker, but 6-foot-3 runners like him have trouble making quick moves on small and tight indoor tracks. With a lap to go, he was third. He moved strongly with 80 yards left, ran out of room and finished second, in 1:50.38. He was a yard behind the smaller and quicker Berhanu Alemu of Ethiopia, who ran a 1:50.38.
The women's 800, as expected, was an easy race for Hazel Clark, an Olympian. She led from the start, and when no one tried to pass her, she won comfortably in 2:05.79.
The women's 500 yards proved a fact of life on these tracks: whoever gets the lead quickly can avoid high-speed traffic. Jearl Miles-Clark, Hazel Clark's sister-in-law, did that, leading from the start and cruising to a 6-yard victory over Sandie Richards in 1:03.68. Richards, from Jamaica, ran 1:04.51.
Year after year, outstanding athletes have returned to Millrose and have kept winning. No athlete since the retired miler Eamonn Coghlan has been as popular here as Stacy Dragila, the pole vaulter, and she showed why again. She won the women's vault by clearing 14-7 1/4, then made 14-11 and 15-2 3/4. She missed three times at what would have been a meet-record height, 15-6 1/4, but she had the satisfaction of winning here for the fifth consecutive year and the sixth time in seven years.
Tisha Waller won the women's high jump for the third year in a row and the eighth time in 12 years. Waller and Amy Acuff cleared 6 feet 3 1/2 inches, but Waller won because she made it on her first attempt and Acuff on her second.
''I love it here,'' Waller said. ''A lot of people have difficulty because there's so much going on.''
Miles-Clark's victory was her sixth in 12 years here; her previous victories were at 400 meters. Johnson won the hurdles for the fourth time in nine years.
Nicole Blood, a 14-year-old sophomore from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., won the girls' high school mile for the second consecutive year, this time by 35 yards in 4:52.41.
In the high school boys' mile, Hakon DeVries of John Jay in East Fishkill, N.Y., spurted ahead with a half-lap left and won by 5 yards in 4:14.29.
