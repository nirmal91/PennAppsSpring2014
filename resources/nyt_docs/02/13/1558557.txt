To the Editor:
Re ''Watching the Jobs Go By,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Feb. 11), is another wake-up call about math instruction. The previous call came in June, with the shockingly poor results for the New York Regents math test that is required for high school graduation. Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills asked a panel, of which I was a member, to investigate.
The commissioner accepted all our recommendations. As he moves on this agenda, the private sector must pitch in with financial support to help attract the best teachers and create a working environment that retains them.
The money businesses save by outsourcing should be reinvested in math education -- specifically, the preparation of effective teachers.
Outsourcing is not just costing jobs; it is also draining our most important natural resource, our brainpower.
