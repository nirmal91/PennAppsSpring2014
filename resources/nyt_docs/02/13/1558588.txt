David Zwirner  525 West 19th Street, Chelsea  Through Feb. 28
Almost 40 years ago in California, John McCracken invented his own distinctive spin on Minimalism: the plank. A glossy single-color slab, it was displayed in galleries leaning against the wall like a piece of lumber in a carpenter's workshop. The beauty of the plank, versions of which Mr. McCracken continues to produce painstakingly by hand in his New Mexico studio along with freestanding rectangular monoliths and smaller wall works, is partly in the way it hovers between painting and sculpture, confounding the viewer's categorical imperatives. There is also the polished, lushly colored fiberglass surface, which calls to mind the custom cars and surfboards that inspired the California Finish Fetish movement.
In Zwirner's main showroom, Mr. McCracken has installed two planks and four eight-foot-tall monoliths in a symmetrical arrangement that could be a set for a modern dance production. It also, like Stonehenge, harks back to some primordial religious architecture. Each piece is a different, luxuriously rich shade of red, blue or black, and the whole creates a compelling mix of ritualism, abstraction, material sensuousness and vernacular associations.
A single black monolith in the middle of a shoe-box-shaped gallery is like something out of a Stanley Kubrick movie. In a third gallery a set of 10 small vertical boxes in primary hues suggests the idea of color as not just a perceptual experience but as a physical substance.
