WITH the New Year's resolution crowd having dwindled, now is the perfect time to get serious about fitness. If it's been a while since your last workout, you should know that gyms are now called health clubs and the uniform is sporty chic. To fit right in, accessorize with some of these posh labels and high-tech gadgets. No sweat.
