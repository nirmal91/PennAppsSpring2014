Israel said Thursday that it would not take part in a hearing this month at the International Court of Justice on the legality of the contentious separation barrier that is under construction in the West Bank.
The court is to hear oral arguments at The Hague beginning Feb. 23 and is to issue a nonbinding ruling on the legality of the barrier, which faces fierce opposition.
The office of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said in a statement that the court ''has no authority to discuss the terrorism prevention fence since it concerns Israel's basic right of self-defense.''
Israel has built about one-quarter of the barrier, which is expected to stretch for more than 400 miles when completed. Under the route approved by Mr. Sharon's government, about 15 percent of West Bank land would be on the western, or Israeli side of the barrier, according to United Nations calculations.
Israel says the barrier is essential to preventing Palestinian suicide bombings, and that it cuts into the West Bank in order to incorporate Jewish settlements. Palestinians argue that the barrier's route takes large chunks of land that they are claiming for a future state.
