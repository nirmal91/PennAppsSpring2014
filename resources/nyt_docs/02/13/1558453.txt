To the Editor:
Re ''A Close Shave,'' by Carolyn Curiel (Editorial Notebook, Feb. 10):
It's no longer just men who are demanding a buffed look in their mates, but it's women as well. Apparently, the mere thought of having body hair is enough to kill any chance of having a love life.
Do men and women have nothing better to do than pluck, scrape, peel, wax and shave all day? I can't help but think that the multibillion-dollar cosmetics industry (with a little help from Madison Avenue) is behind this.
