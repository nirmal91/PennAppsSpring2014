Congress will audit spending by President Vicente Fox's office, taking aim at a charity led by his wife, Marta Sahagún. The charity, Vamos México, has donated little of the money it raises. Mr. Fox's political opponents say it may have used presidential money and staff, and call it a vehicle for his wife's ambition to succeed him in office in 2006. The couple were married in 2001; she had been his press secretary. Mr. Fox said he would cooperate with the audit and said no federal funds had been used to support the charity.
