Cable and Hayward, Wis.
WHEN  Feb. 20-21
WHY  About 15,000 spectators are expected next Saturday for the American Birkebeiner cross country ski race. The 51 kilometer ''Birkie'' is named for the  ''Birkebeiners,'' skiiers who wore birch-bark leggings and carried the infant future king of Norway to safety in 1206 during the Norwegian Civil War. Approximately 9,000 skiiers will compete in the Birkie and other shorter races. The Birkie starts in Cable (the first wave of skiiers departs at 8:20 a.m.) and finishes on Main Street in Hayward. Several preliminary events are scheduled for Friday, including a children's snowshoe hike, a family 10K ski and a Winter Sports Expo, where visitors can try out new equipment and talk to equipment experts. More information is at the Birkebeiner Web site, www.birkie.com, or available by calling (715) 634-5025. Most lodging in the area of the two towns is booked, although rooms are still available -- with a four-night minimum -- at the Telemark Resort, home to several of the weekend's activities. The Minneapolis airport is three hours away, but air fares there are considerably cheaper than to Duluth, which is an hour and a half away.
