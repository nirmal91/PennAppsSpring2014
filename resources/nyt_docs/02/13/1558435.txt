SITUATED in the Yampa River Valley in Colorado's northwestern corner, Steamboat Springs (population 10,115) exudes a subtle beauty. Fresh snow blankets the meadows and aspens and Douglas firs look as if they've been dipped in frost. Storms from the Pacific charge unimpeded into Steamboat releasing froths of ''champagne'' powder onto its peaks. (There has been nearly 15 feet of snowfall this season.) At 6,695 feet, Steamboat Springs is a true mountain town; in addition to skiers, you'll run across whitewater paddlers, mountain bikers and trail runners. One tip for visitors: if the combination of the high altitude and the high-quality beers sold at many of the town's restaurants and bars proves to be a debilitating combination, take advantage of the town's free bus shuttle that operates every 20 minutes from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. each day.

Friday
5 p.m.  1) Take a Soak  At Strawberry Park Hot Springs, seven miles north of town (44200 County Road 36, 970-879-0342; open Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. until midnight with entry by 10:30 p.m.; $10 adults, $5 for ages 13 to 17, $3 for ages 3 to 12), hot minerals springs from Copper Ridge mountain flow into Hot Springs Creek creating several warm or hot areas for swimming or soaking. Only adults are allowed after dark and clothing is optional. If your tastes run a little tamer, you can walk to the Steamboat Springs Health and Recreation Association center (136 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-1828) in town for a soak in one of its thermal pools ($7.50 adults; $5 for 13 to 17 year olds; $3.50 for those 3 to 12).
8 p.m.  2) Downtown Dining  Like most ski towns, Steamboat has its share of overpriced restaurants, but Tobiano's (345 South Lincoln Avenue, 970-879-1137) is one of the exceptions. Its inventive menu is organized into five different price categories ranging from $7 to $23. Try greens with candied walnuts and chevre ($7) or the mushroom-filled veal rolls with white truffle cream ($19). The Cottonwood Grill (701 Yampa Avenue, 970-879-2229) is another fine choice. The décor may suggest a Denny's restaurant rather than a fine dining establishment, but the setting along the Yampa River and the inventive Pacific-Rim food (like the tilapia fillet spread with shrimp kaffir mousse wrapped in rice paper, $29) more than make up for the uninspiring ambiance.
10 p.m.  3) Local Brews, Tequila Shots  Mahogany Ridge Brewery &amp; Grill (435 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-3773) features live bands on Fridays and Saturdays and serves up its own micro brews. Try Dave's Downtown Brown ($3 a pint). More music can be found Friday and Saturday nights during ski season at Levelz (1860 Ski Times Square; 970-870-9090), a three-tier nightspot near the mountain, where acts like Bo Diddley (March 20) perform (cover charge: $5 to $20). If you're not up for music, saunter over to the Cantina (818 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-0826). The owners travel to Mexico a couple of times a year, so the 30-plus tequila list is likely to include spirits -- like Casta Gusano ($9) -- rarely found north of the border.
Saturday
9 a.m.  4) Morning Mocha  With their dogs tied up outside, regulars help themselves to cups of coffee ($1 in the money jar) and sink into the loveseat or sofa at Mocha Molly's (635 Lincoln Avenue, 970-879-0587). Off in the corner, someone is almost always checking his e-mail at a computer with free Internet access. Fill up on a heaping bowl of oatmeal with fruit ($3) and a mocha latte ($2.75).
10 a.m.  5) On the Mountain  Take advantage of this season's abundant snow with a morning on the mountain (Steamboat Springs Ski Resort; www.steamboat.com; 970-879-6111; snow report 970-879-7300; open daily 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; daily lift tickets, $69). The 2,939-acre resort consists of six peaks in the Routt National Forest. The lifts -- four high-speed quads and an eight-passenger gondola, six doubles, six triples and a surface lift -- serve 143 trails. The Dome, a backcountry pitch, is ''the best ski line in Steamboat,'' says Jeremy Moore, a bartender at the Slopeside Bar and Grill. Since the resort is known for its tree skiing, check out Twistercane, the aspens between Twister and Hurricane. For an après-ski lunch, head to the Slopeside Bar and Grill (1855 Ski Time Square Drive, 970-879-2916) at the base of the mountain where hordes of snow-worshipers stretch out on plastic chairs to absorb the last of the fading sun.
3 p.m.  6) Shopping Break  Steamboat's downtown is a five-block stretch of weathered brick buildings along Lincoln Avenue. Pick up a punched-tin mirror ($95 to $175) at Embellishments (114 Eighth Street; 970-870-8808) or handmade silver and beaded jewelry ($5 to $25) at the Steamboat Art Company (903 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-3383). At F. M. Light &amp; Sons (830 Lincoln Avenue, 970-879-1822) you can find one-of-a-kind souvenirs like a Stetson hat ($179.99) signed by Billy Kidd, the 1964 Olympic skier who is director of skiing at the resort, or a jack-a-lope ($169.99), a stuffed rabbit with antlers. At the north end of town in a former train depot along the Yampa River, you'll find the Eleanor Bliss Center for the Arts (1001 13th Street, 970-879-9008), a gallery space and the administrative hub for a range of culture activities throughout town.
8 p.m.  7) Diva for a Night  Close out the day at Café Diva (1855 Ski Times Square; 970-871-0508), a charming bistro. Start with the crab and tomato bisque ($4 for a small portion) then move on to the Indian spiced chicken breast with chick pea fritters ($21) or the elk tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes ($24). The marble-tiled restroom with piped-in opera is a treat. There are only 20 tables, so a reservation is a good idea.
Sunday
10:30 a.m.  8) Backcountry Skiing  At nearly 10,000 feet, Rabbit Ears Pass (14 miles east out of town along Highway 40) offers an ideal introduction to the area's backcountry. Following the 3.7-mile West Summit Loop counterclockwise, you'll make a steady ascent through a mix of evergreen groves and open meadows (where snow crystals can look like goose feathers) to a plateau with stunning views of the entire Yampa Valley. Ski Haus International (1457 Pine Grove Road, 970-879-0385) rents cross-country equipment ($10 full day; $8 half day). It offers a free shuttle to your ski destination and trail maps.
1 p.m.  9) Backcountry Eating  After a morning in the backcountry, you'll want to head to Backcountry Provisions (635 Lincoln Aveune, 970-879-3617), on the second floor of Old Town Square, to refuel. The extensive sandwich menu includes favorites like the Avalanche (roast beef and Asiago cheese) and the Pilgrim (turkey and cranberry chutney), both $6.95.
THE BASICS  Visiting Steamboat Springs
Major airlines serve the Yampa Valley Regional Airport, 22 miles west of Steamboat, and Denver International Airport, 170 miles to the southeast.

Or you can hire a van from Storm Mountain Express (877-844-8787); prices vary (for example, $795 round trip for a group of up to seven). Given the density of the town and convenient transport to and from the mountain, you can do without a rental car.
