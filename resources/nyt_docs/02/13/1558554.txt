To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof is right in saying we need to put more effort and greater resources into our schools (column, Feb. 11). My sisters and I were beneficiaries of the Sputnik fear campaign of the late 1950's and early 60's.
But the loss of high-technology jobs to India will not be solved by teaching children algebra any earlier. Businesses are chasing lower wages, not a skill set.
We need to decide whether the social objectives served by our higher wages -- like adequate health care, safe working conditions and environmental protection -- are worth keeping. Those of us who think they are fear that American business focuses too much on math.
