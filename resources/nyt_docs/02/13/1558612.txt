A man fell to his death on Wednesday afternoon while trying to evade the police by hanging off an East Harlem roof, a police spokesman said yesterday. Narcotics agents were executing a search warrant at 1799 Lexington Avenue when the man, Simon Ambrose, 31, of the Bronx, fled to the roof and tried to hang over the wall, but lost his grip and fell seven floors, the police said. The officers found marijuana and arrested three men, Lawrence Shields, 29, and Jason Romero, 22, of the Bronx, and Jimmy Rooks, 22, of West 109th Street in Manhattan.
