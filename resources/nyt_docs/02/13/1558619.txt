Quarterback Ricky Ray, who led the Edmonton Eskimos to the Canadian Football League championship last season and has drawn large interest from N.F.L. teams, worked out for the Jets yesterday and then met with the Giants.
Vinny Testaverde's lawyer, Michael Azzarelli, said he had not spoken to the Jets since the end of the season, when the Jets said they wanted Testaverde back as their backup to Chad Pennington. Testaverde has said he would rather retire than be the No. 3 quarterback.
