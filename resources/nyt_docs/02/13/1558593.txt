A woman who said doctors at a Skokie hospital led her to believe she had multiple personality disorder has settled a malpractice suit for $7.5 million. The woman, Elizabeth Gale, 52, was treated for mild depression at Rush North Shore Medical Center for 11 years, ending in 1997. She said three doctors used repressed memory therapy and erroneously led her to believe she had been molested as a child and was a cult member. The hospital said the doctors no longer worked there.
