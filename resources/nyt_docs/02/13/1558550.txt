To the Editor:
In ''Watching the Jobs Go By'' (column, Feb. 11), Nicholas D. Kristof suggests that the average upper-middle-class student in Bangalore has a better math and science education than the average American child.
But why not compare apples and apples: the average upper-middle-class child in Bangalore with the average prep-school student in America? The problem is that no matter how well you do in high school here, you will be competing with a college graduate there who will work for a fraction of your salary.
Would Mr. Kristof trade the education system in India for ours? Ask the poor in Bangalore if they would like to attend even the lowest-rated public school in New York City or their own, assuming they can even attend school.
