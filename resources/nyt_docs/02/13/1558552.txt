To the Editor:
In an effort to avoid dangerous thoughts that might lead to protectionism, Nicholas D. Kristof prefers to blame American students' math scores for the outsourcing of jobs (column, Feb. 11).
But if business can find cheaper labor abroad, it has little incentive to support the big public investment needed to improve student performance. And as these jobs disappear, American students have less incentive to invest in technical careers.
Mr. Kristof tells us that similar fears of outsourcing a few years ago were unfounded because in the end ''free trade worked.'' That is hard to reconcile with the expansion of America's trade deficit.
When the day of financial reckoning arrives, we will find that the problem was not that our children lacked skills, but that our leaders -- and pundits -- refused to deal with economic reality.
