Dozens of people who say they were wrongly arrested at an antiwar protest last spring filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan late Wednesday against New York City and the Police Department, seeking redress for bogus arrests, false imprisonment, assault, and malicious prosecution, among other things. At a news conference yesterday, the plaintiffs claimed that they were within the law on April 7, 2003, when they stood on the north side of 56th Street in Midtown and looked on as others lay on the sidewalk on the south side to block the entrance of a building, which the plaintiffs claim housed a business that stood to profit from the war in Iraq. There were 94 arrests in all, for civil disobedience and obstructing government administration, the police said at the time, adding that protesters were blocking pedestrian traffic. Out of the 52 plaintiffs, according to the group, two people were tried and acquitted. Of the rest, only one is still facing charges, according to members of the group. A spokeswoman for the city's legal department said that the suit had not yet been received. , but that it would be evaluated thoroughly.
