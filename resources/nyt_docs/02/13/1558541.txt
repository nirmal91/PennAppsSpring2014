The European Commission has opened an investigation into the merger planned by the record companies Sony of Japan and BMG, a unit of the German publisher Bertelsmann. The commission said the deal might ''create or strengthen a collective dominant position of the major record companies in the markets for recorded music.'' It said Sony BMG would have a market share of about 25 percent, and with its biggest rival, Universal, would control about half of the recorded music market.
