''Across Borders'' pairs the Chilean-born Juan Downey (1940-1993), an early user of video art, with Francesc Torres (born 1948), a native of Barcelona, who works in video and other mediums. What the two have in common, apparently, is that both ''crossed borders'' to come to the United States, and that their art reflects the human tragedy of disruption by psychic and societal upheavals in many parts of the world.
The interplay between two allegorical video installations is the heart of the display. Downey's ''About Cages'' is a large enclosure that confines four live canaries, who chirp and cavort, dominated by a larger video image of an equally captive bird. Two audio tapes accompany the images, one of a woman reading excerpts from ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' the other of a man confessing to the torture of victims during Chile's rightist regime of the 1970's. The work is meant to show the cruelties of confinement against the yearning for freedom.
Mr. Torres's chef d'oeuvre is a life-size image of a woman, made of plexiglass and suspended in the air. Her upper body is nude, the lower half wrapped in a towel with a video projection of flames licking at it. Her hands cover her eyes; she is in an agony of physical and mental torture. The work seems to evoke the fragility of the human condition, seeking a place of expression for the soul but beset by dangers on all sides.
Each piece is accompanied by others: in Downey's case, symbolic drawings embodying the cultural heritage of the Yanomami Indians of Brazil, with whom he once lived. Among other works by Mr. Torres is a row of terra cotta tablets, artifacts imprinted with shreds of life stories, mournfully lined up above a crumbling gold-painted relic of a skull.
Despite its good intentions, the show doesn't really mesh. Downey comes off the stronger. One would rather see separate shows of each artist's work.
