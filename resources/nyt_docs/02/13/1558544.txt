The Zurich stock exchange said it had opened a formal investigation into Adecco, the large employment services company, to establish whether the Swiss group failed to provide investors with timely market-sensitive information. Adecco, which is listed in Zurich and on the New York Stock Exchange, said it was cooperating with the inquiry but declined to comment. The Zurich stock exchange, which opened a preliminary inquiry last month, said its action was prompted by Adecco's disclosure on Jan. 12 that it had found accounting problems in its North American unit, Adecco Staffing, and that as a result, 2003 results would be delayed.
