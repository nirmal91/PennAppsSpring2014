To the Editor:
In ''Watching the Jobs Go By'' (column, Feb. 11), Nicholas D. Kristof cites ''a tendency in U.S. intellectual circles to value the humanities but not the sciences,'' and says, ''Anyone who doesn't nod sagely at the mention of Plato's cave is dismissed as barely civilized.''
Having taught history at the college level, I can tell you that very few Americans graduate from high school knowing anything about classical philosophy. Nor do they know much about literature, history or any of the other humanities. The truth is that too many American schools teach neither the humanities nor the sciences well.
