Gov. Mike Huckabee signed a bill to guarantee financing for public schools. The legislation provides that money be diverted to education from other state accounts if tax collections cannot fully finance schools. The new law was one of several enacted in response to a State Supreme Court finding that public schools in Arkansas were unconstitutionally underfinanced.
