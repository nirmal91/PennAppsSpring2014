The New York City Fire Department will increase the number of engine companies with five firefighters instead of four to 60 from 45. The increase stems from an agreement negotiated last June with the Uniformed Firefighters Association that called for the full return of five-firefighter staffing in 60 engine companies on July 1, 2004, if specific reductions in medical leaves by firefighters were met. Medical leave levels were reduced ahead of schedule, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday, so the 15 engine companies will receive a fifth firefighter beginning tomorrow.
