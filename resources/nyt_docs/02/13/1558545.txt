India's industrial output rose at an annualized rate of 6.2 percent in December, fueled by demand from the farm sector, which profited from a strong growing season. The government report supported estimates that the gross domestic product could grow more than 8 percent in the fiscal year ending in March. For the first nine months, industrial output rose 6.3 percent.
