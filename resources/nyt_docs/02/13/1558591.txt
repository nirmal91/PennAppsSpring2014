Three pharmacists in Denton were fired after refusing to fill a prescription for emergency contraception for a woman who said she had been raped, one of them, Gene Herr, said. Mr. Herr said the three had acted on moral grounds. The Eckerd Corporation, which owns the pharmacy, said only that it had taken ''the appropriate disciplinary action.''
