To the Editor:
''Grading the Mayor on Schools'' (editorial, Feb. 9) doesn't portray the reality of school reform and social promotion policy in New York City.
The Department of Education is committed to following every child in order to understand who is doing well, who is struggling and where those who are struggling need help.
For years in our schools, large numbers of students have been promoted even though those students were not prepared for the next grade. The result is that many students are passed through the system from one grade to another until they ultimately end school without being remotely educated or prepared.
As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced recently, we are going to stop this cycle and intervene early to ensure that children master the skills they need to progress and achieve at grade level. In third grade, we are now going to require that our students meet basic literacy and math standards in order to progress to the fourth grade.
We are providing additional interventions to our struggling third graders to help them succeed. That is what they need most.
