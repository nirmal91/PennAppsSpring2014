A 12-year-old girl was taunted and attacked by several classmates Tuesday afternoon during a bus ride home from school, the Glen Cove police said. The girl lost consciousness and was taken to North Shore Hospital after being hit in the head with a pocketbook or book bag, the police said, but they said they did not know whether the girl had been knocked out or suffered an anxiety-induced seizure. The 12-year-old, whose name was not released, was placed on a ventilator, but she had been taken off the device yesterday afternoon and was undergoing tests. The police said no one had been arrested in the case, but the girls who attacked her had been suspended from school.
