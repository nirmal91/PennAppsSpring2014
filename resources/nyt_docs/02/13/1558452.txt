To the Editor:
As Maureen Dowd notes, the White House continues to praise ''its good buddy Pakistan'' despite the fact that Pakistan's chief nuclear scientist was selling atomic secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya (''The Khan Artist,'' column, Feb. 12).
In the decades after World War II, the United States turned a blind eye to the despotic shenanigans of countless dictators, provided that those dictators swore an oath against the scourge of Communism. (Does anybody remember that Saddam Hussein used to be our ally?)
Today, the litmus test of loyalty is proclaiming opposition to terrorism. Never mind that some of our friends in this fight are themselves aiding terrorist states.
Will we never learn?
