A former Marine accused of abducting a 12-year-old British girl he met over the Internet pleaded guilty in a Manchester court to charges of abduction and incitement to gross indecency. The man, Toby Studabaker, 32, of Michigan, flew from Detroit to Manchester to meet the girl last July, after they had had several online conversations. They flew together to Paris and set off an international police hunt. The girl returned to Britain after a few days. Mr. Studabaker was arrested in Frankfurt in August. He is to be sentenced in April.
