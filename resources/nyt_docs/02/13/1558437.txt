To the Editor:
Re ''Syria Said to Send Arms Again to Lebanon Guerrillas'' (news article, Feb. 6):
These accusations are unfounded and false.
The claims, coming originally from some Israeli officials, arose in direct response to the call for peace by President Bashar al-Assad in his interview with The New York Times published on Dec. 1.
Some Israeli commentators similarly concluded that the accusations emerged simply as another indirect way to rebuff Syrian overtures for peace.
The Syrian calls for peace are genuine and in good faith. It is sad that such earnest overtures could generate these allegations and tarnish Syrian humanitarian aid efforts.
