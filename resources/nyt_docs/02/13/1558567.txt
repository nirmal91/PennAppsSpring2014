A federal appeals court panel has upheld a New York State law blocking direct shipments of out-of-state wine to consumers in the state, reversing a lower court's finding that the ban was unconstitutional.
The decision, by Judges Jon O. Newman, Sonia Sotomayor and Richard C. Wesley of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, said that New Yorkers already have access to out-of-state wines, and that the state was not discriminating against out-of-state wineries in prohibiting sales of their wines directly to consumers through means like the Internet.
''New York's regulatory scheme allows licensed wineries, whether in state or out of state, direct access to a market of sophisticated oenophiles,'' Judge Wesley wrote in the decision released yesterday. And it does so ''in a nondiscriminatory manner, while targeting valid state interests in controlling the importation and transportation of alcohol.''
The lower court judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court, found the law, which requires out-of-state wineries to sell in New York only through wholesalers, to be discriminatory and intended to protect New York wineries. ,
