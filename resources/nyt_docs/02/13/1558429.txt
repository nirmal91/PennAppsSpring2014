To the Editor:
Bob Herbert says it might be time for a ''bipartisan truth squad'' to follow President Bush around, to sort out the facts from his ''musings, speculations, fantasies and mis-rememberings'' (''Lost in Credibility Gulch,'' column, Feb. 9).
Not a bad idea, though I remember when this was a standard function of the best journalism. Failure of today's news outlets to subject the current administration to close scrutiny is a real threat to our nation's security, because now as before, democracy relies for its survival on an informed citizenry.
