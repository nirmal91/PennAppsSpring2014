Robert A. Durst, the New York real estate heir who was acquitted of murdering his Galveston, Tex., neighbor last November, was indicted on another criminal charge yesterday as he sat in a Texas jail. A grand jury indicted him on a charge of ''tampering with physical evidence,'' a reference to his decision to butcher his 71-year-old neighbor and throw the body parts in Galveston Bay. Bail was set at $1 billion, bringing his total to a record $3 billion. Although he admitted cutting up the neighbor, a jury found Mr. Durst not guilty of murder after he claimed that the two men struggled over a pistol, which went off accidentally in the neighbor's face. But Mr. Durst had remained in the county jail on charges of bail-jumping. ''It's awfully late and awfully retaliatory,'' Dick DeGuerin, one of Mr. Durst's lawyers, said yesterday.
