The Canadian property company Brascan raised its bid for the Canary Wharf office development in London to Â£1.6 billion ($3.03 billion), matching an earlier offer made by a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. The two have been battling for eight months for control of the company. Brascan has the backing of the company's founder and a major shareholder, Paul Reichmann.
