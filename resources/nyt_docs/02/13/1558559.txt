To the Editor:
Re ''Just What Killed the Diet Doctor, and What Keeps the Issue Alive?'' (news article, Feb. 11):
I remember using the Atkins diet many years and many pounds ago, and it worked, albeit for a time. I soon got more ill tempered (''as if that were possible,'' my wife reminds me) as the diet progressed.
Well, I eventually slipped, or should I say leaped, off the diet, as my cravings for pizza, pasta and pie overwhelmed me.
Dr. Robert Atkins was not to blame; my own habits were, and they came back to haunt me.
Now I am older, much lighter and, one hopes, wiser as I plod on, with a simple diet formula: I eat a lot less most of the week and normally on the weekend.
I exercise and eat less, and the weight drops a bit each week. I can still look forward to a glass of red wine with my pasta on Saturday.
Perhaps Dr. Atkins did not fail; I did not fail. The battle never ends.
Dr. Atkins obviously suffered at life's end, but perhaps he should not be condemned for being human.
