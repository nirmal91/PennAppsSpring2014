To the Editor:
Re ''This Is Your Proselytizer Speaking'' (editorial, Feb. 11):
As you suggest, air travel in the post-9/11 world is unnerving enough without the impromptu antics of pilots who have priority problems. The pilots are there to fly the planes safely, not to talk about religion to their passengers, who already fly with knots in their stomachs.
If preaching the Gospel is more important to Roger Findiesen, an American Airlines pilot, than flying, he should switch jobs and become a clergyman. Perhaps we passengers would be more willing to listen to him in a church.
