The commander of American forces in the Middle East dropped in for a visit here Thursday, and Iraqi gunmen were waiting for him.
They were hiding on a rooftop along the main road, and when Gen. John P. Abizaid strode inside an Iraqi civil defense station, they opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades. They fired three times at the general's convoy but missed the general himself, who had already entered the station.
American soldiers responded with a firestorm of gunfire and cannon, and the shooting lasted for at least a minute. Then the gunmen disappeared. The Americans searched a nearby mosque but found nothing.
In a few minutes, it was over, and General Abizaid was on his way. Later in the day, American officials said they would investigate the incident. But they said they were skeptical of suggestions that the Iraqis had advance word of the general's visit.
''I would challenge your assertion that there was foreknowledge,'' Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the deputy chief of operations here, said in response to a reporter's question. ''We are going to take a hard look at what happened.''
After the attack, the Iraqi officers said they had been much impressed with General Abizaid, for his fluent Arabic and his calm under fire. But they, too, dismissed the suggestion that someone in their organization could have tipped off the Iraqi gunmen.
The Iraqi officers did concede, however, that they knew at least two days in advance that someone important was coming here for a visit.
''We didn't know who it was, but we were told that someone was going to visit,'' said Maj. Ahmed Hamudi, the chief of the office. ''Of course, no one in our organization would tell anyone. Only a limited number of people knew about it.''
