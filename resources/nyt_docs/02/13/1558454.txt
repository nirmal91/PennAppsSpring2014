To the Editor:
The Brazilian Workers' Party rejects the allegations you reported that the death of Mayor Celso Daniel of Santo André in January 2002 was related to an alleged corruption scheme involving Workers' Party members (news article, Feb. 1). These allegations are incompatible with the truth as established by the police and validated by court rulings.
The Workers' Party was not in any way in command of the law enforcement agencies that conducted the investigation into Mayor Daniel's death and that determined that the crime was unrelated to corruption and ultimately arrested the offenders. Consequently, the Workers' Party was not in the position to cover up facts, hide evidence or have any sort of biased attitude that could affect the outcome of the police investigation.
The Workers' Party has always advocated a serious, competent and technical investigation into the murder of one of its main leaders. What the Workers' Party does not accept are political attempts to dishonor some of its most senior members, the party itself and, above all, Celso Daniel.
