To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof argues in ''Watching the Jobs Go By'' (column, Feb. 11) that America needs to do a better job of educating its young in math and the sciences. I agree, but the idea that this will necessarily lead to better employment for Americans misses the mark.
There are now large numbers of highly qualified programmers, engineers and scientists in this country who are out of work, because companies have chosen to move their jobs offshore. The problem is not a lack of talent in the labor pool, but the reluctance of American businesses to pay American wages for technical skills.
