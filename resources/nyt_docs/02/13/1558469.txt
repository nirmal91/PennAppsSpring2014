''Have you ever been arrested, indicted or convicted for any violation of civil or military law?'' a form in President Bush's National Guard file asks. But the answer in the publicly released form, published on Thursday in USA Today, is blacked out, suggesting the worst.
So on Thursday, Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, who has accused the Democrats of ''trolling for trash'' in the president's record, did not even wait for anyone to ask.
''Let me tell you what was in that blacked-out part,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters traveling with the president on Air Force One. He was brandishing a clean copy of the very same form.
Behind the black ink, Mr. McClellan said, was a misdemeanor in New Haven in December 1966, a charge that was dismissed. Mr. Bush, he said, had stolen a wreath while a student at Yale in what has become a widely known prank.
Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush's form also listed two speeding tickets, in July and August of 1964 in Houston traffic court, with $10 fines, and two collisions, in July and August of 1962, also in Houston traffic court, with $25 fines.
''I'm just amazed by the kinds of conspiracy theories that some have chosen to pursue,'' Mr. McClellan said.
But reporters were now on to a new conspiracy theory.
''Just to keep trolling for a moment,'' a reporter began, then questioned why such minor infractions were blacked out in the first place.
Mr. McClellan blamed the National Guard, saying that when government agencies release information ''there are privacy issues involved.''
