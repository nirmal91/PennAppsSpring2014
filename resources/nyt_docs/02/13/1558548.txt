GOLF'S little world is all agog these days because Vijay Singh has finished in the top 10 in 12 consecutive PGA Tour events. If he finishes that high again this weekend in the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines near San Diego and also in his next tournament, he will tie Jack Nicklaus's record -- what the PGA Tour describes as the modern record.
So what? Singh deserves to know that he and Nicklaus are nowhere near the real streak of 65 straight top 10's in individual events that Byron Nelson established from 1942 to 1946.
Or that Ben Hogan, according to PGA Tour player records, had streaks of 28 and 26 top-10 finishes, Walter Hagen a streak of 25, Sam Snead streaks of 19, 18 and 15, and Billy Casper one of 17.
The PGA Tour doesn't sanction Nelson's or the others' streaks as official because they occurred in golf's dark accounting ages. The results of a relatively obscure tournament might not have been recorded. If a touring pro didn't make the 36-hole cut, his scores might have been discarded.
''Before 1970, when the PGA Tour separated from the Professional Golfers Association of America,'' Dave Lancer, the PGA Tour's director of information, said, ''records were sketchy.''
But in Nelson's case, the records are not sketchy. The records are in his handwriting in the notebook he kept of results and earnings from each of his tournaments from 1935 to 1946. When his ''Little Black Book'' was published in 1995, it contained photocopies of several pages from his original notebook.
''Philadelphia Open 68-68-70-63 -- 269 won by 2 strokes $2,500,'' reads a page from 1945 during his record 11 consecutive tournament victories for which he is famous. ''Chicago Victory National Open 69-68-68-70 -- 275 won by 7 strokes $1,500.''
According to Nelson's PGA Tour record, from the Texas Open in early 1942 through the New Orleans Open in early 1946, he not only was never out of the top 10 in 65 consecutive tournaments (omitting two-man team events), but he was also in the top three in, remarkably, 53 of the 65 -- 29 victories, 13 seconds, 11 thirds.
''At the time,'' Nelson, now 92, said Tuesday by telephone from his Roanoke, Tex., ranch, ''there was so little talk of things like top 10's, I wasn't even aware of that streak. When you start figuring out what you need to do to finish in the top 10, that's all you'll do when you're playing well. You have to set winning as your goal.''
Was it possible that somewhere during that streak of 65 that the golfer known as Lord Byron might have finished worse than 10th somewhere in an obscure tournament that somehow never found its way into his PGA Tour player record?
''Not that I know of,'' he said.
Nor is it very likely that such a tournament existed. If Nelson had played off the beaten path in those years during World War II, it suddenly would not have been an obscure event. Unlike today's Tour, where some golfers accumulate millions without winning, in Nelson's time there was usually no prize money if you didn't finish in the top 20.
''I was just trying to put away enough money to buy this ranch,'' said Nelson, who virtually stopped playing tournament golf at age 33 after the 1946 season. ''All I thought about was making money in every tournament.''
Even though some of the better pros were in military service during the World War II years, no golfer -- not Nicklaus, not Hogan, not Tiger Woods -- has been as consistently dominant on the Tour as Nelson was during that streak of 65 top 10's -- consistently straight with his shots, consistently high in the prize money.
''I've always been a pretty consistent person,'' he said. ''I was taught by my parents to do the best you can do all the time, and I've tried to do that.''
Woods, for all his success, had a streak in worldwide events of 12 top-10 finishes that ended early last year. He has also had streaks of 11 and 10. According to Lancer, Arnold Palmer's best streak was 12, and Tom Kite and Greg Norman each had 11 in a row.
''I wouldn't be surprised,'' Gary Player said, ''if I had a streak of 20 consecutive top 10's somewhere, but there's no way to prove it.''
Bobby Jones, an amateur who was better than the pros of his era, had modest streaks interrupted by a fourth-round loss in the 1921 British Amateur, a tie for 11th in the 1927 United States Open and a first-round loss in the 1929 United States Amateur.
And after Nelson's streak ended with a tie for 14th (worth $153) at the 1946 Pensacola Open, he had another streak, according to his player record, of 19 top-10 finishes (with three victories). That's 84 top 10's in a span of 85 events over seven years.
What happened at Pensacola?
''I had started looking for a ranch to buy,'' Nelson recalled, ''and a friend of mine up in Denton, Tex., who owned a cafe on the plaza there, Harry Ray, called me just before I went to Pensacola and asked me to take a look at it. That's the ranch I eventually bought, and thinking about buying it was a little distraction when I was in Pensacola.''
Byron Nelson laughed softly. ''I hadn't thought of that,'' he said, ''until you reminded me of Pensacola.''
