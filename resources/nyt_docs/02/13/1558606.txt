An article and a picture caption on Feb. 2 about the relocation of Thurgood Marshall Academy to a new building in Harlem referred incorrectly to an apartment in a neighboring building owned by Jeanne Littlejohn, who has filed a lawsuit claiming that it was damaged during construction. It was a rental apartment; she does not live in the building.
