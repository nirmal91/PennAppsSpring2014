A senior House Republican and several ranking House Democrats warned top Pentagon officials on Thursday that the military's proposed budget for next year faced a tough fight on Capitol Hill.
Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, said the growth in overall military spending made the Pentagon's $401.7 billion budget request for the 2005 fiscal year vulnerable to cutting in favor of domestic programs.
''People will be targeting our budget in a serious way,'' said Mr. Lewis, who generally supports increased military spending.
The Democrats complained that the likely costs of future operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were not being addressed in the proposed budget.
''We can argue all we want about policy,'' said David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the committee's senior Democrat, ''but at least the basic thing government ought to be able to do is come up with a straightforward, honest set of numbers.''
The administration has said it will make a supplementary request of up to $50 billion to pay for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not until January, after this year's elections.
