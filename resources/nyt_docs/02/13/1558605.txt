An article yesterday about pressure on Consolidated Edison to improve public safety after the electrocution of a woman on a street in the East Village misstated the location of a public hearing by the State Assembly Energy Committee that is scheduled for 11 a.m. today. It will be in Manhattan (at 250 Broadway, near Murray Street), not in Albany.
