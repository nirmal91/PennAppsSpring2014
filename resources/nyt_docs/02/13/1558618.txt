Whether the firm is paid or not, officials at Standard &amp; Poor's said yesterday that it would proceed with a study it is preparing for a state commission that is charged with determining the cost of a sound, basic education for New York's schoolchildren. State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi last month rejected a $1.2 million no-bid consulting contract awarded to the Wall Street firm by the commission because of a potential conflict of interest. Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, said the firm was already being paid millions of dollars by the state for other work. The commission, which was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki and is charged with coming up with recommendations for fixing inequities in school financing, has until March to deliver its findings.
