To the Editor:
Re ''Just What Killed the Diet Doctor, and What Keeps the Issue Alive?'' (news article, Feb. 11):
During the many occasions that I met with Dr. Robert Atkins while under his personal care in New York, I appreciatively hugged him to express my heartfelt gratitude for his advice.
I wish to assure the many people who follow his diet that he was fit in body and personally set an example for healthy living.
To suggest otherwise is merely an attempt to rewrite history.
