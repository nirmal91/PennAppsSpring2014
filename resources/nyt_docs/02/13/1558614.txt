The police arrested a Queens man yesterday in the killing of an off-duty Rikers Island correction officer in a shooting at a birthday party in Queens last week, the authorities said. The man who was arrested, Derrick Coleman, 27, of 139-06 219 Street in Jamaica was charged with second-degree murder and weapons possession. Three other people were injured in the shooting, which occurred at 3 a.m. Feb. 7 at the Lebanon Lodge, a Masonic hall at 107-51 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in Jamaica. The correction officer, Gregory G. Goff, 24, above, died at Mary Immaculate Hospital after the shooting, the police said. The shooting stemmed from a fight over a woman and two other men fired shots in the incident, the police said, and their investigation was continuing.
