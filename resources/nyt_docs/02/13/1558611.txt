With more than 30,000 commuters passing through its turnstiles daily -- about 12,000 more than expected -- the newly reopened World Trade Center PATH station has already regained its position as the busiest station in the system on weekdays, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday. Passengers began using the spartan, temporary, open-air station on Nov. 23, after more than two years of having to find other ways to get between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan. Ridership quickly exceeded the Port Authority's forecasts, with more than 20,000 passengers coming through the station only two days after it opened. The weekday average since Jan. 15 has been more than 30,000 riders, placing the trade center station ahead of the 33rd Street station in Midtown. The authority had not expected that to happen until 2006. (Some 26,500 riders use the 33rd Street station.) Overall daily PATH ridership has increased to 180,000 from 160,000 last November, said Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the authority. Yet there are still fewer than half the number of riders who came through the World Trade Center station on Sept. 10, 2001.
