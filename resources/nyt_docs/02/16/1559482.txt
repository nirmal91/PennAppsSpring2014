New York City is not doing enough to provide heating assistance to low-income families who are eligible for the federal subsidy, Betsy Gotbaum, the public advocate, said yesterday. Ms. Gotbaum said a study by her office estimated that at least 237,000 eligible families were not receiving the aid, which can range from $50 to several hundred dollars each winter, depending on need. Inadequate efforts by the city to make families aware of the benefit is largely to blame, she said. Roughly 370,000 households in the five boroughs currently receive heating assistance, according to the city's Human Resources Administration. A spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dismissed the concerns and questioned the methodology used by the public advocate.
