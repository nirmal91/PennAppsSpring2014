An obituary on Wednesday about Claude Ryan, a former leader of the Quebec Liberal Party who helped defeat a referendum in 1980 on secession from Canada, referred imprecisely to a rule he later helped promulgate. The rule, which banned the use of English on outdoor commercial signs, replaced part of the original ''French only'' language law, known as Bill 101; the rule itself was not known as Bill 101.
