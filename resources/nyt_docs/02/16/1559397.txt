Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts posted a digital video attacking President Bush on his Web site late Saturday, responding in kind to video posted on President Bush's campaign Web site on Thursday.
Answering charges that he was beholden to lobbyists despite promises to limit their influence in Washington, Mr. Kerry's spot highlights far greater contributions from special interests to Mr. Bush.
With a camera focused on the White House, the spot opens with an announcer saying, ''He's taken $3.2 million from big oil and gas companies,'' and then goes on to list other industries and donors that have given substantially to Mr. Bush.
''He's taken $1.4 million from drug companies,'' it says, and, ''Enron has been his single biggest contributor.''
Most of the figures came from the same organization that the Bush campaign cited in its video, the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign finance trends.
''The president really highlighted a weakness of his own,'' said Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's press secretary. ''Voters are saying, 'What a hypocritical act for him to call John Kerry the candidate of special interests when he is the king of special interests.' ''
Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary, Terry Holt, said the Web video pointed out that Mr. Kerry had collected nearly $640,000 from lobbyists during his career because it contrasts with Mr. Kerry's warning to ''the powerful interests'' in Washington: ''We're coming, you're going, and don't let the door hit you on the way out.''
