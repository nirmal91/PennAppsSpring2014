HERE are some nameplates that you may recognize from other types of vehicles, but seem out of place on a pickup:
Crosley: Crosley, a maker of tiny, gas-sipping cars, lopped the rear off its 26.5-horsepower sedan to make a pickup, of sorts, from 1947-52.
DeSoto: Beginning in the late 30's, Chrysler put the name of its midprice automobiles on pickups built for export. Essentially Dodges, they were sold in Europe and Australia until 1961, when DeSoto production ceased.
Diamond T: From the late 1910's until 1951, when it dropped light trucks to focus on heavy models, Diamond T built a variety of pickups, some rather stylish.
Mack: Known for its heavy trucks and buses, Mack made a half-ton pickup from 1936 through 1938. It was actually manufactured by Reo, with altered trim.
Mercury: Rebadged Ford pickups were sold under the Mercury name in Canada beginning in 1946.
Nash: After World War II, Nash built a three-quarter-ton pickup for export, but some were sold in the United States.
Powell: From 1954-56, the Powell Manufacturing Company in Compton, Calif., made a small pickup based on Plymouth components.
Reo: Best remembered for large trucks and the Reo Speedwagon, the company also made a line of handsome pickups in the 30's and 40's.
