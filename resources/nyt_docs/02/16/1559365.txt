To the Editor:
Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (''A Global Battle's Missing Weapon,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 10) suggest that the ''V'' in Voluntary Counseling and Testing for H.I.V. should be dropped as ''ethnocentric Western rhetoric'' and beside the point. I beg to differ.
I just returned from a visit to Western Province in Kenya, where dark blue signs spelling ''VCT'' in yellow letters are cropping up everywhere. Ten to 15 percent of the population in Western Province is infected with H.I.V., yet there are no free drug treatment programs and private purchase is prohibitive.
Currently, what these centers do offer is rapid testing. What they don't offer is real counseling or treatment. Without the ability to ensure these two essential services, recommended, routine or required testing would miserably fail to offer people anything in return. Surely, in such a setting, the V for voluntary is imperative.
