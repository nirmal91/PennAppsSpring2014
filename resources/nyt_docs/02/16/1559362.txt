To the Editor:
''Why Clark's Campaign, Once Full of Hopes, Fell So Short'' (news article, Feb. 12) correctly quoted me, the Clark campaign's director of communications, as saying that Gen. Wesley K. Clark, at the start of his campaign, was an ''empty vessel.'' This sounds as if I were maligning General Clark, but nothing could be further from the truth.
What I meant is that because he was not a politician with a long line of compromising in his wake, General Clark began this campaign as a blank slate for voters, one that they could fill in as they saw fit.
But once General Clark began to set out his views and his agenda, he did not and could not try to be all things to all people.
Wes Clark is a leader. Leaders make hard choices, and they stick by them. And General Clark did that every day. I couldn't be prouder to have been a part of his team.
