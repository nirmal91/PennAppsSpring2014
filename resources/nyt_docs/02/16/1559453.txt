To the Editor:
Re ''Defending '03 Law, Justice Dept. Seeks Abortion Records'' (front page, Feb. 12):
I'm too old ever to need an abortion, but this situation terrifies me anyway. Naral is right that this ruling will erode patient privacy, to say nothing of putting an additional burden on overworked hospitals blotting out patient names, but it's not the women who have had abortions Attorney General John Ashcroft is after; it's the doctors.
Doctors who perform abortions are already being intimidated, threatened and even killed. Is there any reason to believe that Mr. Ashcroft -- the man whose primary responsibility it is to safeguard the lives of all Americans, regardless of political position or gender -- will protect their lives after their names and affiliations have been made public? And you can bet they will be.
Women got abortions even when it was illegal to do so, but if doctors stop providing the procedure out of fear or intimidation, it won't matter that abortion is legal; women will return to seeking out untrained operations in back alleys, risking injury and death.
