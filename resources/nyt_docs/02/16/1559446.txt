A 3-year-old Brooklyn girl died late Saturday after she was severely beaten, the police said, and her father, who was watching the girl while her mother worked, has been charged with second-degree murder.
Usually when the girl's mother, Michelle Williams, worked the 4-to-midnight shift at the Pathmark on Brooklyn Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, she left Shanice with neighbors down the hall.
Over the weekend, the neighbors were away, so on Saturday, Shanice went with her father, Ronnie Lewis, who lives nearby.
On Saturday evening, the authorities said, Mr. Lewis called 911, explaining that Shanice had vomited and that while cleaning up the vomit he noticed she was unconscious. By midnight, Shanice was dead.
The medical examiner found that she had been beaten so badly her liver was lacerated.
Mr. Lewis, of Bainbridge Street in nearby Stuyvesant Heights, was arrested and charged in the killing yesterday, a law enforcement official said.
Veronica McMeo, Shanice's regular baby sitter in the building on Dean Street near Bedford Avenue, and several other neighbors said Ms. Williams, who is in her 30's, seemed to live in fear of Mr. Lewis.
Ms. McMeo said that while she suspected some sort of trouble, ''I really didn't think there was abuse to that extent.''
Ms. McMeo's 22-year-old daughter, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published, described Shanice as a smart girl who loved to watch ''Sesame Street'' and ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons.
Talking to her was like talking to an adult, she said.
''What the hell could she have done to deserve that?'' Ms. McMeo's daughter said. ''She's a little sweet innocent child.''
Ms. McMeo stood in the doorway of her apartment and cried.
''The child grew up here,'' she said. ''Just that one weekend, when we weren't there, he killed her.''
