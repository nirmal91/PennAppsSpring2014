To the Editor:
Re ''Crimes Most Outlandish, but Why in Germany?'' (Letter From Europe, news article, Feb. 11):
Your article shows a prejudicial view against Germany that still exists in other countries. How can someone judge a country in this way, while in the United States any child can buy a gun from a friendly dealer and then take it to school to kill students and teachers?
Every country has its problems, but Germany seems to be a convenient place to be used to make a point. I am sure all this has to do with the Holocaust. It is a terrible part of our history and we should never forget about it, but it is nearly 60 years since the end of World War II. A few generations have grown up since, which should be enough time to realize that bad things that happen in Germany aren't collectively our fault, nor is it in our genes.
