Teenage girls spend more money on music than boys, and they are also more active digital music users. Teenage boys, perhaps more rebellious, are more apt to download music without paying for it and to make their own CD's.
So says a new report released last week by Jupiter Research, which surveyed more than 1,800 Internet users, ages 13 to 17, about their music-buying habits.
Juliana Deeks, an analyst with Jupiter Research, said teenage girls were more likely to purchase music, both online and in retail stores, spending an average of 15 percent more than teenage boys. They also use the Internet more frequently to find music-related information.
Ms. Deeks said the survey shows that teenage girls are particularly attractive targets for music marketers, which face stiff competition from the ever-wider array of youth entertainment options, like movies, DVD's and video games.
Record company marketers ''are not going to change the size of a kid's allowance,'' she said, ''but they are able to have an influence over where teenagers choose to spend their entertainment dollars.''
