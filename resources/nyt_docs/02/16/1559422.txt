Skiing aggressively to his first slalom victory in two years Sunday, Bode Miller let three top Austrian rivals know that he will race them until the end for the overall World Cup championship this season.
The victory, combined with an eighth-place showing Saturday in the downhill, vaulted him past Stephan Eberharter of Austria in the overall standing. Miller is one of only four racers to score points in all of Alpine skiing's four disciplines.
Miller's weekend put him in striking distance of the Austrians Hermann Maier, who took the overall lead with a downhill victory Saturday, and Benjamin Raich, a slalom and giant slalom specialist who was disqualified after missing a gate.
''I am sticking by my predictions: all four of us have a chance,'' Miller said. ''The finals are going to be exciting.''
No American has won the overall title since Phil Mahre in 1983.
Miller edged Truls Ove Karlsen of Norway by 17-hundredths of a second in the first of two runs. But by the afternoon's final run, the course had softened further and Miller was skiing last.
On the final run, after Kalle Palander of Finland surged into the lead, Miller did make a couple of mistakes, almost falling a few times, but he recovered impressively at the bottom. He picked up time and finished with a combined time of 1 minute 34.60 seconds to beat Palander by almost a second..
