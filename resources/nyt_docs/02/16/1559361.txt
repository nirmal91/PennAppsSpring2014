To the Editor:
Re ''A Police Shooting Revisited'' (editorial, Feb. 12):
It is a welcome departure from the previous administration when the New York Police Department does not blindly defend the department and criticize the victims of a police shooting.
But the Police Department should not prejudge these situations. The commissioner can express profound concern and distress at the killing of a young teenager without prejudging the guilt or innocence of the officer involved.
