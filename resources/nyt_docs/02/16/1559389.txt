The battle for control of Canary Wharf, the London office property built on deserted docklands, shows no sign of cooling. A group of investors headed by Morgan Stanley is exploring the possibility of raising its $3 billion bid for the property and could make a new offer as soon as this week, an executive close to the situation said on Sunday.
On Feb. 12, Brascan, a Toronto property company, said it would raise its bid to match the one made by the Morgan Stanley group. That group plans to sell some of the largest office buildings, and offer a portion of the remaining company to existing shareholders as a new public company. The Brascan group plans to keep the property intact, and has the backing of Canary Wharf founder Paul Reichmann and the fund manager Franklin Mutual.
