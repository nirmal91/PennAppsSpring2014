It seemed a match made in heaven. This month Playboy's Web site began to feature models from SuicideGirls.com, a site of punk-rock pinup girls who are both nude and tattooed.
The arrangement does not involve money, but Playboy gets SuicideGirls.com's independent cachet and young fans while SuicideGirls get its merchandise in the Playboy store and, well, exposure.
Now SuicideGirls has announced plans to start a print magazine, and the relationship may not be so cuddly anymore. The first issue of SG The Magazine will be available to subscribers of the Web site in April, and on newsstands in May. It will begin as a quarterly with a sales goal of 50,000.
The magazine is just the latest offshoot of the Web brand. In January, six of the site's models began the SuicideGirls Live Burlesque Tour. A DVD based on the tour is planned for a fall release, and a coffee table book is due in May.
The company says it has 750,000 unique visitors to its Web site a week. Studios and big record labels (including Warner Brothers) advertise. Perhaps as a nod to advertisers, the magazine will reduce the nudity.
The president of Playboy.com, Randy A. Nicolau, played down the competition in an e-mailed statement, saying, ''SuicideGirls has a targeted alternative audience while Playboy magazine is an American icon.''
SG's editor, Byron Karl, says the magazine will treat the ''girl next door'' concept in a way more likely to appeal to young, urban readers.
''We're going for the girl next door who works in a cool record shop or lives in the Lower East Side,'' he says.
Still, with features in the first issue including the history of punk rock and the worst case of independent-rock metrosexuality -- ''manorexia'' -- there is at least one Playboy standard SG aspires to: Mr. Karl hopes his publication ''will be read for the articles.''
