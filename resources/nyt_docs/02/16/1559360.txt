To the Editor:
If Robert McNamara is able to come to the realization -- decades too late -- that the Vietnam War was a terrible wrong, why must ''conservatives'' attack those who knew it was wrong at the time and acted on their conscience (''Conservatives Shine Spotlight on Kerry's Antiwar Record,'' news article, Feb. 13)?
Mr. Kerry is a double hero for having gone to Vietnam, learned from that experience and then opposed the war -- not to discredit his fellow soldiers, but to save their lives.
