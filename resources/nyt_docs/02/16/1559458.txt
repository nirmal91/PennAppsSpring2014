To the Editor:
In ''The Streets Where History Lives'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 9), Russell Shorto suggests a yellow brick trail, or some similar device, for a walking tour of Lower Manhattan. If the Downtown Alliance does not follow through on Mr. Shorto's plan, he might wish to organize a new association to carry it out.
I lived in New York for 78 of my 80 years and know almost every site that Mr. Shorto mentioned. But if I went back to take a nostalgic walk downtown, having it guided by a colored-brick trail and enhanced by interesting and informative plaques would be a real attraction for me, and I am sure that it would also be helpful to less experienced tourists.
