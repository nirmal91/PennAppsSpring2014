To the Editor:
Does your recent headline ''Romania Declares Victory in Fight Against AIDS'' (front page, Feb. 11) mean that we can all put our concern and checkbooks away and move on? Hardly.
While it is true that Romania is ahead of some poor countries in making triple therapy medications available, that's only a small part of the picture. Romanian children with H.I.V. and AIDS are still much sicker than they should be and are still dying, even when they get their triple therapy drugs on time.
Other essential medications to fight infections, fever and pain are prohibitively expensive or not available. Food, clothing for the harsh Romanian winters, school supplies -- everything is in short supply.
The AIDS crisis is not over anywhere, and least of all in Romania. We can all rejoice that children are, finally, getting regular supplies of their triple therapies. But much more needs to be done.
