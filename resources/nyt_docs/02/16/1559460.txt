To the Editor:
Russell Shorto outlines a wonderful plan to guide visitors to important Lower Manhattan historical sites (Op-Ed, Feb. 9). With numbered markers, perhaps plaques or kiosks, visitors would indeed be able to better learn about the significance of downtown.
Boston has its immensely popular Freedom Trail, and we could have the Liberty Link or Patriot Path. Thousands of visitors would be able to explore downtown's maze of streets without the confusion and frustration that they often experience now.
