To the Editor:
In ''The Streets Where History Lives'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 9), Russell Shorto says Lower Manhattan's past provides important context for the World Trade Center memorial site. He calls for making history more legible within this crowded urban setting by linking the 9/11 memorial, ''Reflecting Absence,'' to a linear sequence of historic sites.
But Mr. Shorto skirts the challenge of his approach: any ''smart selection'' of must-see sites will hide more than it reveals.
No single narrative ''saga'' can encompass the layers of meaning embedded in Lower Manhattan. Likewise, no single iconic image can represent our collective experience of Sept. 11 (hence the power of ''Reflecting Absence'').
Part of the story is always missing. That is another absence to reflect on at ground zero, as we look beyond the empty frame.
