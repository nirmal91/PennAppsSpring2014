To the Editor:
Re ''Regime Thought War Unlikely, Iraqis Tell U.S.'' (front page, Feb. 12):
It seems that beyond having inadequate intelligence about the weapons of mass destruction, we didn't even understand how the Iraqi government thought and functioned. You report that interrogations of captured Iraqi leaders and former officers have ''yielded a portrait of a government disconnected from reality in peace and in war, where members of Mr. Hussein's inner circle routinely lied to him.''
Not knowing what you don't know can be dangerous. Yet it seems we decided we had enough information to start a pre-emptive war when we didn't even have the most basic understanding of what we faced.
Saddam Hussein existed in a world of fantasy, but apparently so do we. That is scary.
