To the Editor:
When Attorney General John Ashcroft refers to ''the rather horrendous practice of partial-birth abortions'' (''Ashcroft Defends Subpoenas,'' news article, Feb. 13), I wonder if he has considered the alternatives.
Expectant parents, who have spent hours and hours excitedly thinking about a new baby, suffer greatly when tests indicate that a fetus will not be viable. Do President Bush and the attorney general plan to offer financial assistance to those parents who will have to bear children who require constant and intrusive care for the few hours or days they might survive? Will they come to my house to wipe my tears as I bury a child missing kidneys I was forced to bear?
I fear that they fail to understand the emotional toll they are exacting on an American public trying our very hardest to care for our children -- even those whom we reluctantly, painfully must choose not to carry to term.
