To the Editor:
In ''The Streets Where History Lives'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 9), Russell Shorto makes a common mistake in looking at the rebuilding of downtown as a Manhattan thing, when it involves the entire metropolitan area.
Yes, talk of the New Amsterdam melting pot warms my heart as an 11th-generation New Yorker, and I am in favor of codifying the accomplishments of the early Dutch settlers. But why restrict a path to the present to the island of Manhattan?
Brooklyn, the Bronx (let's not forget the Danish settlers), Queens, Staten Island, Westchester and that little piece of land to the west (New Jersey) are where the bulk of the Sept. 11 victims were from. New York has never been just Manhattan. Let's reflect that as we move forward.
