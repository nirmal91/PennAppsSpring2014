To the Editor:
I dispute your assertion in ''The Mouse Besieged'' (editorial, Feb. 12) that ''much of the uproar'' created by the Federal Communications Commission's vote to relax ownership rules for media companies ''was orchestrated by local station owners satisfied with the status quo.''
The fact is that Americans -- more than 2.4 million of them -- created the uproar. That is the number of people who sent comments to the F.C.C. on the matter, nearly all of them against more media consolidation. Common Cause alone directed 400,000 messages to members of Congress about the issue.
Americans have no trouble recognizing that when a handful of huge corporations control all of what we see, hear and read, it is a danger to our families, our communities and our democracy.
