The owners of a network of egg farms in northwest Ohio that discharged thousands of tons of ammonia, dung dust and other air pollution each year will install $1.6 million in filters and other pollution controls and pay $880,598 in penalties under a settlement filed in federal court. The company, Buckeye Egg Farm, which produced more than 2.5 billion eggs in 2002, also recently settled a civil suit and is paying neighbors of the chicken warehouses an undisclosed amount.
