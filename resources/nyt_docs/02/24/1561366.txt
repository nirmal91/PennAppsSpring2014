Two-and-a-half-year-old Andrew Cappers yesterday showed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg where his hand, dipped in paint and pressed against a small piece of canvas, had left its mark in memory of his father, James C. Cappers.
Andrew's handprint appears in one of scores of canvas panels now on display at the American Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, in an exhibit of work by children who lost their parents in the Sept. 11 attack and in the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.
The display, which will remain at the museum through May before traveling to schools and art centers around the country, is a therapeutic art project conceived by 16-year-old Ali Millard, who lost her stepfather, Neil D. Levin, in the 2001 attack.
After viewing the collection of panels at the museum - a montage of fire trucks, American flags, rainbows and heartbreaking stick figures in stovepipe hats - Mr. Bloomberg reflected about the work. ''There's nothing more poignant than a child remembering a parent,'' he said, adding, ''You wonder many years from now when they look back what they will remember and what they will think.''
Almost 200 children, from toddlers to teenagers, painted the one-square-foot canvases.
Ms. Millard, whose mother, Christy Ferer, is the mayor's liaison to the families of Sept. 11 victims, said she encouraged children to reflect on memories of their parents, rather than on their deaths. One little girl painted a panel of mountains and streams to remember a summer vacation with her family.
The project, ''Art for Heart,'' was coordinated by the 92nd Street Y and sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Some of the early canvases were displayed for troops in the Middle East, and during the second anniversary event held at the World Trade Center site.
