To the Editor:
Re ''Nader Does It Again'' (editorial, Feb. 23):
Isn't the point of democracy to give the people a choice? The United States sends troops and election monitors to other countries to ensure free elections, but at home we spend taxpayer money to pay judges to hear lawsuits to keep candidates off the ballot.
Stop reproaching candidates who want to offer a choice. If the Democrats had the guts to present an interesting candidate with a difference, they wouldn't be so afraid of a third-party candidate.
No one can spoil the Democrats' chances but themselves.
