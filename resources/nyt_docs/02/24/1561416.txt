To the Editor:
Re ''A Wall as a Weapon,'' by Noam Chomsky (Op-Ed, Feb. 23):
In denouncing Israel's construction of the West Bank security barrier, Mr. Chomsky focuses on the effect the barrier will allegedly have on Palestinians. Perhaps he should focus on the terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians living in the West Bank.
Whatever Mr. Chomsky may think about the legality of the Israeli presence in the West Bank, there is no legal or moral justification for the murder of Israeli civilians, whatever side of the Green Line they may be on. The barrier, a temporary measure, is intended to protect civilians from Palestinian terror pending any final resolution of the conflict.
