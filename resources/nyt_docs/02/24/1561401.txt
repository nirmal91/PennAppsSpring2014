Jury selection began yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the trial of a retired firefighter who is charged with stealing items from ground zero while working as a volunteer after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
The former firefighter, Samuel Brandon, 60, is charged with 11 counts of petty larceny and faces one year in prison on each count if convicted.
According to court papers, an investigator found several items belonging to victims of the attack -- including a photograph of a bride and groom at a wedding reception, seven identification cards belonging to employees of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a two-way radio -- during a search of Mr. Brandon's home in Pine Bush, N.Y., in 2002.
Mr. Brandon was arrested in June 2002.
Court papers quoted a Port Authority detective as saying that Mr. Brandon said that he assisted in the ground zero recovery process on several dates between December 2001 and March 2002 and that he found and removed items from the site.
''During the course of the investigation,'' the detective said, ''the defendant made statements, in substance, that he knew he had no authority and that it was wrong to remove these items from the site, that he had collected other 'souvenirs' from the site, that he had already given some away to family members as gifts, and that the items could be very valuable someday.''
