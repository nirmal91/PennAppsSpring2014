People with diabetes, overwhelmed by the cost of their prescriptions, often skip their medications to save money, two new studies report.
As a result, the researchers said, the patients risk more severe problems, and may end up requiring even more expensive treatment.
In one study, published in Diabetes Care, researchers surveyed patients and found that 11 percent reported having had to cut back on diabetes drugs for financial reasons. The other study, in the journal Medical Care, found that those patients who skipped doses had more health problems.
Both studies were led by Dr. John D. Piette, a Veterans Affairs researcher who teaches medicine at the University of Michigan.
Diabetes patients may be under great pressure to skip doses because they typically take medication for other problems that accompany it, like high blood pressure. In one study, half the patients said they took at least seven prescription drugs, and almost a third reported out-of-pocket costs of $100 or more a month.
But with diabetes, it is especially important that patients' blood sugar levels be kept as steady as possible through regular medication. ''There's really very firm evidence now that tight glycemic control is important to avoid serious complications over the long term,'' Dr. Piette said.
Diabetes drugs were not the only ones skipped to save money. Almost a fifth of the patients in one study said they had cut back on another medication in the previous year, one study found.
The researchers urged doctors to be more aggressive about making sure patients were following their prescription regimens.
One study also found that people on the Veterans Affairs drug plan were least likely to report scaling back on their medicines. People without insurance and those covered by Medicaid or Medicare were much more likely to do so.
