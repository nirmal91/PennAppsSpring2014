The University of Michigan hospital system is trying to overturn a subpoena from the Justice Department demanding records on certain abortion procedures. The Justice Department says that it needs the records to defend a law passed by Congress last year that banned a procedure the law calls partial-birth abortion. But the University of Michigan said in a motion filed in federal court that turning over the records would violate the privacy of its patients.
