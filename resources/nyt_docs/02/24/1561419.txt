To the Editor:
Re ''A Wall as a Weapon,'' by Noam Chomsky (Op-Ed, Feb. 23):
Much as I admire Mr. Chomsky's willingness to note the very real plight of the Palestinians, I wish he would also note the Palestinian refugees' inalienable right of return.
When Mr. Chomsky says that ''few would question Israel's right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks,'' I cannot help but think of the real problem underlying all else -- Israel's definition of citizen.
All Jews are welcome, but no Palestinians are allowed to return. The few Palestinians remaining in Israel proper are constantly harassed by racist land and marriage laws while their cousins in the illegally occupied territories are harassed by Israeli bullets, bombs and bulldozers.
We should be supporting real justice and democracy with full and equal rights for all -- not delusions about security.
