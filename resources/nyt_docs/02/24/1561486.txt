The telecommunications operator France Télécom said it planned to buy back 29.4 percent of its Internet provider, Wanadoo, for 3.95 billion euros ($4.94 billion) in cash and stock. The company is proposing a mixed public offering of seven France Télécom shares and 195 euros ($244) for 40 shares of Wanadoo. It is alternatively proposing an outright buyback for 8.86 euros a share of Wanadoo, a 17.2 percent premium over the closing price on Friday, as well as a share exchange offer of 7 France Télécom shares for every 18 shares of Wanadoo. The company said it aimed to combine voice, data and image services. France Télécom also announced that if the cash-and-share offer is successful, it would float a minority participation in Pages Jaunes, the operator's directory services operation, in the second quarter.
