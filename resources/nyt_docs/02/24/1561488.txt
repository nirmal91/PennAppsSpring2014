Rocket fuel caught on fire and exploded in a building in the Indian space program's main launching center at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, leaving at least three employees hospitalized, officials said. A spokesman for the space program said initial reports that six people had been killed were premature but confirmed that personnel were believed to be trapped in the building. It was not clear how much damage was done to the site.
