To the Editor:
I know that I'm supposed to be carefree about outsourcing (editorial, Feb. 17) because my labor is being freed up for more efficient, high-value uses. Until these uses appear, how do I pay the rent and buy food?
Where does this ''let them eat cake'' mentality come from? We do not live in a country with social services that will see us through a long period of unemployment.
