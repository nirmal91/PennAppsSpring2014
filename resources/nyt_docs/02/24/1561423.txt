To the Editor:
Re ''Why Your Job Isn't Moving to Bangalore,'' by Jagdish Bhagwati (Op-Ed, Feb. 15):
Mr. Bhagwati claims a widespread professional economic consensus that ''the overwhelming cause of wage stagnation in manufacturing has been automation within America, not pressure from cheaper imports.''
Yet in 1995, as the nationwide debate on globalization's impact was intensifying, Mr. Bhagwati told The New York Times, ''You're definitely seeing an enormous integration of the [global] markets and therefore a drag on the real wages here of the semi-skilled, of the computer programmers, of the skilled.''
Apparently even Mr. Bhagwati himself hasn't always found the economists' consensus on globalization convincing.
