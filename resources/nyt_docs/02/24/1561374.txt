Federal prosecutors in Manhattan who had charged a prominent orthodox rabbi with stealing grant money last year said yesterday that they would not prosecute the rabbi, Milton Balkany, who admitted that he was wrong in not complying with specific terms of the grant's use.
Rabbi Balkany, the dean of Bais Yaakov, a Jewish day school in Borough Park, Brooklyn, had been accused of diverting about $700,000 in federal grant money administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The funds were supposed to be used for a school for disabled children.
Instead, according to a statement released by prosecutors, Rabbi Balkany said that the funds were used to pay administrative expenses at the school, the Children's Center of Brooklyn, and at Bais Yaakov. ''Contrary to my understanding with HUD, I authorized the use of the grant to pay for general administrative and operational expenses of both Bais Yaakov and the Children's Center of Brooklyn, even though I knew that the specific terms of the grant did not permit me to use the funds in this manner,'' the rabbi said in the statement, which was released by prosecutors yesterday.
Under the government's terms for avoiding prosecution, Rabbi Balkany must make restitution to HUD, agree to travel restrictions, and engage in ''good behavior'' for six months.
According to a statement to the rabbi from the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, David N. Kelley, and two of his assistants, ''no further prosecution will be instituted in this district for the above offense unless you violate one of the special conditions.''
In August, a criminal complaint accused the rabbi of using the money to pay for life insurance premiums, income taxes, electronics and restaurant bills, among other things. He was charged with theft of government property, false claims, and wire fraud and obstruction.
