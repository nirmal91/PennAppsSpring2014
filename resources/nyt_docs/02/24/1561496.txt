The Legislature has passed a bill making lethal injection the only form of execution in the state. If the measure is signed by Gov. Olene S. Walker, death row inmates will no longer be able to choose execution by a firing squad. The law, which passed last week, would not affect the four men now on Utah's death row who have already selected death by firing squad.
