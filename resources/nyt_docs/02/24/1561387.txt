Gov. George E. Pataki, who leads the most indebted state in the nation, is to be co-host of a fund-raiser in Manhattan tonight to help Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, the second most indebted state, persuade his state to borrow more money.
The invitations for the event solicited half-million-dollar contributions, and individual seats went for $50,000, making it the most expensive fund-raiser that several campaign finance experts said they could recall. The money will pay for a campaign to urge California voters to approve the sale of $15 billion worth of bonds.
The party will be held overlooking Central Park, in the apartment of Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets.
Mr. Schwarzenegger inherited a sea of red ink when he took office this year -- it was one of the key issues that led Californians to recall his predecessor, Gray Davis -- and he has been an outspoken critic of higher taxes. So he is looking to borrow $15 billion, pushing the cost of some current services to future taxpayers.
The borrowing plan will be put before California voters next Tuesday, along with a measure to require the state to balance future budgets.
In turning to Mr. Pataki for help, Mr. Schwarzenegger is tapping a fellow Republican who has also turned to borrowing to tide his state over.
At the end of last year, New York was just under $46 billion in debt, making it the most indebted state in the nation in terms of absolute dollars, according to Moody's Investors Service. California was the runner-up, with $37.6 billion in debt.
If the bond sale is approved, California will surpass New York in debt.
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said, ''Governor Pataki believes that Governor Schwarzenegger is poised to help California overcome the challenges it faces, and he looks forward to welcoming the governor to New York.''
