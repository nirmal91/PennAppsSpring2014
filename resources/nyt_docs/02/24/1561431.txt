To the Editor:
Just what is it about Ralph Nader's run for the presidency that has the Democratic establishment apoplectic (front page, Feb. 23)? Is it that voters will hear Mr. Nader's message and decide that they prefer it to the Democratic candidate's?
And exactly what is wrong with voters deciding that they prefer the unbought Nader to the corporate stooges he will compete against?
