The largest supermarket company in Australia, Woolworths, said that its net profit in the six months ended Jan. 11 rose 12.9 percent, to 420 million Australian dollars ($323.5 million), as sales rose 6.4 percent, to 15.05 billion Australian dollars. Woolworths is battling Coles Myer for shoppers by cutting prices for gasoline at its filling stations. Woolworths has aligned with a ChevronTexaco subsidiary, Caltex Australia, to invest in gas stations, while Coles Myer has teamed with Shell Australia.
