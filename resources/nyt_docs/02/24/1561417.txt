To the Editor:
Re ''A Wall as a Weapon,'' by Noam Chomsky (Op-Ed, Feb. 23):
The stark reality is that while Israel continues to build its ''security fence,'' at the same time it partakes in covert attempts at geographical expansion. Yet no one cares to read between the lines when Israel claims that its actions are self-defense mechanisms aimed at protecting Israeli citizens.
In the end, as Mr. Chomsky notes, a solution to the Israel-Palestine problem will be achieved only through American determination and resolve. That determination and resolve will not be found in a Bush administration so closely allied with the Christian right. Only a bold and courageous leader who is not afraid to speak the truth will be able to bring peace to the Middle East. Such a bold leader will probably not emerge any time soon.
