The Chinese government announced Monday that it had approved the import of genetically modified crops, a victory for the American biotech industry that will make it easier for the United States to export more food to China.
But the decision is also a setback for environmentalist groups like Greenpeace, which describe such crops as ''frankenfoods,'' and had sought to dissuade China to restrict their use in the world's largest market for soybeans and one of the largest for other crops.
The Agriculture Ministry said in a statement that it had granted safety certificates for five of seven crops submitted by Monsanto -- a soybean variety, two kinds of corn and two kinds of cotton.
Phil Laney, the China director of the American Soybean Association, said China was approving crops that had been approved in the United States since the late 1990's. ''This will make trade flow more smoothly and our customers will be able to plan their shipments better,'' he said.
Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman and Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, issued a joint statement in Washington saying the Chinese decision showed Beijing's willingness to abide by commitments to the World Trade Organization. They said the approval of the Monsanto products would help American exports, with China already buying more than a third of American soybean exports.
Sze Pang-cheung, the Greenpeace campaign manager in China for genetic modification issues, said that while Beijing only approved the import of the crops and not the planting of them, Greenpeace was worried that some of the imported crops would end up being planted anyway.
Mr. Sze said he was encouraged, however, that Chinese officials have recently voiced support for strict international safety standards for genetically modified crops.
The New China News Agency said that 18 more applications had been submitted, and that 11 of those, from American, German and Swiss companies, were already being processed.
