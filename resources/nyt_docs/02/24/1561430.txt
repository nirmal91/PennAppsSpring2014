To the Editor:
I can't be comforted by your view that Ralph Nader's entry into the 2004 presidential race will have more of an effect on his legacy than on the election (editorial, Feb. 23).
We are at a turning point in American history, faced with great challenges here and abroad. And a narrow majority, with rigid party discipline, is shutting out half the country.
The last two years should help us see the future under a Republican government. The vote for president this November is too important a choice to be made while distracted by a Nader candidacy.
Mr. Nader comes from a far-sighted reform tradition of vision, courage and selflessness. Let's hope that he finds those values again.
