Patients who have had surgery to remove skin cancers report being more likely to use sun protection than they had been before the surgery, researchers say.
The researchers, led by Dr. John S. Rhee of the Medical College of Wisconsin, interviewed more than 100 patients before skin cancer surgery and one and four months after. The patients had nonmelanoma skin cancer, which is generally not fatal. More than a million new cases are diagnosed in Americans each year, the study said.
Before surgery, the researchers found, 49 percent of the patients reported using sunscreen. The figure grew to 72 percent afterward. The number of people who wore hats to shield themselves from the sun also grew. Many patients also said they had started avoiding the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., according to the study, published in the current Archives of Otolaryngology.
How long the changes in behavior last, of course, is an open question. Dr. Rhee said it would be interesting to interview the patients a year or two later.
In a second study, published in The Archives of Dermatology, Danish researchers asked 285 volunteers to wear wristwatches equipped with gauges called dosimeters to measure how much radiation they received from the sun. The gauges ''time stamped'' the readings to help researchers determine where subjects were at the times of highest exposures.
Among the findings was that teenagers had much more sun exposure than young children. ''An explanation could be that small children instinctively avoid the sun,'' the authors wrote, ''while adolescents may want to be get tanned.''
The study also found that people -- other than gardeners -- received most of their sun on their days off.
