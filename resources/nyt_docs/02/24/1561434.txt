To the Editor:
Where has Ralph Nader been? If he still believes that there is too little difference between the two parties after what the Bush administration has perpetrated here and abroad in the last three years, then he is not politically savvy enough or observant enough to warrant our consideration for the presidency (front page, Feb. 23).
Ralph Nader is the perfect answer to a question that no one is asking.
