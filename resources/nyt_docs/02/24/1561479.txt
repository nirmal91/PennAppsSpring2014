To the Editor:
For effect, NASA insists on ''geomorphing'' features on Mars (''With Close-Ups of Mars''). It refers to the stones embedded in Martian rocks, for example, as ''blueberries.''
What we need are Martian terms, not terrestrial ones, although the latter, as the article points out, make the forbidding planet seem more homey. Maybe this in turn makes the agency's budget seem more palatable.
