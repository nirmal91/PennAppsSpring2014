To the Editor:
Like Noam Chomsky (Op-Ed, Feb. 23) and many American Jews, I, too, would prefer that the Israeli security fence be built along the 1967 border. But if I have to make the unhappy choice between supporting a barrier that appropriates Palestinian land and a porous border that allows terrorists to bomb buses and cafes, I choose almost any barrier.
No wall, however monstrous, could ever rise to the lunatic peaks of suicide barbarism. It's time we stop apologizing for it.
