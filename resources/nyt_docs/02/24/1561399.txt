The New York Times appointed two executives to new positions yesterday.
Marc Z. Kramer, senior vice president for production, was named senior vice president for circulation. And Thomas P. Lombardo, executive director for production and plant manager at the company's printing and distribution operation in College Point, Queens, was named vice president for production.
The appointments were announced by Scott H. Heekin-Canedy, president and general manager of The Times.
Mr. Kramer, 48, will continue to oversee production and labor relations, as he has done since 1999. He joined The Times in 1998 as vice president for labor relations and took over additional responsibility for production the next year. He became a senior vice president in 2001.
Mr. Kramer began his law career as a staff lawyer in the labor department of the New York City Board of Education and later served as general counsel at the Mayor's Office of Labor Relations. From 1990 to 1993, he was a labor associate at Proskauer Rose, the New York law firm. He then joined The Daily News, where he had responsibility for labor relations as vice president and general counsel.
Mr. Lombardo, 50, has managed the Queens plant since 1996 and has been executive director of production since 1999.
He joined The Times in 1976 and became delivery foreman a year later. He was assistant manager at the company's plant in Carlstadt, N.J., from 1983 to 1987 and plant manager in Carlstadt from 1987 to 1992. He subsequently held posts including construction manager and group director of production facilities.
