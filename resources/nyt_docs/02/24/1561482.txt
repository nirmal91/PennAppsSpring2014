To the Editor:
Re ''Surviving the Healing During a Hospital Stay'' (Feb. 17): My elderly mother witnessed all of the following during a recent hospital stay: nurses ignoring patients' calls for assistance, nurses not properly reading charts and patients being kept in bed when they should be up and about.
The most important antidote to these problems was for me to be in my mother's room as much as possible.
Also important were surprise visits. When the medical staff did not know when I'd appear to check on my mother, they tended to be more attentive.
