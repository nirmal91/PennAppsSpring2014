Many people with asthma who take pains to avoid substances or situations that may set off attacks may overlook a potential danger in their medicine cabinets, aspirin.
Writing in the current issue of BMJ, a British medical journal, researchers say about one adult asthmatic in five can suffer a potentially life-threatening reaction to aspirin. For children with asthma, the rate is 1 in 20.
The prevalence is higher than previously suggested, the researchers said. Although most people with asthma can safely take the pain reliever acetaminophen, the drug found in Tylenol, most were also sensitive to pain relievers like ibuprofen.
The researchers, led by Dr. Christine Jenkins of Royal Prince Albert Hospital in Camperdown, Australia, said doctors who treat asthma patients should make sure they know how their bodies will react. If they have to take aspirin or drugs like ibuprofen and it is uncertain whether they will have a bad reaction, the study said, the medications should be tested under medical supervision.
The findings were based on a review of 21 studies.
