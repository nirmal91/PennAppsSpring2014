An article on Saturday about Democrats' appeals to Ralph Nader to refrain from seeking the presidency, a run they said could help re-elect President Bush, truncated the title of a book by one such Democrat, Mark Green, and omitted the name of his co-author. The title is ''The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)Leads America'' (Viking Penguin, 2004). The co-author was Eric Alterman.
