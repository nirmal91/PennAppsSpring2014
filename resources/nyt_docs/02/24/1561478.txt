To the Editor:
Re ''With Close-Ups of Mars, the Mystery Gets Lost in Space'' (Feb. 17): I agree, as the article points out, that the rover images from Mars have become almost routine.
So why not instruct the cameras on board the Spirit and the Opportunity to take some night shots of Earth and the Moon? In the Martian night sky, our home planet would be a spectacular sight, more brilliant than Venus as seen from Earth; and the Moon should be large enough to be seen by an astronaut on Mars with his or her naked eye.
A photo of the two would be as memorable as the famous ''Earthrise'' photo taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts orbiting the Moon in 1968.
