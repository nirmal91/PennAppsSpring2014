Sinus Problems
Q.  My mother said her mother used to have the druggist drain her infected sinuses with a tube. Could this possibly be true?
A.  Depending on how long ago it was and in what neighborhood, it could easily be true. Michael R. Harris, a pharmacist and historian for the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum, said he had heard of druggists' doing the procedure long ago in Brooklyn.
''Many pharmacists did treat patients 'in the back room,' where they had a small office and gave vitamin shots, lanced boils and did other medical procedures, all violations,'' Mr. Harris said. ''The older population didn't want to go to the hospital, because 'that's where you die,' and it was easy to get sucked in to help someone.''
In poor neighborhoods or those with large immigrant populations, such traditions persisted well into the 20th century. Mr. Harris said his Lithuanian grandfather had an arterial aneurysm repaired by a pharmacist.
Dr. Greg Higby, director of the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy, agreed that pharmacists often performed small medical procedures, but pointed out that sinus drainage would be particularly risky, because the sinuses are so close to the brain, the passages are so small, and the tissues so delicate. Sinus drainage is now usually performed as surgery just by doctors.
''It's serious stuff now,'' Dr. Higby said. ''Not something you want to fool around with in the back of the drugstore.''
