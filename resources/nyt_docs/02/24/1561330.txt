Re ''Amid Iraq-Bound National Guard, Bush Acts to Blunt Foes' Barbs'' (news article, Feb. 18):
The debate over George W. Bush's record in the Guard brings the situation faced by today's citizen soldiers to the forefront. My boyfriend's Army Reserve unit was activated more than a year ago. It has not yet completed its 12 months on the ground in Kuwait and Iraq. But I was appalled to learn that already discussions are under way about redeploying the unit in late 2004 or early 2005.
In what sense are these soldiers ''reservists''? This is an active duty schedule. These men and women cannot possibly maintain civilian careers under such conditions.
Is this a way of instituting a draft without submitting the matter for public debate -- to press our reservists and guardsmen into full-time service by destroying their civilian lives?
