An infant boy was found abandoned in a stairwell in a Manhattan building yesterday, the police said. The baby, who the police said was healthy and appeared to be between 1 and 5 days old, had been wrapped in a blanket and placed inside a black handbag before workers discovered him at 10:27 a.m., the police said. The baby had been left in a third-floor stairwell at 127 West 127th Street, the police said. Katrina Gray, an employee of Northern Manhattan Perinatal Partnership, an organization whose office is near where the infant was found, told WABC-TV that workers discovered the child 10 minutes after they found the handbag. The baby was taken to Harlem Hospital Center, the police said.
