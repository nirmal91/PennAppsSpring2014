To the Editor:
Re ''Ralph Nader Does It Again'' (editorial, Feb. 23):
Ralph Nader's bid for president seems to be a purely idealistic one. He knows that he won't be elected, but he wants to make his point. In the last election, that helped elect a president whose policies are very divergent from his own.
If Mr. Nader truly wants to help Americans, he should look for realistic ways to do so, like linking up with a candidate who, if elected, could put his ideas to use.
Idealism is a good thing, but the reality and importance of a presidential election and its outcome are what we will be living with for the next four years.
