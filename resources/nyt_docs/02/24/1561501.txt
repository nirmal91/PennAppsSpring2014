Carl C. Icahn, the Wall Street financier, has pledged $25 million for advanced medical research to Mount Sinai Medical Center, the third-largest gift in its history, hospital officials said yesterday. Mount Sinai will name its main medical school and research building, at Madison Avenue and East 98th Street, after Mr. Icahn. Most research grants are directed at particular diseases, but Mr. Icahn, a Mount Sinai trustee, put no limits on his gift, which will be made over five years. That means it can support basic research that will lead to other projects and grants, Peter W. May, Mount Sinai's chairman, and Kenneth Davis, president and dean of the medical school, said. ''It's equity money that can be used to seed projects that are not yet ready for formal funding,'' Mr. May said. They said the money would go toward, among other things, research on vaccines, gene therapies and stem cells.
