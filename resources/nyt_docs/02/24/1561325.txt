The pianist Bruce Barth brought a lot of resources to the bandstand at the Up Over Jazz Caf√© on Friday. There were impressive original ballads; a piece that got accurately into the mechanics of a particular Brazilian rhythm; playful, high-speed, jagged originals; quickly changing tempos; and tight arrangements for his trio, which included the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Montez Coleman.
Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine if overlooked records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like.
He is basically a moderate, organized player: he swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brought a degree of percussive aggression to the music that sounded even more powerful inside these boundaries. Shortly after the first set began, by the third chorus of his own piece, ''Little Ditty,'' he was stamping his left foot, locking into a groove with the drummer and hammering the keyboard.
Small groups like piano trios depend so much upon the immediate links between musicians, and Mr. Barth has a special connection with his drummer.
Mr. Coleman can play rudimentary material -- strolling, rolling on the snare or snaping it to close off a four-bar segment -- with a delicacy and power that make you feel its weight, and Mr. Barth experimented with lagging behind his tempo. On ''Wilsonian Alto'' they played in Brazilian partido-alto rhythm, finding its difficult pocket of swing.
Two slow, ambitious pieces came from Mr. Barth's recent album ''East and West'' (MaxJazz), inspired by memories of seeing ghost towns in California during his childhood.
''At the Ranch'' and ''Sundown Time'' had humor and a bucolic American sweep; there were bits of cowboy songs, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Thelonious Monk mixed together in them.
