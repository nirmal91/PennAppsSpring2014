A New York City police detective, one of a handful of detectives assigned to gather information on terrorism in foreign countries, was promoted yesterday, the Police Department announced. The detective, Mordecai Dzikansky, was elevated to detective first grade, the department's highest rank for a detective. Detective Dzikansky, who recently returned from Moscow, where he observed a subway bombing investigation, had ''responded to incidents worldwide to improve the New York Police Department's understanding of and capacity to prevent suicide bombings and other attacks,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement yesterday. Detective Dzikansky, 41, who has also studied bombings in Turkey, is the department's liaison to the Israel National Police, the department said.
