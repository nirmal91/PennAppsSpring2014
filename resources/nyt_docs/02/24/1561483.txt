To the Editor:
One important tool for surviving a hospital stay, as I have learned from experience, is a sense of humor (''Surviving the Healing'').
Another is having an advocate to deal with the medical staff. When I was recently in the hospital, my husband, a law professor, was there to ask all the right questions.
It is also important to be courteous and kind to the people providing care. When my daughter called the nursing station looking for her dad one day, she described him as a ''bald-headed man who is probably being very nice to you.''
They immediately knew whom she was talking about.
