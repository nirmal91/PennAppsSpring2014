To the Editor:
Discussion of whether outsourcing of jobs offshore will be good or bad for the United States economy (editorial, Feb. 17) has so far ignored a crucial factor: the resource in question, human labor -- whether at the low or high end of the pay scale -- is in vastly greater supply in countries like China and India than here at home.
When economists project that in years to come the living standards in those countries will rise such that there will be little economic advantage in outsourcing, they are deluding themselves. Their wages will not rise to approximate ours; ours will plummet to try to compete with theirs.
To that, add projections of three billion more people on the planet by 2050, the overwhelming majority in less developed nations, and the consequences of letting American jobs go overseas are dire indeed. In the face of out-of-control global population growth, our leaders have no choice but to protect our own workers.
