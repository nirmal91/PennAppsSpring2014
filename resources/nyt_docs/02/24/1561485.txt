The Changan Ford Automobile Corporation, the venture of the Ford Motor Company with the Changan Group of Chongqing, said that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to obtain the land use rights for construction of a plant in Nanjing, 142 miles northwest of Shanghai. Changan Ford said that it would decide later what model would be built at the plant, declining to confirm expectations that the Ford Focus compact car would be chosen. The venture already makes the Fiesta and the Mondeo at a plant in Chongqing, 800 miles up the Yangtze River from Shanghai; the new factory will make it easier to sell cars in affluent coastal areas.
