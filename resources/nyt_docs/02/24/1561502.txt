Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was forced to cancel a day of events yesterday because of a dental emergency. Her schedule included a speech before the state's mayors about problems regarding the distribution of Homeland Security money. Senator Clinton had to undergo emergency dental surgery yesterday morning, said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman. In addition to being the scheduled keynote speaker at the annual Conference of Mayors, Senator Clinton had planned to participate in a ceremony with veterans celebrating the 59th anniversary of the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima, speak at another event about alternative energy and visit a local food bank. Instead, she underwent surgery in the morning in New York and returned to Washington in the afternoon.
