To the Editor:
At a time when the focus must be a Democratic ticket that is strong and has the full backing of everyone who wishes to see the Bush administration go down to a roaring defeat, it is disheartening that Ralph Nader has decided to enter the 2004 presidential race (front page, Feb. 23).
Mr. Nader is a man with specific principles and agendas who could serve his country more effectively by putting aside his egomania and giving his support where it is needed most.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he attended the Democratic convention and said, ''Here I am; what can I do to make a real difference?''
