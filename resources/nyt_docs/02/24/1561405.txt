PeopleSoft Inc. said on Monday that it mailed proxy materials to its shareholders in preparation for its annual meeting next month, strongly urging them to reject a hostile takeover offer from Oracle and to support its slate of nominees to the PeopleSoft board.
In a letter to shareholders, Craig A. Conway, the chief executive of PeopleSoft, said that Oracle's $26 a share bid is an attempt to damage the company and deny its stockholders full value.
Oracle has submitted its own slate of nominees to the PeopleSoft board in an effort to take control of the company and push through approval of its $9.4 billion tender offer for PeopleSoft, its competitor in the business software market.
But prospects for the bid from Oracle could take a decisive turn well before the PeopleSoft's shareholders meeting, which is scheduled for March 25.  The Justice Department is expected to make a final decision by March 2 and perhaps as early as this week on whether it will block the proposed takeover on antitrust grounds.
PeopleSoft announced two weeks ago that it had been informed by the Justice Department that staff lawyers there had recommended to R. Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general for antitrust, that the agency reject the takeover.
The European Commission, which has just resumed its antitrust review of the merger, is expected to issue its decision in the next few weeks.
Oracle executives are presenting final arguments this week in what will be the company's last meeting with Mr. Pate before he issues his decision, said Jim Finn, an Oracle spokesman.
That decision will depend on whether Mr. Pate agrees with how his staff lawyers have defined the market for business enterprise software, which is typically sold in collections, or suites.
Oracle says the market is highly competitive with many smaller companies providing specific elements.
The Justice Department's lawyers, however, are arguing that if the Oracle-PeopleSoft merger goes through, the business software market will essentially be reduced from three big competitors -- SAP of Germany, Oracle and PeopleSoft -- to two, with resulting harm to customers.
PeopleSoft's four board nominees are all currently on the company's board, including Mr. Conway. ''This board has clearly demonstrated their commitment to you by rejecting Oracle's offers, which undervalue PeopleSoft and are likely to be prohibited under antitrust law,'' Mr. Conway wrote in his letter.
Mr. Conway said that Oracle's slate of ''hand picked'' nominees were not interested in protecting PeopleSoft shareholders. ''Consider this,'' he said. ''When Oracle's paid nominees all agreed to be nominated, Oracle was only offering $19.50 per share for your stock. Oracle now says you should trust Oracle's nominees to look out for your interests.''
Shares of Oracle fell 37 cents, to close at $13.34. Shares of PeopleSoft fell 60 cents, to $21.60.
Last week, Oracle issued a letter to PeopleSoft shareholders urging them to tender their shares, calling the all-cash offer a ''compelling value.'' Oracle's latest offer, which it said was final, expires on March 12. But analysts say PeopleSoft shareholders will have little incentive to tender their shares before a Justice Department decision is announced.
''At $26 a share, that could be enough to get shareholders to tender,'' said David M. Hilal, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey &amp; Company. ''But there's no urgency. The ultimate decision is with the Justice Department.''
