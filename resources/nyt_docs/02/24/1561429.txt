A foot injury suffered in last Tuesday night's performance of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' has forced Ashley Judd out of the Broadway production, casting doubt over the future of the revival at the Music Box Theater. The show, also starring Ned Beatty and Jason Patric, is to play three more weeks. Ms. Judd, one of the drama's major draws, will be replaced by her understudy, Kelly McAndrew. Discussing the show's future, a producer, Bill Kenwright, said, ''It is my intention to certainly perform this week and my hope that we can continue the run.'' Ms. Judd, who played the long-suffering wife, Maggie, tore a ligament in Act I in a scene that called for her to jump off a bed. Instead of landing on her feet, she fell awkwardly and tore a ligament. Citing great pain and discomfort, she left after the second act and was replaced by Ms. McAndrew in Act III. Ms. Judd missed the Wednesday matinee and Thursday evening performances, but against the advice of her doctors soldiered through all of the weekend performances except the Saturday matinee. Yesterday it was announced that Ms. Judd could not continue and would undergo surgery tomorrow. ''Cat'' received mixed reviews when it opened last October but achieved box-office success, earning around $500,000 a week for most of its run until the post-holiday slump, when the show, like many on Broadway, suffered a drop in sales.
