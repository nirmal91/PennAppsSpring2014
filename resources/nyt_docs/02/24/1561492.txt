The California attorney general, Bill Lockyer, announced Monday night that he would ask the state Supreme Court to intervene in the legal battle over same-sex marriages in San Francisco.
Mr. Lockyer, who has been under increasing pressure from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other elected officials to bring a halt to the marriages, said he would file papers with the court by Friday.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lockyer said the attorney general's office, in consultation with Mr. Schwarzenegger's legal staff, was responding to a lawsuit filed against the state on Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court by the city of San Francisco.
''Immediate action by the highest state court is necessary because this is a matter of statewide concern and urgency,'' a statement issued by his office said.
The statement said the Supreme Court had the legal authority to stop the city, which has issued more than 3,200 licenses since Feb. 12.
''The people of California who have enacted laws that recognize marriage only between a man and a woman, and the same-sex couples who were provided marriage licenses in San Francisco deserve a speedy resolution to the question of the legality of these licenses,'' Mr.Lockyer said.
In its lawsuit, San Francisco asserted that the state's family code, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, violates the state Constitution. It was the same argument made by Mayor Gavin Newsom on Feb. 12 when he issued a directive recognizing same-sex marriages.
The Lockyer spokeswoman, Hallye Jordan, said Mr. Lockyer was turning the Supreme Court in the hope of expediting the legal battle with the city and bringing an end to the same-sex marriages as soon as possible.
''It was determined the fastest and best way was to go straight to the Supreme Court,'' Ms. Jordan said.
City officials have said they are prepared for the legal battle, insisting the law is on their side.
