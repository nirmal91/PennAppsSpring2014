To the Editor:
Re ''2 Friends, 242 Eggs and a Breakthrough'' (Feb. 17): I've long been troubled by private ownership of general knowledge like patents on the human genome.
That is why I am impressed by Dr. Woo Suk Hwang and Dr. Shin Yong Moon's decision to refuse patent rights on their method for creating viable stem cells through cloning.
I am also heartened by their decision to remain in the university setting. Anyone who cares to look will find that the publication rates of researchers who move to private companies plunges. I hope the Korean government realizes what an asset they have in these two men and will support further work by them.
