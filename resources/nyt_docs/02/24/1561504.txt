NYC TV, the municipal government's network of five cable channels, which is less than a year old, has received four New York Emmy award nominations. Last year, the city decided to improve its dry and, critics said, nearly unwatchable programming known as Crosswalks Television. The new network, available to 1.8 million cable subscribers in the five boroughs, has been nominated for best promotional announcements, best public service announcements, best on-camera achievement (for Julie Laipply, who is host of a program on inexpensive things to do in the city) and best research. The New York Emmys will be held on March 28 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
