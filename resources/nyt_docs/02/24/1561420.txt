To the Editor:
Noam Chomsky says a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict ''could be enacted immediately if Washington wanted to do so'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 23).
I would remind Mr. Chomsky that President Clinton and Prime Minister Ehud Barak tried very hard in 2000 to achieve just such a solution, and Yasir Arafat rejected the deal.
