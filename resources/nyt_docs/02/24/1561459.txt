A chart in Business Day on Friday listing the former executives of Enron who have been indicted or pleaded guilty to various financial crimes referred incorrectly to charges against two former executives of Enron's broadband division, Kevin A. Howard and Michael W. Krautz. (The error also appeared in a similar chart on Jan. 8.) While the two men have been charged with fraud and conspiracy, they have not been charged with insider trading.
