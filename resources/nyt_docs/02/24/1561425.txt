To the Editor:
Re ''Nader, Gadfly to the Democrats, Will Again Run for President'' (front page, Feb. 23):
Ralph Nader's last campaign probably helped George W. Bush win the White House. A Nader candidacy will probably repeat his performance of 2000, and draw votes away from the Democratic candidate.
Mr. Nader is right when he says he offers American voters more choices. But he should ask himself -- considering his own criticism of President Bush -- if more choice alone is what American voters want or need.
