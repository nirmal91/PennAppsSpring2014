To the Editor:
Re ''From Space, a New View of Doomsday'' (Feb. 17): Contrary to the notion that the universe may expand forever and end in darkness or that all matter might be blown apart by a mysterious dark energy, there exists the possibility that the universe is rotating like planets, galaxies and superclusters and will exist indefinitely at a stable, finite size.
Thus, the mysterious antigravity force may be none other than the centrifugal force that keeps the Moon from falling and satellites in their orbits.
