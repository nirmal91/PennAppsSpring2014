The avian flu detected on a chicken farm near San Antonio is a strain far more deadly to chickens than initially diagnosed and has been found in a live poultry market in Houston where birds from the farm are routinely sent, health officials said. More than 6,600 chickens on the San Antonio farm and about 20 ducks at the Houston market were destroyed, the Agriculture Department said. Health officials said the strain posed no serious threat to humans.
