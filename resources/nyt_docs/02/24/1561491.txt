President Bush's new global AIDS coordinator, Randall L. Tobias, announced the release of the first share of aid -- $350 million to finance antiretroviral treatment for 50,000 AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa -- as he gave a five-year, $15-billion plan to Congress. He said the initial outlays would focus on 14 or 15 nations where infection rates were highest. Mr. Tobias said the global AIDS initiative, which Mr. Bush presented in his State of the Union address last year, would eventually provide treatment for two million H.I.V.-infected people. Under the plan, $9 billion of the $15 billion will be directed to 12 African countries -- Botswana, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia -- and 2 in the Western Hemisphere: Haiti and Guyana. Another nation will be announced later, officials said.
