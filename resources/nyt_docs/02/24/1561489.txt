Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, was barred as a candidate in elections next month in the Provence-Alps-Riviera region because he failed to prove that he lives in the region and pays local taxes. He lives in Paris. Mr. Le Pen, 75, sent shock waves through the country in 2002, when he came in second in the presidential election.
