The American Psychological Association is joining the debate on the potentially harmful effects of advertising on children by recommending that the government restrict marketing to those younger than 7 or 8 because they are unable ''to recognize advertising's persuasive intent.''
The primary conclusion of a report released last night by a task force on advertising and children, formed by the association in 2000, is that such advertising is ''inherently unfair'' because children younger than 7 or 8 ''comprehend the information contained in television commercials uncritically, accepting most advertising claims and appeals as truthful, accurate and unbiased.''
Richard O'Brien, executive vice president at the Washington office of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, criticized the report, calling it ''stunning in its disregard for the 40 years of diligence and effort that the advertising industry has put into protecting the special sensibilities of children.''
The advertising industry has a self-regulatory process for children's advertising as well as general advertising, involving the Council of Better Business Bureaus; in instances when advertisers refuse to satisfactorily resolve complaints, they are referred to the Federal Trade Commission. However, the rising tide of advertising aimed at children, fed by the growth of media like cable television that can more precisely aim ads at them, has fueled more calls for limits.
