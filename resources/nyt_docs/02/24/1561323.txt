To the Editor:
Re ''Captive Audience 30,000 Feet in the Air'' (On the Road column, Business Day, Feb. 17):
Air travelers are captive audiences not only to flight-crew entertainment but also to corporate promotion masquerading as safety information.
On a recent United Air Lines flight, the instructional videos were slathered with pumped-up iconic theme music, logos, slick graphics and glorious shots of sun rays and clouds.
We used to see live flight attendants demonstrating the operation of real oxygen masks and seat belts. Now we see the apparatus on camera in the hands of smile-crazed models who are so buff and beautiful they could pass for television news anchors.
The subtext speaks chiefly to corporate image and very little to safety.
