To the Editor:
Regarding ''To Preserve a Store's Future, Turning to Its Past,'' Feb. 1: After using every possible ''technique'' and failing to stop the building of a minor league baseball park in downtown Yonkers, including trumping the race card and legal, environmental and social issues, property owners now turn to the absurdity of ''historic preservation.''
I am convinced that the only reason why a small number of businesses continue to fight the city's plans is as a ''bargaining chip'' to increase the amount of money that they will receive when the city condemns their properties.
The city has assured these storeowners that they will be relocated and properly compensated.
The new ballpark will bring in additional tax revenues to a city that desperately needs them, jobs for area residents, a stadium that will be able to be used by the community and school groups, as well as the minor league team, and an ''uplift'' to an area that sorely needs it.
Drive down New Main Street through the area any day of the week and you will see why the proposed development is needed in the area.
The Getty Square that my grandfather used to drive the No.1 trolley through (before my time) cannot meet the needs of our area residents today.
Ballparks have revitalized communities in Connecticut and Brooklyn, and hopefully will do the same for Getty Square in Yonkers!
