The Republican-dominated City Council in Long Beach has appointed a new city manager, making its biggest move since ousting an entrenched Democratic city government in November's elections.
Taking over the day-to-day management of the city is Glen Spiritis, a lifelong Long Beach resident. He replaces Harold Porr, who had held the $150,000 post since May 2002.
Mr. Spiritis, 51, served as Long Beach's deputy city manager and director of planning and development from 1979 to 1986. For the last 13 years, he has been the commissioner of community development for the Village of Hempstead, another municipality with a Republican government and a Democratic voting majority.
''My first goal will be to put the city on a stable financial foundation,'' he said, alluding to a municipal debt of almost $10 million. his other priorities, he said, are stabilizing taxes, implementing a beach-erosion project, reopening the pool at the city's recreation center and planning development, including the Superblock, the largest vacant waterfront property in Long Beach.
''I will be meeting with the developers of the Superblock to discuss the proposed project,'' he said. ''We are not against development -- just against overdevelopment.''

IN BRIEF  Correction:  February 15, 2004, Sunday  Because of an editing error, a brief article last Sunday about the naming of a city manager in Long Beach referred imprecisely to the salary of the appointee, Glen Spiritis. It is $150,000; during the tenure of his predecessor, Harold Porr, it was $130,000.
