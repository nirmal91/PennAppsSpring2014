To the Editor:
In his review of ''In My Father's Footsteps'' (Jan. 18), a memoir by Sebastian Matthews about the poet William Matthews, Stephen Burt seems to give short shrift to Bill Matthews the man. I must be one of the few female students Matthews was attracted to who never went to bed with him: I knew him as a Teacher, cap ''T.'' True, he was a member of a dying breed -- the old school of academic male poets -- but to disparage Matthews as a mere example of a lifestyle is to miss the great Horatian virtue he embodied: that of civility, which entailed the lost art of conversing.
Wise, witty and infinitely humane (connoting human and urbane), Matthews possessed a kind of emotional intelligence that could cut through pretension -- as in his reply to my student question when we first encountered each other, at a poetry conference circa 1977: ''Why did you start writing poetry?'' (which he admitted to having taken up late, at 25). ''I got tired of living on charm,'' he said, with a nod and a wink to 25-year-old me. Matthews may not have been a ''great'' poet, but he was one of my life's great teachers. When I learned he had died, I felt the pang of a lost opportunity to converse again with this generous soul who had a passion for communicating and who never failed to grace me with his penetrating insight.
