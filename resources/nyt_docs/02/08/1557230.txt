To the Editor:
Re ''Partisan Words to Remember Them By'' (Coping, by Anemona Hartocollis, Feb. 1), about people who used death notices to solicit contributions to defeat President Bush: What a splendid idea! I feel sure if I pass away during the current administration, my family will do the same thing for me.
To me this is no more tacky than a death notice suggesting donations be made to the Cancer Society or any other charity, in fact rather less. The Bush gang should be terrified by this movement, as the deceased's opinion carries rather more weight, curiously similar to a dying confession.
