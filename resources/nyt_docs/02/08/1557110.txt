A strong breeze is blowing through the seaport of Genoa these days, bringing a host of cultural offerings. As one of Europe's two capitals of culture this year (the other is Lille, France), the city has invested heavily to put its best face forward.
Construction is still going on throughout the city. Road crews operate at a steady clip, making it a challenge to navigate some streets, and many palazzi in the historic center are still covered in scaffolding.
So far, results have been worth the wait. During the 16th century, when it had strong commercial and political ties with the rest of Europe, Genoa was a city of palazzi that were painted magnificently colorful so sailors could identify their homes after years at sea. Those details are emerging again from expert restorations; faux cornices, statues and stuccoed altars draw the eye upward.
Genoa has remained, above all, a sea city. The port remains busy, moving millions of passengers and containers each year. Impossibly large yachts are moored in the marina.
Because of its seafaring history, Genoa chose to make ''the voyage'' the theme of the cultural year, focusing on the spreading and merging of cultures through travel. The year's events, listed at www.genova-2004.it, hint at these exchanges, whether between Flanders and Genoa in the 17th century or between Genoese culture and the rest of the world today.
Events
The blockbuster art exhibition, ''The Age of Rubens'' at the Ducal Palace, Piazza Matteotti 9, (39-010) 562-390, www.palazzoducale.genova.it, runs from March 20 until July 11.

Sightseeing
Genoa's medieval center is an intricate honeycomb of carruggi -- the narrow streets flanked by tall buildings, some so close together that neighbors could shake hands across the alleyways.
Some streets, like the Via del Campo and Via San Luca, have been lightly gentrified. Others, like the Via Macelli di Soziglia or Via di Prè, have retained their somewhat seamy ancient air, but are safe to walk. The Via di Sottoripa, the shop-lined covered walkway that borders the Old Port, has roots in the 12th century, and shopkeepers still peddle diverse wares, from cork to fresh and fried fish to knockoffs of brand-name running shoes.
Nestled within this long-ago model of mass urban settlement are gems like the Church of San Donato, Via di San Donato 10, one of the few -- along with San Giovanni di Prè -- Romanesque churches that were spared 17th-century makeovers. The octagonal tower and a 1515 altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi by Joos van Cleve are its most notable features.
The Gothic cathedral of San Lorenzo, on Piazza San Lorenzo, houses the marble-lined Chapel of St. John the Baptist, with an urn containing the saint's ashes. If you crane your neck you can see frescoes by Luca Cambiaso in a chapel to the left of the high altar.
Nearby, the Piazza San Matteo, lined with palazzi that once belonged to members of the Doria family (the city's most powerful clan during the Renaissance), gives an inkling of what Genoese life was like when the city's dynasties carved up and fortified their neighborhoods.
In 1550, the local nobility demanded, and got, a new street (later named the Via Garibaldi) on which to build sumptuous new homes. Most of the palazzi are now banks or offices, but three contain museums. The Palazzo Bianco usually home to a collection of Renaissance and Baroque art is closed for restoration, but the Palazzo Rosso, via Garibaldi 18, (39-010) 247-6351, with its collection of 17th- and 18th-century art, notably Van Dycks, is open; tickets $4. The Palazzo Tursi (city hall) is restructuring a wing as a museum, but it's possible to walk up to the terraces to take in the views.
The Palazzo Reale, via Balbi 10, (39-010) 27101, the former 17th-century residence of the Balbi family, has elegant fresco-filled rooms and a grand terrace; and the Galleria Nazionale di Palazzo Spinola, piazza Pellicceria 1, (39-010) 270-5300, has most of its 17th-century furnishings and a fine collection of paintings including the poignant ''Ecce Homo'' by Antonello da Messina.
Modern fancy neighborhoods are in the eastern part of the city. Streets off the Via XX Settembre, an elegant porticoed avenue built at the end of the 19th century, are filled with designer shops.
Nearby is the Piazza Dante, where on weekends it's possible to visit a ramshackle house that has been identified (with reservations) as Christopher Columbus's boyhood home; (39-010) 246-5346; $3.80.
The architect Renzo Piano, a Genoese, redesigned the Old Port for the 1992 anniversary of Columbus's voyage, revitalizing the area. Apart from shops and restaurants, there's the City of Children, (39-010) 247-5702, and www.cittadeibambini.net, a hands-on museum for the under-14 crowd; tickets, $6.35.
And a museum dedicated to the shadow puppets of one of Genoa's most famous contemporary artists, Emanuele Luzzati, the illustrator and theatrical designer, opened last year in the Porta Siberia, a 16th-century gatehouse; (39-010) 253-0328, www.museoluzzati.it. Tickets, $5.
Towering above the port is Mr. Piano's Bigo, a spider-legged elevator that affords breathtaking views for $4.25.
He also designed the Bolla, or bubble, off the aquarium, a tropical greenhouse. The Bolla is open daily, except Monday, until sunset. Tickets, $5.
Where to Stay
With only 10 rooms and a suite, the Locanda di Palazzo Cicala, Piazza San Lorenzo 16, (39-010) 2518-824, fax (39-010) 246-7414, and www.palazzocicala.it, is often booked far in advance. A restored 18th-century palazzo overlooking Genoa's cathedral, the hotel has huge rooms furnished with ultramodern furniture. Rates for doubles: $190 to $240, with breakfast.
The Best Western Hotel Metropoli, Piazza Fontane Marose, (39-010) 2468-888, fax (39-010) 246-8686, www.bestwestern.com, has 48 rooms, most of them recently refurbished in a cheery, modern, functional style, on a central square.

Suspended over the water on its own pier in the old port, the three-year-old Jolly Hotel Marina, Molo Ponte Calvi, (39-010) 25391, fax (39-010) 251-1320, www.jollyhotels.it, has been designed to feel like a luxurious ocean vessel, complete with brass and mahogany woodwork.

Where to Eat
Da Rina, Mura delle Grazie 3R, telephone and fax (39-010) 246-6475, serves traditional Genoese cuisine using the freshest of ingredients. Small fried dumplings and focaccia, Genoa's take on pizza, are good ways to start any meal. The menu of local favorites includes baccala (deep-fried cod) and stoccafisso alla Genovese, cod cooked with potatoes, olives and pine nuts drenched with olive oil. Dinner for two with wine, $90. Closed Monday and in August
Another local favorite, Da Maria, Vico Testadoro 14R, (39-010) 581-080, has been around since the 1940's. Orchestra members from the nearby opera house and dock workers alike frequent this no-frills trattoria. The best dish may be its basil-laced minestrone, but the torta pasqualina, a Genoese version of quiche, is also good. Best of all is the price: about $25 for a meal for two, with wine. Closed Monday night and Saturday.
The Tre Merli restaurant and wine bar, in the Palazzina Millo, (39-010) 246-4416, fax (39-010) 246-5466, a faux-warehouse in the old port, might be known to some New Yorkers because of the owners' three locations in Manhattan. Here, a classic local menu is served in an elegant ambience. It's a good place to try farinata di ceci alla Genovese, a flat chickpea polenta that's typical of the Ligurian Riviera, or chickpea tagliatelle, dressed with baby squids and artichokes. About $115 for two with wine. Closed Monday.
For a light lunch or afternoon aperitif, the Caffè degli Specchi, Salita Pollaiuoli 43R, (39-010) 246-8193, is a good choice. Its charming, mirrored Art Deco interior hasn't changed much since the 1920's. After days of pasta al pesto, the Genoese war horse, a plate of vegetables with fresh mozzarella might be a welcome switch. A meal for two with wine is $50; closed Sunday.
At La Bitta nella Pergola, Via Casaregis 52, phone and fax (39-010) 588543, the chefs, Rosa and Raffaele Balzano, clearly love their jobs. The vegetable terrine with seafood and seasoned smoked tuna appetizer is a savory lead-in to the seafood tempura with saffron couscous, as light as fried food can be. Handmade chocolates top off the meal. Figure $190 for two with wine. Closed Sunday night and Monday, and Aug. 8 to 31.
