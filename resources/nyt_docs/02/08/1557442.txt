To the Sports Editor:
How very heartening to read in ''The Lessons of Chicago's West Side'' (Jan. 27) that even as president of the Knicks, Isiah Lord Thomas ''still relies on the support of his mother,'' now 81. And why not? And learning he is happiest when he is in the living room with his family of origin, ''just listening to them talk.''
Lessons for all of us there; too often families of origin, including mothers and fathers, are benched by offspring who become successful in their work life, or too often, even when they don't.
