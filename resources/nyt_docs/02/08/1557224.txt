To the Editor:
Re ''The Cost Basis in the Haystack'' (Midstream, Jan. 25), in which James Schembari described his quest to learn what he originally paid for a stock:
Since my retirement, I have been working as a seasonal personal tax preparer. Cost basis is the No.1 topic that makes my clients look like deer caught in the headlights. The road is especially bumpy when the sold shares were originally received as gifts, say, from an uncle at notable milestones in life.
Personally, I do not look forward to the day when my wife sells pieces of what initially was a small inheritance of AT&amp;T shares, before the days of Baby Bells and spinoffs. That has to be one of the world's worst bowls of cost-basis spaghetti. The idea of donating all the stock to charity is excellent, since it removes the need to know the basis.
