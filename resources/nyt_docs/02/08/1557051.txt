MADRAS ON RAINY DAYS
By Samina Ali.
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.
Nineteen-year-old Layla, the unhappy heroine of Samina Ali's earnest first novel, has spent her short life shuttling between Minneapolis and the ancient Indian city of Hyderabad. ''Different worlds, and in each I was a different woman, unrecognizable even to myself.'' At the novel's start, she's returned to Hyderabad, after a year of college in Minneapolis, to marry Sameer, the handsome young engineer her domineering parents selected for her (or, in Layla's view, ''sold'' her to). With her chador and her quiet ways, Layla's the picture of Muslim modesty. But she harbors a grave secret: just before leaving Minnesota, she began a clandestine romance with an American student, which left her pregnant. For weeks, she's taken birth control pills to induce a miscarriage. As her elaborate five-day wedding begins, Layla's body is still ''cramping and spitting blood'' -- and she is hoping her new husband, a virtual stranger, won't notice. Sameer, it turns out, has a secret of his own (which the reader will intuit long before Layla does). The couple gamely try to make a go of their union, while India crumbles around them, racked by Hindu-Muslim violence. Rife with gothic plot twists and stagy dialogue (''Layla, do not be in the darkness, as your name suggests''), the novel descends into melodrama that is livened by Ali's astute, almost anthropological commentary on contemporary Hyderabad society.
