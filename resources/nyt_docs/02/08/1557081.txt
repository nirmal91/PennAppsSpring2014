The music that Norah Jones (Rob Hoerburger, Jan. 25) and her talented colleagues create engages three types of people: those lucky enough to be in love, those who hope to be in love and those who remember a great love, now gone.
Since being introduced to Jones's magic by my daughter almost two years ago, I've bought more than 15 copies of her first CD to send to music lovers and thankless old lovers. Jones's sound and interpretations transport me; her respect for the surprising blue note and her ability to caress a careful lyric are unique.
New brides dance to her music and name their dogs after her. And the rest of us, we've been sitting here waiting for her, so she should come on home and turn us on. We'll be feelin' the same way all over again.
