Where's the beef after the mad cow scare? Well, researchers at Cook College, the agricultural school of Rutgers University, say it's right back on virtually everyone's table.
''We found that only one percent of Americans who had heard of the mad-cow case in Washington State have given up beef and are not going back,'' said William Hallman, a psychologist with the Food Policy Institute at Cook, who is the lead researcher on a study charting the country's meat-eating habits after a cow was discovered with mad cow disease on Dec. 23.
The survey of 1,001 people nationwide was taken by telephone from Jan. 15-18.
''We did the survey because everything seemed to be coming from the meat industry and we are a research institute with a mission to find out what is really going on with food issues,'' Dr. Hallman said.
He noted: ''The most interesting thing is that three-fourths of the people who have reduced consumption of beef were switching over instead to other meats, rather than giving it up altogether. We found no new vegetarians.''
Two-thirds of those surveyed said their confidence in the beef-supply chain had not changed, and only 22 percent said it had gotten worse -- though not by much. In addition, 8 percent said their confidence had actually been raised, reasoning that the publicity would put the industry under greater scrutiny.
''Even most of those who said they were stopping eating beef said they were only going to do so for a little while -- just until things blew over,'' said Dr. Hallman. ''So it seems there are little change in habits, at least for now.''
