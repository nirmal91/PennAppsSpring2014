ANNISA  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 741-6699; 13 Barrow Street (near Seventh Avenue); $$$; Review: 8/23/00.
Annisa, whose name means women in Arabic, is a two-woman show. Anita Lo, who worked at Mirezi, turns out the food, and Jennifer Scism runs the front of the house. The cool minimally decorated dining room has a welcoming atmosphere and a contemporary American menu full of arresting combinations of ingredients and flavors.

The Venezuelan husband-and-wife owners, Maribel Araujo and Aristides Barrios, opened Caracas last summer, and already it has become a lively destination for South American expatriates. This tiny spot may win Venezuelan arepas, or corn cakes, the recognition they deserve.
JEWEL BAKO  (212) 979-1012; 239 East Fifth Street (near Second Avenue); $$; $25 and Under: 7/11/01.
The clean lines of the small dining room echo the purity of the sushi, and the creations of the chef, Masato Shimizu, form a sublime experience. Add the welcoming charm of the husband-wife owners, Jack and Grace Lamb, and you come close to an ideal neighborhood sushi bar.

The chef, John Greco 3rd, owns Philip Marie with his wife, Suzanne, who oversees the dining room. The name Philip Marie combines their middle names. This warm, welcoming restaurant has hearty American fare with creative twists.
THE RIVERDALE GARDEN  (718) 884-5232; 4574 Manhattan College Parkway (West 242nd Street), Bronx; $$; Article: 1/14/04.

THE TASTING ROOM  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 358-7831; 72 East First Street (near First Avenue); $$; Review: 5/16/01.
This small restaurant is the dream project of the chef, Colin Alevras, and his wife, Renée, who greets you with a sunny smile. The small menu has two prices for every dish other than desserts. This lets diners combine several tasting portions into a meal or order an appetizer and main course. The wine list features about 350 nicely priced American wines.
