The Sayreville Street Sign Soir√©e might not have the same ring as the Boston Tea Party, but for some mayors it has its own resonance.
A fight over a stop sign near the Morgan Little League fields in Sayreville has led the Assembly Transportation Committee to take a big step toward giving mayors the authority to install the signs without permission from state regulators.
As it stands, mayors cannot install stop or yield signs without approval of the State Department of Transportation, even when they do not affect state or county highways.
But Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, the committee chairman, said legislators thought it was silly to force mayors to wait months or more for approval from Trenton to put a stop sign at an intersection.
''A lot of time it is nothing more complex than an intersection by a school, or a playground,'' said Mr. Wisniewski, who happens to be from Sayreville.
He brought the measure up after a councilman from Sayreville complained that his town was having difficulty putting up a sign to slow cars speeding past the baseball field because state regulators said it not meet the department's guidelines.
''The simple act of putting up a stop sign could not happen,'' Mr. Wisniewski said. ''It made sense, so why not do it?''
For now, the sign is still not up. For that to happen, the full Legislature and the governor have to sign off on the measure.
And spring training is not nearly here.
