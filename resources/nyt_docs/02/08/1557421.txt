Bad weather has contributed to critical shortages in New Jersey's blood supply, several of the state's blood centers reported last week. Officials of Community Blood Services in Paramus and the American Red Cross Blood Services of the Penn-New Jersey Region in Philadelphia said they were down to a one-day supply. Both centers were in critical need of O negative. Community Blood Services, which covers Bergen, Passaic, Hudson and Essex Counties, as well as Rockland and Orange Counties in New York, also needs B negative. American Red Cross Blood Services, which provides blood for counties primarily in South Jersey as well as southeastern Pennsylvania, is also critically short of O positive. The severe weather, especially heavy snowfall, caused the cancellation of bloodmobile drives, said Karen Ferriday, a spokeswoman in the Paramus center.
