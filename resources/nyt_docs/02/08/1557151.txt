To some, the New York City Building Code is an amalgam of obscure specifications, redefined in a plethora of subchapter references, tables, citations and amendments. To others it is a thing of subtlety and wisdom that has defined the qualities of the many thousands of buildings erected in the city since it was adopted in 1968. But now that the 1968 code is approaching middle age -- though it is still called the ''new'' code -- it is getting a face lift: a redesigned edition numbering almost a thousand pages that goes on sale on Wednesday.
The new two-volume edition, weighing nine pounds, includes improved tables and redrawn diagrams and incorporates a decade's worth of changes since the last edition was published. For the first time, it puts the actual text of the code in one volume (474 pages) and the subsidiary references, rules and regulations in the second (508 pages).
The city administration is pressing for an entirely new version of the code based on a model code known as the International Building Code; the new edition has been redesigned in two columns to resemble it. The code will be available for $65 by calling 311; at the Municipal Building in Manhattan; or at www.nyc.gov/citystore.
