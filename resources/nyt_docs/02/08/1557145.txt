An answer to a question in the Streetscapes column last Sunday about the 1883 construction of a mansion at 74th Street and Fifth Avenue designed by the architect Henry G. Harrison referred incorrectly to citations in the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals. While there are no references to articles about his buildings published during Harrison's lifetime, the index indeed mentions him: it includes both an obituary and a biographical article published in 1982.
