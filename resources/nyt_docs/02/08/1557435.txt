Yet another Camden landmark has been saved.
Last week, local developers bought the old Sears building -- an ornate Greek Revival affair and the company's first foray into suburban America -- at the foot of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard.
Joseph Gonnelli of Mount Laurel and Brian Jackson of Voorhees bought the building and the surrounding 3.5-acre property for $2.5 million from Aliza Realty of Delran. The buyers had owned the South Jersey Expo Center in Pennsauken, which they sold last year. That property will become part of a new civic center and arena complex.
The buyers say they are not sure what to do with their new property, which is listed on the National Historic Register, though they say they have no plans to demolish it.
The building -- built in the company's heyday in 1927 -- thrived through World War II and into the 60's, but closed in 1971 when Sears began putting more of their stores in or near shopping malls. It was abandoned for a short time, but then the city of Camden leased it at various times, and it now houses the City Housing Authority.
But as the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia was approaching in 2000, Gov. Christie Whitman encouraged a plan to raze the old buildings along the south side of Admiral Wilson Boulevard and replace them with parkland.
Mark Willis, who owned the building at the time, balked at the price he was offered for the building and haggled with the city over taxes. So while the rest of the buildings along the two-mile stretch were demolished, the Sears building was saved through Mr. Willis's steadfastness, joining the former RCA Victor building as a survivor along Camden's waterfront. Eventually Mr. Willis sold the Sears building to Aliza Realty for $1.2 million.
Nipper's tail over at the old RCA building may even be wagging.
