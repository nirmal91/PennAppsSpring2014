To the Editor: As an owner of an interior design company, I found your article ''Marble Baths: Watch Your Step'' (Practical Traveler, Jan. 18) quite thought provoking.
Shower curtains can be replaced by sliding textured glass or acrylic doors. This avoids puddling and will allow vanity lighting to filter into the tub. Adding 2-inch-by-2-inch inserts of the same marble tile on a marble floor leaves the floor glossy but with grout lines that provide a solid purchase for the foot.
Grab bars should be mandatory, especially in tub showers, but must be installed into the structure of the wall.
