Suffolk County homicide detectives have identified one of four bodies dumped in the woods around Manorville over the past three years. The identified woman, Jessica Taylor, 20, was a prostitute, the police said, who was last seen working in Midtown Manhattan last July.
Ms. Taylor's nude body, with her head and hands severed, was discovered July 26 by a woman walking her dog near Halsey Manor Road and the Long Island Expressway. It was the third to be found along an 11-mile stretch of woods since November 2000. The first was a female chopped into pieces and stuffed into trash bags, her head, hands and right foot missing. The two others were intact males.
Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick, the head of the homicide squad, said neither Ms. Taylor's identity nor evidence recovered with her remains suggest any link to the other bodies. ''We just don't have any information to make that decision one way or the other,'' he said.
A partial tattoo, DNA testing and Ms. Taylor's arrest record -- she had been charged with prostitution in Washington, Atlantic City and New York -- helped identity her, he said.
Suffolk police released photos of the tattoo, showing a wing, shortly after her body was found, prompting a response from a Washington detective. Through the Washington police, Suffolk detectives were able to contact members of Ms. Taylor's estranged family and obtain DNA samples that clinched the body's identification.
The entire tattoo had been a winged heart with ''Remy's angel'' written inside, Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said. He described Remy as ''an acquaintance'' of Ms. Taylor, declining to provide further information.
