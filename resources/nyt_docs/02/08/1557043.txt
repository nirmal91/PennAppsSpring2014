THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND
The Bartimaeus Trilogy: Book One.
By Jonathan Stroud.
Miramax/Hyperion, $17.95.
(Ages 8 and up)
A precocious wizard in training, forced to grow up in an adoptive household under the thumb of a cruel patron. An implacable foe, driven by dreams of world domination, who schemes for a youngster's destruction. A desperate quest for a talisman crucial to the boy's survival. Sound familiar?
Actually, these Potteresque plot elements are spun into surprisingly colorful cloth in this tale of an 11-year-old magician's apprentice, Nathaniel, sold by his parents to a middle-ranking official in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in a modern-day London governed by magicians. After a humiliating encounter with a fiendish wizard named Simon Lovelace sets Nathaniel's blood boiling, he somehow manages to summon a 5,010-year-old djinni from the Other Place to help him steal the powerful Amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace.
Unfortunately, Bartimaeus turns out to be a diabolical Aladdin, with a sharp tongue, ancient memory and withering contempt for magicians. In fact, the djinni spends most the book scheming to escape his servitude, though the threat of a spell of indefinite confinement in a tobacco tin binds him to Nathaniel as they uncover a grand conspiracy to unleash malevolent forces in a coup to unseat the government. Nathaniel isn't exactly a white-bread hero -- he has a conscience but is not above lying, stealing and even killing in the name of vengeance -- but the witty, shape-shifting Bartimaeus (whose essence allows him to assume any guise, from wisp of smoke to fly, from gargoyle to scarab beetle) is the main show. How can Books 2 and 3 possibly top the adventures here? Well, you'd need to steal a scrying glass, or crystal, to find out.
