IF typefaces had feelings, Feb. 1 would have been a sad day for Courier New. That was the day the State Department banished it from official written materials in favor of Times New Roman, saying it was easier to read. (This article is written in Times New Roman.)
''In response to many requests and with a view to making our written work easier to read,'' a department memo read, ''we are moving to a new standard font: Times New Roman 14. TNR 14 takes up almost exactly the same area on the page as Courier New 12, while offering a crisper, cleaner, more modern look.''
It was a crushing reversal for Courier New, which was itself the essence of modernity in the early 1960's. A Swiss type designer, Adrian Frutiger, created it for the I.B.M. Selectric typewriter.
Courier New is a living link to a vanished technology, and that sealed its doom. Oddly, though, the typeface that bumped it is even older. Times New Roman, designed by the Monotype Corporation, made its debut in The Times of London in 1932.

Correction:  March 7, 2004, Sunday  An article Feb. 8 about a State Department memo discontinuing the use of the Courier New typeface on official documents referred incorrectly to the face's history. Courier New is Microsoft's name for its digital version of Courier, a face created for International Business Machines Corporation in the 1950's and used widely on electric typewriters. Courier was designed by Howard Kettler, not Adrian Frutiger.
