THE GOOSE GIRL
By Shannon Hale.
Bloomsbury,
$17.95. (Ages 10 and up)
Though Shannon Hale's enchanting new version of ''The Goose Girl'' follows the outline of the original Grimm version exactly, she adds such depth and scope that it seems a wonder the story could have been told so sparsely. In both versions a princess is betrothed to a prince in a faraway kingdom. On the way to her wedding, her handmaid assumes her identity and tricks the king into thinking she is his son's bride-to-be, forcing the real princess to take a job herding geese.
This takes four pages in the Grimm version. Hale introduces us to Princess Ani, who grows from a curious, open-hearted child into a shy teenager. She can speak with birds yet cannot manage small talk with people. So her mother decides Ani will never make a suitable ruler and sends her away at 16 to marry a prince she has never met in a land she has never visited.
In layer upon layer of detail a beautiful coming-of-age story emerges, a tale about learning to rescue yourself rather than falling accidentally into happily-ever-after. Hale uncovers her theme patiently and without preaching, focusing not on the moral but on the adventures her heroine must face in order to learn the lessons herself. The truly frightening moments are never gratuitous. Young readers may recognize parallels with their own lives in even her most magical adventures: the loneliness of feeling peculiar, the devastation of betrayal, the pride of sharing your talents and the joy of finding people to love and trust.
