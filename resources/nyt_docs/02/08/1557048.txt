EMPRESS ORCHID
By Anchee Min.
Houghton Mifflin, $24.
An absorbing companion piece to her novel, ''Becoming Madame Mao'' (2000), Anchee Min's ''Empress Orchid'' is also based on the life of a powerful but frequently denigrated female leader. Having lived through China's Cultural Revolution, the author is wary of official history, especially when it concerns women. She went out of her way to search obscure Beijing archives for the truth about Tzu Hsi (1834-1908), the dowager empress of China for nearly 50 years, who is described in some Chinese history books as ''the enemy of the human race.'' ''Empress Orchid'' is only the first part of her story, which Min will continue in another book. It focuses on Tzu Hsi's life as a young concubine, one of many women competing for the attentions of ''our husband,'' Emperor Hsien Feng. When they are married, an imperial eunuch informs Tzu Hsi that she is no longer herself or even half of a couple: ''You have become part of His Majesty.'' The concubines' jealousies and betrayals fuel the court intrigue; meanwhile, the emperor fails to defeat foreign meddlers, who send the Forbidden City royals packing. As the disheartened 31-year-old emperor lies dying, it's Tzu Hsi who takes charge, positioning their 5-year-old son as heir to the throne, executing scapegoats and beheading a ruthless militarist who plans a coup. After all, she claims, ''terror was needed in order to make a statement.'' Min can be a clunky storyteller, and she rarely makes you warm to this calculating creature, but she does succeed in suggesting how Tzu Hsi got this way.
