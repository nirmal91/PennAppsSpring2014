An article on Jan. 25 about the amateur filmmaker Sidney N. Laverents credited his ''Multiple SIDosis'' incorrectly with a first. In fact it was the fourth amateur work included in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress -- after the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination; home movies of a World War II internment camp for Japanese-Americans; and film of the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse in 1940.
