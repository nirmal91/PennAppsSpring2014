To the Editor:
The good news about the unpicked but mostly quite worthy designs for the 9/11 memorial [''The Memorial Roads Not Taken'' by Julie V. Iovine, Feb. 1] is that at least three of them employ the columns of the North Tower facade. The bad news is that they are generally too abstract and pretty. To be truly beautiful, powerful and moving, the facade must be reinstalled as the jagged, ghostly shell it was after miraculously surviving the attack: to be memorable, it must be horrible.
