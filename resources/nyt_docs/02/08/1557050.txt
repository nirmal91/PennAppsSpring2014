GRAFT
By Brian Henry.
New Issues, paper, $14.
Brian Henry's third poetry collection is about sex. He restlessly encircles his subject, studying what it means to be ''at another's mercy,'' exploring desire, obsession, ambivalence and heartbreak. Inchoate yearning seems more appealing than consummation; in ''Look Around,'' the speaker spends his days watching a woman through her apartment window: ''I have no job but to watch, and this I do / daily, and with the joy resignation brings.'' To fulfill sexual hunger results always in ''the body you desire a ruin beside yours.'' In ''This Blueness Not All Blue'' (a recurring title in the book), Henry writes of ''the point where we undid each other,'' the point ''where we rescued each other / from the cold, bundled each other into packets to cradle.'' His speakers recognize the toll of self-inflicted suffering, the futility of continuing to ''obsess over what they've lost / instead of what they've been offered,'' but are overcome by a sense of helplessness. ''Graft'' offers a bleak vision of sexual love -- more shameful than satisfying -- yet one that is fascinating, complex and, perhaps all too often, right on.
