To the Editor:
Your article ''Lost Camera and One Knight's Heroic Fantasy'' (Jan. 18) prompts me to tell of my own white knight, Bruno Vigliani, whom I have never actually met.
Last September I was in a group trekking through the French Alps. On the fourth day, resting at a high pass, I inadvertently left my camera where we sat. I did not realize my loss until it was too late to retrace my steps. I left details of the camera with the hotel where we stayed that night, against the remote possibility that a traveler on the same route the next day might bring it in.
Two days later Bruno found the camera where I had left it. He had developed the pictures in my camera (sounds familiar?) and so could reconstruct my route up to the point of losing the camera. He wrote many e-mail messages to hotels and trekking organizations in the region, and via the hotel where we stayed, he tracked me down and the camera came home to London.
Bruno revealed enough of himself in that first e-mail for me to continue the correspondence, which is still going. He said he felt like Sherlock Holmes. I replied that the British nation was flattered by his choice, but couldn't he be an Italian detective?
