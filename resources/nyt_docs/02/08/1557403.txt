Nearly two months after the election, Glen Cove residents are no closer to knowing who won the sixth seat on their City Council. An appellate court ruling on Jan. 30 declared the contest a tie.
Lawyers representing the two candidates -- the incumbent Democratic councilman, Joseph Gioino, and his Republican opponent, Grady Farnan -- say either the current Council will appoint a winner or a special election will be held. Republicans oppose a Council appointment as the current governing body is entirely Democratic.
When the polls closed on election night, Mr. Gioino, a 35-year-old lawyer and executive director of the Nassau Industrial Development Agency, was ahead of Mr. Farnan, a 42-year-old insurance adjuster, by a single vote, 3,134 to 3,133.
In the days that followed, representatives from both parties sifted through the 285 paper absentee and affidavit ballots, challenging ballots for having stray marks or for being cast by unregistered voters. Results certified by Justice Ute Wolff Lally of State Supreme Court in Garden City put Mr. Farnan up by five votes. Then an appeals court in Brooklyn was asked to rule on 11 paper ballots. Most were challenged for having ''extrinsic marks,'' or markings outside the voting box.
The appellate panel reinstituted four Democratic votes knocked out by the lower court and invalidated one Republican vote, producing the tie.
