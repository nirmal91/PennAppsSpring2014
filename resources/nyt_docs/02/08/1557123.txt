To the Editor: We decided to do an exchange in 1984 for the first time. We were fortunate enough to find an American couple teaching at the American School in London who were from Connecticut. They agreed to live in our home in upstate New York for eight weeks while we occupied their home in Elstree, outside of London. It was wonderful.
The next summer, we exchanged homes with a couple in Denmark. Those first two swaps were accomplished with the help of a friend and a relative. The next two exchanges were done through a teacher-based home exchange.
The last swap was very disillusioning in that it was far from what was promised. We left the house and set out on our own by train throughout Italy. Exchanging homes has risks, but the benefits are far greater.
