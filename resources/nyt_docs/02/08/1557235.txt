To the Editor:
Two articles back to back in the Feb. 1 issue show a failure to get to get to the institutional root causes of local problems.
''Wild Masonry, Murderous Metal and Mr. Blonde,'' a mood piece on the tragic death of Jodie Lane on Jan. 16, fails to indict Con Ed for its abysmal maintenance record, or the hidden fact that its multitude of electrical plates across the city are potentially dangerous and not inspected adequately, as potential electrocution devices for thousands of unsuspecting New Yorkers should be.
I know from experience: The sidewalk -- not a plate -- in front of my house was electrified a decade ago, and it took some doing to get Con Ed to fix it.
Now since Ms. Lane's tragic death, Con Ed reports it has corrected 110 ''cases of stray voltage'' in the city and inspected about half of its metal covers in the city. But, if 110 cases were found and only half the covers have been checked, shouldn't the public be alarmed and extremely wary?
As for the item in the F.Y.I. column ''When MetroCard Fails'': It is the MetroCard system that fails, in the failure to clean the card readers, so when the card user keeps being told to ''please swipe again'' 10 or 20 times, nothing is wrong with the card.
