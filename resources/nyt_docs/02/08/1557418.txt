New Jersey Transit has again delayed the opening of the River Line -- the long-awaited South Jersey commuter rail link from Trenton to Camden -- from Feb. 15 to March 14. The problem, according to the transit agency, is that some gates along the line are getting stuck in the down position during trial runs. In addition, since there has to be a weeklong stretch of test runs with no problems, the severe weather has not given the agency a sufficient window to complete the tasks. The River Line, whose cost has amounted to nearly $1 billion, has been criticized as unnecessary and overly expensive. New Jersey Transit estimates that when the line opens, it will carry 5,700 passengers a day, operating every 15 minutes at rush hour and every 30 minutes at other times on the 34-mile route. Initial fares will be $1.10 each way. But because the line will use the same tracks as freight trains, it will operate only between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. For now, New Jersey Transit estimates that the River Line will operate at a deficit of $75 million a year.
