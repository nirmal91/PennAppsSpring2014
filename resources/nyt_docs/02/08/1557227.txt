Re ''Banks Try to Pave the Way to Online Bill Paying'' (Jan. 18):
Readers need to be cautious in setting up such payment systems. Once you set up the payee's address, account number and other supplier information in the system, you just enter the invoice amount when paying a bill electronically. I have been doing this for five years and recently had my family medical insurance canceled for late payment. In addition, my propane supplier placed me on a credit watch and a utility company listed me on a credit report as paying late.
This happened because the suppliers of these services changed the addresses to which the automatic checks were to be sent, without highlighting the changes. I continued to pay the bills to the old addresses; ultimately, the checks were forwarded to the suppliers, who cashed them and recorded them as late. Also, the suppliers did not call to inform me of my chronic late payments.
If you use electronic bill paying, be sure to check companies' addresses often.
