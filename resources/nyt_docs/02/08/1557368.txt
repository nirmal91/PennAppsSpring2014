To the Editor:
Re ''A Religious Renewal at the Salvation Army Raises the Threat of a Church-State Dispute'' (news article, Feb. 2):
As a 40-plus-year contributor to the Salvation Army, I am appalled by the reversion to ''spread the Gospel.'' The Salvation Army has been doing just that by helping the poor; its message is in their doing. Change comes by good work, not by preaching.
The harm done all over the world by missionaries is only assuaged by their contributions to education and relief of misery. As a Quaker, I must re-evaluate my commitment to this great organization that seemed only to want to relieve suffering.
