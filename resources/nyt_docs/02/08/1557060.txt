Growing up, Niloofar Bassir played soccer with the boys in her neighborhood. Among them, she was the only kid who wanted to play professionally. But in Iran, where soccer is considered unwomanly, it was an unlikely dream. ''Our neighbors looked at her awkwardly whenever she was playing football with the boys and said it was a mistake she was born a girl,'' her mother says. But in 1998, the daughter of a former Iranian president, Faezeh Hashemi, helped start indoor games for girls as well as the first women's teams, one of which Bassir, now 19, plays defense for, making $36 a month.
Like the heroine of the hit movie ''Bend It Like Beckham,'' Bassir takes her cues from the English star David Beckham. ''I carefully watch on TV the way he kicks the ball,'' she says. She braided her hair after he did, even though she's obligated to wear a scarf in public.
Bassir practicing in her room. When she saw an ad inviting women to play indoor soccer six years ago, there were no female coaches. Bassir's had to be taught before she could lead the squad.
When Bassir and her crew kick the ball around in Tehran parks, middle-aged men often mock them. A few times, the girls have challenged their tormenters to a game and beaten them.
Women in Iran must be clothed from head to toe, so only female fans can watch Bassir compete in her uniform of shorts and a T-shirt. ''Even my father cannot see me play at a stadium,'' she says.
