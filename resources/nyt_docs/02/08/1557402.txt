Mayor Dannel Malloy of Stamford became the first registered candidate for the 2006 gubernatorial election, according to the office of the secretary of state.
Mr. Malloy, 48, a Democratic currently serving his third term as mayor, said he announced his decision last Tuesday morning because he needed to start raising money and become more familiar to voters in other areas of the state.
''To put the decision off any longer would've probably eliminated me from consideration,'' he said. ''I've got to get out there and meet the people. I'm from a portion of the state that a lot of people don't know about. They don't know me. They don't know my track record.''
Mr. Malloy, a former New York City assistant district attorney and a Stamford native, thinks the major issues will be the effectiveness of state government, transportation, health care, jobs and the state's tax structure.
If elected governor, Mr. Malloy said he would hire the best people available, despite party affiliation or political experience. He insisted that his run for governor would not hinder his duties as mayor.
''I'm going to have to work a little harder and get my work done,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''On the other hand, I've assembled a heck of a team in the city to help me.''
