The broad stock market rose last week on optimism that interest rates would remain low, although the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index posted its third consecutive weekly decline.
On Friday, a government report indicated that the economy had added fewer new jobs than expected, suggesting that inflation would remain stable and interest rates would not change. That helped to consolidate market gains. Wal-Mart led the Dow industrials with a gain of 6.9 percent for the week, after reporting a sales surge in January. Boeing, McDonald's and Coca-Cola also rose.
The Nasdaq had a rockier week. On Wednesday, tech stocks fell sharply after John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said corporations were still cautious about capital spending. Cisco, which makes telecommunications equipment, fell 8.8 percent that day, and closed the week down 3.5 percent.
For the week, the Dow rose 104.96 points, or 1 percent, to close at 10,593.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.63 points, also 1 percent, closing at 1,142.76. The Nasdaq fell 2.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,064.01. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.08 percent, down from 4.14 percent the previous Friday.
