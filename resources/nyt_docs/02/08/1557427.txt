To the Editor:
Hubert Herring (Soapbox: ''A Little Quiet, Please'') has written a beautifully expressive plea in behalf of many of us who find cellphone usage exasperating. It may be true that only 27 percent of the riders feel that this is a problem, but for many it is an obnoxious one.
People who run monopolies don't pay lots of attention to customer complaints. There are two rays of light, however. If enough people express sentiments such as Mr. Herring's, even those desk jockeys at Metro North will take notice. But if they are sued, let's say by a cellphone user assaulted by a frustrated, just-awakened passenger, they will surely remedy this situation.
They had no trouble handling ''smoking cars'' for decades, so Mr. Herring's request is not unrealistic. My bet is that, if carried out and market forces are allowed to prevail, silent cars will outnumber undesignated ones. And cellphone users will applaud the decision.
