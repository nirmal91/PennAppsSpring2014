I don't care if Terry McAuliffe ever met George W. Bush. Instead of asking cynical, silly questions, why didn't Matt Bai (The Way We Live Now, Jan. 25) spend more time on important issues? For example, New Jersey voters (along with those of other highly populated states) never get a real chance to help choose the candidate. Why aren't primary and caucus states rotated every four years? Why doesn't the national committee see to it that more candidates stay in the race?
