To the Editor:
Daniel Okrent's view (The Public Editor, Feb. 1) that important stories originating in other newspapers should not receive short shrift in The New York Times is well taken.
There is another, opposing phenomenon that readers decry -- hordes of newspapers and electronic media latching onto a story and running with it before finding out if it has validity. Or latching onto it because all the other media are running it. Or rushing to publish with woefully thin information just to get there first.
I was a reporter and editor for local community weeklies. I had one day a week to be fresh and new. Still, when a story warranted it, a story ran.
If I could verify and add to it, I did. If I couldn't, a lot of what was printed depended on where the story originated -- was the source credible? -- and how I credited the original reporting.
Important stories with strong credibility shouldn't sit on a shelf.
