To the Editor:
In ''Broken Hoop Dreams for the Basketball Players of Coney Island'' (Editorial Observer, Feb. 1), Brent Staples places the blame on the dreamer for dreaming. It is not the dreams or the dreamer that is broken in the so-called inner city; it is the communities.
In the case of Coney Island, it sounds as if the schools are in the most need of repair. The real dream killers are hopelessness and despair that these inept schools breed. Children should be allowed to dream, and they deserve schools that can at least prepare them for a prosperous future.
