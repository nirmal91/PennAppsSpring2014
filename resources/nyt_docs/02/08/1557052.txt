Just when you thought you'd investigated the American experience of World War II from every angle imaginable, along comes Steve Yarbrough with his fine third novel, PRISONERS OF WAR (Knopf, $23), the story of a makeshift German P.O.W. camp built in the Mississippi Delta in the summer of 1943. Well before the captured Germans arrive to pick cotton for local farmers, the inhabitants of Loring, Miss., past and present, have struggled against the complex terrors of war. It has roiled not just the lives of the boys off fighting, but those impatient to be, those who dodged and those who returned disillusioned or demented, as good as dead. Without neglecting the requisite small-town stragglers in this richly populous novel -- the aging sexpots and spinster telephone operators, the small-fry entrepreneurs and smarmy draft board officers -- Yarbrough writes with quiet compassion about Loring's black population, its reluctance to fight for a country that has so consistently betrayed its democratic promise. To this combustible setting will come a peculiar prisoner, one with an ''angry purple stain, either a birthmark or a rash,'' who speaks broken English and haunts one of the Loring natives assigned to guard him. It is the fate of this mysterious captive that once again forces the people of Loring to confront what it means to be American, and all the unexpected -- and often unwarranted -- sacrifices that identity might comprise.
