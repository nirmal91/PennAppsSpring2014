If the traditional bouquet of red roses seems too formal or clich√©d, consider the Threesome, by Raquel Corvino, a New York floral designer. It's a flight of silver bud vases, one with a clutch of sweet peas, another holding a pair of Dutch tulips and the third an anemone nosegay. The three-vase arrangement ($75 from Raquel Corvino, 212-255-0114) comes in a choice of pinks or lavenders. They can be scattered or grouped in a sweet tableau.
