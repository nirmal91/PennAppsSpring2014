To the Sports Editor:
Barry Sanders voted into the N.F.L. Hall of Fame at 35? This must be a record for youth for any American professional sport.
What a story! Sanders could, and should, still be playing in the N.F.L. I noticed in the photo of the inductees that he was the only one not smiling -- or expressing surprise at his induction.
