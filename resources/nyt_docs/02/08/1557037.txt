An entry in the And Bear in Mind column on Dec. 28, about ''There Are Jews in My House,'' a collection of stories by Lara Vapnyar, misstated the year of her immigration to the United States from Russia. It was 1994, not 1971. (A review of the book in The New York Observer on Jan. 19 alerted The Times to the error.)
