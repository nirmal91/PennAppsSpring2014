Re the dispute over Chabad Lubavitch's proposal to build a community center in Kings Point [Feb. 1], I was appalled to read that applause greeted the prejudiced rhetoric, ''Why do you want to be here when you're not welcome?'' I am certain that the attendees at the village board hearing in this heavily Jewish area would be distressed to learn that many communities adapted that tactless ploy to discourage their ancestors from moving into the area. We should strive to be an inclusive community. Why aren't our conscience-stricken residents and religious leaders attempting to ameliorate this injustice?
