An article last Sunday described the coming battle between Google and Microsoft over the Internet search business. It quoted Nancy Blachman, a computer scientist, as saying that Google had an advantage in the race because it had the most current users. The article also identified Ms. Blachman as the author of an independent guide to using Google but should have noted that Ms. Blachman, though not affiliated with that company, is married to a Google software engineer.
