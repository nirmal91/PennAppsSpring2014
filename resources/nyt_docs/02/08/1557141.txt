To the Editor:
Anthony Tommasini's essay ''In Praise of the Youthful Codgers'' [Feb. 1] reminded me of some great octogenarians who conducted the Metropolitan Opera, including Karl Böhm, who during a ''Rosenkavalier'' rehearsal amazingly detected a wrong note I played, pointed at me and whispered ''D flat'' and in every subsequent performance turned and smiled at me when we came to that spot.
However, my favorite codger-conductor was that spry gentleman Ernest Ansermet. After he led a magnificent ''Pelléas et Mélisande,'' my wife and I spied him in the Russian Tea Room, accompanied by two very attractive young ladies. He was sipping a cocktail, smoking one unfiltered cigarette after another and ingesting a hearty portion of some meat smothered with gravy and sour cream. The coda to this cardiologist's nightmare was the dessert: a gigantic mound of vanilla ice cream slathered with syrup and whipped cream, accompanied by a pitcher of coffee, two cognacs and at least three more cigarettes.
My wife nudged me and whispered: ''Maybe you should have been a conductor. They are so durable!''
