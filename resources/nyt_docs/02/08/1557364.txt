To the Editor:
Re ''Film Makes SAT Villain, and Students Can Relate'' (Education page, Feb. 4):
As the college-bound population has grown, the number of colleges and universities, at all levels of quality and selectivity, has not kept pace. The result: the influx of applications to a nearly constant number of institutions has increased, which has placed increasing demand on the schools to process these applications.
More processing requires more time, more admissions staff, more faculty effort -- and more money. At the same time, the institutions are being pressed to speed up the decision process.
Until the value system that supports college education is ready to pay for more individualized assessment, there is no real option. Standardized tests will continue to be the most cost-effective discriminator available.
