To the Sports Editor:
One can take Dave Anderson's habitual goading of the Red Sox in the spirit of the happy rivalry between our two cities, but when he insults my ballpark (''Foxboro Shows Fenway How to Do It,'' Feb. 3), well, them's fighting words.
That Fenway, the smallest and oldest of the 30 major league baseball stadiums, habitually sells out, is second in revenues and looks splendid with the recent physical improvements should be enough for Anderson to know that replacing Fenway will not change the Red Sox' fortunes. If it were that simple, World Series banners would be flying over the new stadiums in Baltimore, Detroit, San Francisco, Milwaukee, Chicago (A.L.), Texas, Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, Colorado, Houston, etc., by now.
The decrepit and beautiful stadium in New York should be proof enough, sigh, that it ain't the ballpark that wins or loses the games.
