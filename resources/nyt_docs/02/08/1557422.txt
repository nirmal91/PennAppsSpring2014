An article on Page 1 of the Real Estate section today about selling homes occupied by smokers includes a lawyer's erroneous reference to the policy of some co-op boards. Christopher Hitchcock, a lawyer for boards, originally said that some boards were banning smoking by new residents while allowing it by current owners. After the article had gone to press, Mr. Hitchcock was approached for a proposed article on boards that had done that. He then said that he had misstated the situation -- that while he knew of some boards that were considering such action, he did not know of any that had yet taken it.
