MAURICE CLARETT strode into a Manhattan hotel last week a happy young man, having taken down the last age barrier in professional sports -- the National Football League's rule that restricted its entry draft to players three years past their high school graduation.
But Clarett's legal victory over the N.F.L. will put him in the path of the very people largely responsible for keeping the rule in place for nearly 80 years: the punishing tacklers of the N.F.L.
At 6 feet, 230 pounds, and with only one season of experience at Ohio State, Clarett said he did not need the N.F.L.'s protection. He was one of the nation's top players as a freshman, before he was suspended for his entire sophomore season for violating N.C.A.A. rules about accepting extra benefits.
But many N.F.L. veterans say few players of Clarett's age, 20, could make it in a sport ruled by older men who outweigh them by 40 pounds at certain positions.
Clarett shrugged that off.
''Football is football,'' he said. ''It's just like high school to college and college to the pros. It's the same thing all over again.''
On Thursday, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the United States District Court in Manhattan agreed with Clarett, calling the N.F.L.'s rule an illegal restraint of trade. (The N.F.L. says it will appeal.)
If he had played any other sport, she ruled, he could have played professionally as soon as Ohio State suspended him.
The National Basketball Association's age limit was struck down more than 30 years ago. Major League Baseball has long been drafting players straight out of high school, as has the National Hockey League.
The N.F.L.'s rule, though, has gone largely unchallenged because few young men could imagine belonging in the league's brutal world.
Clarett believes he does. Only time, and tackling, will tell.
