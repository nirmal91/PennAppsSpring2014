Less than 24 hours after an unidentified gray powder was discovered leaking from an envelope at a postal distribution center in Wallingford last Monday night, the State Department of Public Health determined that the substance was not the deadly poison ricin.
Last Monday, ricin was found in the Washington office of the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist.
While the full battery of tests were still continuing Wednesday on the envelope that was addressed to Republican National Committee, it appeared that Wallingford had averted a repeat of 2001, when its postal facility transported an anthrax-contaminated letter that killed a 94-year-old Oxford woman.
''We don't like any of these things to occur, but our department is well-trained in these matters,'' said William W. Dickinson Jr., Wallingford's mayor. ''Maybe they've had too much practice.''
While postal officials stood outside last Tuesday briefing reporters on how the powder was handled, employees went about their normal day sorting mail, with only the direct area where the letter was discovered being cordoned off.
John Dirzius, president of the greater Connecticut American Postal Workers Union, said: ''My concern is, they shut the Senate building down, but not the workers here. Are we any different?''
But postal officials said they took every precaution, properly notifying employees and bringing in pubic health department physicians and law enforcement to investigate the area.
Lisa Bull, a spokeswoman with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New Haven office, said: ''I don't answer the phone after 10:30 at night unless the world is blowing up. And when my beeper started going off at 4 a.m., I was afraid something did blow up.''
