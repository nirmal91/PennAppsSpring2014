A member of an Afghan government team sent to investigate a disputed American airstrike last month confirmed Thursday in an interview that at least 10 people had been killed in the incident, among them two women and five children.
The United States military denied that any civilians died in the raid, which occurred Jan. 17 in the southern province of Uruzgan, but claimed to have killed five armed militants who were fleeing.
A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, said Friday that the American command had received only a six-line report from the government and was withholding comment until a fuller report was received.
The team member interviewed on Thursday, Colonel Saif-ur-Rahman, an Afghan police commander, wrote a five-page government report on the incident, which he showed to The New York Times. The colonel said the five-member Interior Ministry delegation saw six fresh graves -- for three men, two women and a child. Four more children, including a baby, are missing and presumed drowned in the river they were trying to cross when hit during the airstrike, he said.
Residents of Sawghataq, the village where the attack occurred, told the delegation that two more people had been killed, he said.
But the deaths could not be confirmed because the graves were some distance away, and the team spent only a few hours in the village because of the Taliban threat.
The local district chief, Abdul Rahman, reached by satellite telephone on Thursday, gave a slightly different account.
He said that 11 people had been killed, three couples and their children. One couple and a child had been buried in a different village, he said.
Colonel Hilferty has acknowledged that an AC-130 gunship fired on a group that night. Military spokesmen have said that video pictures of the incident taken from the air show a group of five men on the ground.
