To the Editor:
Yes, cellphone users can be annoying. They talk too loud, and their phones sometimes chirp unpleasantly for about 10 seconds. But how about those teenagers! They talk to each other! Such loud voices, such inane conversation and so embarrassingly personal. Let us not forget babies and little children. They cry, they have piping voices. Banish newspaper rattlers. But may I suggest earplugs? Or even tolerance? Public transportation comes with other people.
