The Babylon Zoning Board of Appeals has reaffirmed its decision to permit the construction of a Stew Leonard's grocery store opposite Republic Airport in Farmingdale, despite safety concerns raised by the airport and an aviation business association.
Steven C. Bellone, the Babylon supervisor, said construction would start as soon as the State Department of Transportation grants a permit for curb cuts in Route 110. The 130,000-square-foot store would be at Route 110 and Conklin Street.
Officials of the state-owned Republic Airport said it was an unacceptable risk to put the big-box store directly under the path of flights taking off or landing on one of Republic's two runways.
Mr. Bellone said one way to solve some of the airport's concerns would be to shorten the runway and thus prevent larger jets from landing.
Stewart Leonard Jr., president and chief executive of Stew Leonard's, agreed, saying, ''If the airport thinks it's such a risk, I would like them to shorten the runway.''
Mr. Leonard said he knew the area well because he was a pilot who received his instrument rating at Republic Airport.
''With any airplane activity around an airport there is obviously a risk,'' he said, ''But the F.A.A. said this is an approved airspace for us to build in, that it is not a hazard to navigation.''
