To the Editor:
Jesse Green suggested in his interview with Paul Rudnick [''Out &amp; Out,'' Feb. 1] that it would be a little hard for young gay people to read an allegory for themselves into ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' But it seems to me that it would be quite easy.
After all, ''Fiddler'' is in large part about how Tevye and Golde come to accept, after initial disapproval, the men whom their three oldest daughters have chosen as husbands (even if the acceptance is extremely tentative in one instance). ''Fiddler'' presents us with parents who ultimately accept their children's choices of mates even when those choices fly in the face of financial interest or religious beliefs. Many young gay people surely find much of ''Fiddler'' relevant to their lives, even if they do not consciously make the connections on a first viewing.
