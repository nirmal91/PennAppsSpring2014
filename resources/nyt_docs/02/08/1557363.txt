To the Editor:
Adam Clymer (''Sprinting to Victory,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 5) decries the speeded-up primary process as not offering voters in the states that follow Iowa and New Hampshire a long enough period to consider the candidates before them.
Apparently, he thinks that those of us who live in other states completely ignore the primary season until it marches down our own main street.
Has Mr. Clymer considered the possibility that many voters were waiting in ''undecided land'' until their candidate caught fire and found his voice? Once that happened with John Kerry, I was happy to sign on as a supporter.
