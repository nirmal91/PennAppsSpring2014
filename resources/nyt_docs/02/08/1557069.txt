My roommate and I stayed up for hours after reading Peter Landesman's article (Jan. 25). It made us feel angry, scared -- and helpless. As college students, we are activists by nature and training, and normally when an issue inflames us, we can go to a rally, write to our senators or volunteer a few hours, and we will feel as if we made a difference. But compared to the horrors described in your article, our usual concerns -- for abortion rights, affirmative action, the environment -- seem almost petty.
