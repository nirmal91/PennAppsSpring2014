Paul Fleischman's story THE ANIMAL HEDGE (Candlewick, $16.99; ages 5 to 9) is as simple as a folk song. Its illustrator, the Russian-born Bagram Ibatoulline, has followed the style of American folk painters of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and the result is as haunting as a loved melody. As the book opens, a farmer lives with his three sons in a peaceable kingdom of cows and chickens, pigs and sheep. His heart ''glowed like a hot wood stove'' with the love of animals; he and his boys sang as they worked. This idyll appears in ovals of color, set in sepia frames adorned with folk motifs, like a songbook or the pages of a family album. Then a drought comes. The pictures now glow with terrible heat, the animals' ribs show, and a heartbreaking little pig peers hopelessly at the bottom of a dry and empty wooden basin. The farmer is desolated; by the time rain and new growth return to the land, he has lost almost everything; the animals are gone, and the farmer has no money to buy more. He and his sons live in a tiny cottage, sharpening tools for a living. One day, preparing to trim his rough hedge, the farmer seems to discern the shapes of his vanished animals in his hedge and clips it to bring out their forms. Soon he is surrounded by green leafy cows, goats and sheep. The sweet and solemn story circles around until the farmer has back what was lost, the same but changed. The illustrations, apparently artless, are uncannily beautiful, filled with light and feeling.
