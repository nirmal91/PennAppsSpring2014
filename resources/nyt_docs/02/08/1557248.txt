The British police said Saturday that an investigation into the death of 19 Chinese immigrants who drowned in tidal surges while digging for shellfish in northwest England was leading them to the shadowy world of ''rogue'' work-gang masters in the Liverpool area.
Mick Gradwell, the deputy superintendent of detectives in Lancashire, said a number of investigative leads suggested that crew chiefs in that region had been transporting Chinese immigrants to the tidal flats of Morecambe Bay to cash in on soaring prices for cockles, mollusks that bring high prices in European restaurants.
''We are narrowing down the names of gang masters who might be responsible,'' he said at a news conference, adding that he expected arrests to be made ''within days rather than months.''
Cockle harvesting is common in the region, but local pickers have complained in recent years that gang masters, using immigrant labor and without obtaining licenses, have descended on the Morecambe Bay area with no regard to the safety or welfare of their workers.
''The fact that vulnerable people are being used to work in these circumstances for about one pound for a nine-hour shift I think is appalling,'' Mr. Gradwell said. A pound is worth about $1.85.
Fourteen of the Chinese workers and two people identified only as Europeans survived when the work gang of more than 30 was cut off by incoming tides racing across mud and quicksand flats. They were being cared for by social service officials at an undisclosed location, the police said, and questioning through interpreters was just getting under way.
''These people are victims,'' Julia Hodson, assistant chief constable in Lancashire, said, asking for public assistance in identifying the dead and the work-gang organization that put them at risk.
