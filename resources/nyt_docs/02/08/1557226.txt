To the Editor:
The column noted a Towers Perrin study from 2000 that showed how chief executives at big American companies made 531 times what their average hourly employees did, on average, versus a multiple of 57 in Brazil or 10 in Japan. I've never understood what value American C.E.O.'s add to deserve this kind of money. Shareholders should strongly consider this as a criterion before buying a stock.
