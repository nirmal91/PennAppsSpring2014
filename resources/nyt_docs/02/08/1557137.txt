To the Editor:
Re ''Lip Synching Gets Real'' by Chris Nelson [Feb. 1]:
Mr. Nelson quotes a Britney Spears fan as asking, ''Who can sing hanging on a harness upside-down?'' Actually, I saw Jane Krakowski do just that (and bring down the house in the process) last summer, in a performance of the Broadway musical ''Nine.'' She may have been miked, but there was no doubt that she was singing live.
