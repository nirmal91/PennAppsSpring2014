When the United States government gives more than $10 billion in subsidies to corn growers, it encourages them to produce a surplus that is then dumped onto world markets at artificially low prices. This has enormous consequences on the domestic economies of third-world nations.
In Mexico, the price of corn has dropped 70 percent while production costs have risen. Mexico, where corn occupies half of the total land used for growing crops, has lost most of its farms over the last 10 years, bringing havoc to the rural economy, forcing mass migration to the cities, bringing ruin and unemployment. And it has spurred the mass migration of campesinos to El Norte.
In small town and large, in every community across America these economic refugees from American corporate greed stand on street corners to try to get a day's pay doing work that no one else will do. They are resented in many communities. People see the downsizing, the unemployment, the foreclosures, the homelessness and bankruptcy as not so very far from them and blame these immigrants.
This is the social and economic context of Farmingville, a community of ordinary middle class and working Americans reeling from the larger forces of international trade rigged to the advantage of the privileged and the wealthy.
