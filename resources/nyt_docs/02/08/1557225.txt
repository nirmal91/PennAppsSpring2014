To the Editor:
Re ''Explaining (or Not) Why the Boss Is Paid So Much'' (Market Watch, Jan. 25), which viewed the pay of chief executives as a multiple of that of hourly workers:
Whether you are a welder, editor, movie idol or C.E.O., your pay, for the most part, is determined by two factors: the value of the economic contributions attributable to your abilities, and the availability of other people (or machines) that can generate comparable results.
As such, is paying Henry R. Silverman of Cendant a bonus $100,000 for each cent in earnings per share generated under his stewardship excessive in light of the fact that each penny equals earnings in excess of $10 million, which, under Cendant's price-to-earnings ratio, could raise shareholder value by more than $150 million? As a shareholder I would be happy to pay Mr. Silverman $1 of our $1,500 gain.
