GLADYS (woman in her late 20's, thick Jamaican accent): Thank you. My name is Gladys, and I am a poet/performer/playwright/spoken-word artist/actress. But I currently still have my regular job, and there are basically few career possibilities for people of Jamaican ancestry in this country. One is to become Secretary of State. Another is to take care of children or old people. This poem is entitled: ''First Year on the Job, Upper East Side.''
up and down fifth avenue
into the park and through it
we island gals like a flock of disoriented birds
with the scruff of white children in our beaks
our feet stirring the stew of our collective boiled dreams
while the mommies track play dates on palm pilots
but even with their feverish quests
for the perfect backhand
Most exclusive Pre-K
Most wrinkle-free forehead
best aligned chakras
there is still the hope all women share and store
in their fingertips
the lines around their mouths
and the whites of their eyes
there is the hope for something more like flying
than walking
something her children will have that
cannot be questioned or taken away
at the whim of a husband or employer
something she may only ever get to borrow
and tuck under her wing for a brief moment, beating
something close to how freedom feels
to the child who's been safely walked across the street
and now can let go
EXCERPT
