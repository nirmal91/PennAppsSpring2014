To the Sports Editor:
I read with interest of Pete Rose's admission of guilt concerning gambling on baseball. Although many of his reported comments might cause even his most dedicated fan to question his sincerity, why not give him the opportunity to be judged by a jury of his peers, i.e., the veterans committee?
It seems to me that the players Rose competed with and against, as well as those who competed before him, are the best authorities in this matter.
