A little red tugboat brings the reader along on a typical workday, crowing all the while about the skill, determination and, yes, might it takes to tow the big ships into port.
In many respects ''I'm Mighty!'' is conventional. What sets it apart is the tug's tart, wisecracking monologue -- equal parts Walt Whitman and Popeye the Sailor -- and the text, by Kate McMullan, invites readers to mimic the tugboat character's voice and manner.
She used a similar style of storytelling in ''I Stink!,'' the McMullans' portrait of a city garbage truck. The workplace here is a scruffy urban harbor similar to New York's, where the tug must ''nudge, bump, butt, shove, ram, push and pull'' three successively larger ships from the anchorage to the piers.
The tug is a grinning, childlike character, visibly dwarfed by the giant cargo ships, which seem only dimly aware of the sheer joy and vital importance of its efforts. Children may see something of themselves in the tug's boundless enthusiasm, not to mention his insatiable appetite for praise and encouragement.
Jim McMullan's illustrations are like circus posters -- boldly outlined cartoons, with clear geometries and uncluttered perspectives that add just the right amount of specificity and detail. The harbor is shipshape, but alive; there is the faintest suggestion of slickness on the water, and some ships look a little rusty. Type grows and shrinks, changes colors, leans forward and backward and wanders in and around the images, further enlivening the tug's vivid and extravagant banter.
By day's end, we see that the tugboat's self-regard is rooted in hard work, sustained effort and the willingness to master a small but important task in a busy and complicated world.
