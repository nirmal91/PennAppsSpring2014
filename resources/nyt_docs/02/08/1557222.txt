Wall Street firms are not supposed to tailor their investment recommendations to get investment banking business. But some companies evidently think they should.
At a Merrill Lynch pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference in New York last week, Katherine A. Martinelli, a Merrill Lynch analyst, introduced Dane A. Miller, the president and chief executive of Biomet, a large biotechnology company. She offered the standard disclosure that is now required of analysts, saying listeners ''should assume that we either have or are seeking an investment banking relationship with Biomet.''
To which Mr. Miller responded: ''Thank you Katherine. I'd like to point out that the likelihood of an investment banking relationship until they upgrade their rating is pretty close to zero.''
Merrill's current rating on Biomet is neutral. It downgraded the rating from buy in the spring of 2003.
Obviously, Mr. Miller isn't afraid to say what's on his mind, and he didn't stop there. Before discussing business, he told a tale about an elevator ride he said he had taken that morning at the Grand Hyatt hotel, where the conference was held. By his account, ''there was an older gal in the back of the elevator I noticed when I got on.'' Both of them watched as two attractive young women got on and off the elevator, he said. Each of the younger women, without being asked, provided the name and price of her perfume, the most expensive being $150 an ounce.
''We got to the older lady's floor,'' Mr. Miller said, ''and, as she got off the elevator, she paused and passed gas and said, 'Broccoli, 49 cents a pound.'''
On a tape recording of the conference on a Merrill Lynch Web site, a couple of strained laughs were heard from the audience.
Mr. Miller did not return a phone call seeking comment. A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman said Merrill had never done any investment banking business with Biomet and said that Ms. Martinelli did not wish to comment.
