To the Sports Editor:
Ruling that the N.F.L. may not exclude Maurice Clarett from its draft, Judge Shira Scheindlin has brilliantly revealed antitrust's real power (''N.F.L. Ordered to Let Young Athletes Enter Its Draft,'' Feb. 6).
I am skeptical of this particular application of this newfound power, but I thrill when I contemplate the many truly uncompetitive rules that will crumble under consistent application of Scheindlin's logic. The New York City Taxi Commission will be obliged to issue a medallion to anyone who asks. Likewise, lack of a license will no longer prevent anyone from seeking work as a physician, dentist, lawyer, electrician, plumber, hairdresser or undertaker.
I hope that courts don't punt on extending Scheindlin's logic into areas where it will do genuine good.
