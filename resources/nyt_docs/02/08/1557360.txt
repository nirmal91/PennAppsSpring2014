To the Editor:
The Republican Party line on John Kerry, that he is too liberal and ''out of step'' with mainstream America, is pathetic (Political Memo, front page, Feb. 5).
I'm no fan of either John Kerry or George W. Bush. But Senator Kerry's main weakness is that he supported Mr. Bush's Patriot Act, endorsed the Iraq invasion and endorsed Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind law, which is a burden to our states and schools.
The cynicism that Ed Gillespie, the Republican chairman, displays toward the American voter is remarkable.
