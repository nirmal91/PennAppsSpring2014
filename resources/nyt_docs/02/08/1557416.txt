The County Lines column last Sunday misstated the name of a soup kitchen in Peekskill and described its sponsorship incorrectly. The soup kitchen, which is at the English-Spanish Tabernacle of Christ Assembly of God Church in Peekskill, is known as the Peekskill Area Lunchtime Feeding Program. It is financed by St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Peekskill, with donated food and volunteer labor from 18 other organizations and churches. Its building was refurbished by AmeriCares, a Stamford-based charity, with the help of community volunteers. It was not organized by AmeriCorps volunteers with donations from 30 different area churches.
