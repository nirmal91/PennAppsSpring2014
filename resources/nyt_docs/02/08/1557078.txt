Our creative culture did not suffer a setback when Diebold Election Systems asserted rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and demanded that Swarthmore students take down 15,000 Diebold e-mails and memos from the school server.
Posting 15,000 documents is an information dump. Selecting 500 of the most telling documents to post online could meet fair-use, journalistic standards under the law. It also would have been an artistic expression worth defending. Technology has the potential to foster artistic laziness. Hence, one reason for strong intellectual-property protection on the Internet.
