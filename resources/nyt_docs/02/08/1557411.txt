I read with sheer amazement Roger Mummert's Out of Order column ''Our Goldendoodle, a Breed Apart'' [Jan.18]. As any person who is truly involved with dogs knows the poodle is not the most common mix -- the German shepherd is. All one has to do to convince oneself of this fact is to visit your local shelter or simply scroll through petfinder.com to see the millions of shepherd mixes, most of whom are being euthanized after languishing in our shelters.
You don't have to travel by airplane or ''pay in the four figures'' to own one. All you have to do is go to your neighborhood shelter and save a life.
