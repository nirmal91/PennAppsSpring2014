The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last week that prosecutors who plan to seek the death penalty must first present evidence to support a death sentence to a grand jury as part of the indictment process. Until now, a prosecutor could simply obtain an indictment for murder, making no mention of the death penalty to grand jurors, and decide later to argue for the death penalty on the basis of aggravating circumstances. But on Tuesday, the court increased the state's burden in capital cases, as it has done for a decade. New Jersey reinstated the death penalty in 1982 but has yet to execute an inmate.
The decision, in which the court overturned the conviction of a death-row inmate, raised the prospect of grand jurors who opposed the death penalty refusing to indict. ''I can see a grand juror saying, 'If I vote for this I'm authorizing a death penalty case,''' said David A. Ruhnke, a lawyer who has handled capital cases. Prosecutors and defense lawyers said it was not clear whether a prosecutor would have to explicitly tell a grand jury that he would seek the death penalty or whether he might simply present all the evidence that he planned to use later.
The New Jersey attorney general, Peter C. Harvey, said that ''prosecutors are going to have to make decisions about seeking the death penalty much sooner in the process.''
While the prosecution must now seek a new indictment against the death row inmate, Steven R. Fortin, whose murder conviction was overturned on other grounds, the court said its new rule would apply only to future prosecutions and not to the 13 other men on death row.
