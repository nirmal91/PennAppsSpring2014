To the Editor:
Those who try to disparage their fellow citizens with labels like ''Northeastern liberal'' (Political Memo, front page, Feb. 5) seem to have forgotten that untold numbers of Northeastern liberals lost their lives on Sept. 11.
Our enemies don't care about our home addresses or party registration, so it's about time that Republicans stopped dividing America along those lines, too.
