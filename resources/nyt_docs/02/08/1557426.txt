To the Editor:
Regarding the Soapbox: ''A Little Quiet, Please (Actually, a Lot),'' Feb. 1, by Hubert B. Herring: Stop complaining. If you are unhappy, take the car to the city.
Furthermore, you were disingenuous as to the statistic that 27 percent of Metro-North riders favor phone-free cars. You say, ''That's an awful lot of unhappy riders.'' Who said they are ''unhappy''? The question on the survey asked only if they preferred phone-free cars, not the state of their happiness. My cellphone is always off when I'm on public transportation.
