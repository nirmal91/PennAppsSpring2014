I was deeply disturbed by your report on sex slavery and have been able to think of little else since reading it. What can we as concerned citizens and proponents of human rights do about this atrocity? There must be something!
Please extend my deepest thanks to Peter Landesman for bringing this issue to the forefront. I believe that this kind of reporting can empower us.
