To the Editor: ''For 2 Ships: Goodbye, New York. Hello, Bayonne'' (Travel Advisory, Jan. 4) brought back fond memories of the former Military Ocean Terminal and the Bayonne Navy Base.
I grew up in Bayonne during the 1940's and 50's. The base was open to visitors only on July 4. Families were allowed on the aircraft carriers for this once-a-year inspection. From time to time, there were even professional wrestling matches, which drew big crowds.
Although not filmed in Bayonne, the movie ''Men of Honor'' told the true story of the base as a training center for Navy divers during World War II.
