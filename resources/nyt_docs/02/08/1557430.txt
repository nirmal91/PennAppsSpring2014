To the Editor:
A number of your letter writers (Letters column, Feb. 1, in response to ''What's the Problem, Officer?'' Jan. 18) seem to forget that in highway speed, as with so many things in this country, the ''market'' will ultimately determine what is reasonable behavior.
On frequent trips on the county's highways and parkways, I find that there is much less danger from those traveling at the ''market rate,'' than there is from the self-appointed ''speed guardians'' who cause traffic to bunch up while cars try to get around them.
