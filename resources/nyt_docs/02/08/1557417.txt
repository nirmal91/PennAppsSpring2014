An article on Jan. 18 about speeding in Westchester misstated figures for speeding summonses issued in Rye. They increased by more than 9 percent in 2002 over 2001; they did not rise to almost twice as many in 2002.
The article also referred incorrectly to Rye's hiring of its first full-time officer for conducting radar patrols; the officer was already on the force, and was reassigned to radar patrols last summer from other duties.
