THE FOREST LOVER
By Susan Vreeland.
Viking, $24.95.
The Canadian artist Emily Carr (1871-1945) so loved the native people and lands of British Columbia that she strove to depict them in a new way: emotionally. Her Expressionistic paintings went beyond anthropology to evoke the awe of encountering artifacts like totem poles in their original setting. Sometimes, however, an artist can get too close to her subject. The novelist Susan Vreeland so loves Emily Carr that she fashions her into a feminist New Age icon, a woman who runs with the trees. Her novel begins with the artist in middle age, embarking on her first expedition to paint native subjects. By Chapter 2, she's already discovered a menstrual hut and an American Indian girl who says ''Everything is one.'' More worrying is how Vreeland, the author of ''Girl in Hyacinth Blue,'' tends to fetishize not the life of the artist but the artist's lifestyle. Hence, we get a careful note of the asperges d'Argenteuil that Carr eats in Paris, but only a few allusions to the many years in which she did not work for lack of encouragement and money. Other aspects of Carr's life that seem murky, such as her lack of male companionship, get papered over. Vreeland concocts a brief affair with a dashing French trapper -- unconsummated, as he just rubs ointment on Carr's mosquito bites while telling her that art is her true passion. Later, there's an awkward scene where Carr appears to have a sexual encounter with a grove of cedars. Episodes like this underscore the novel's rampant sensitivity and superficiality. Vreeland's admiring prose portrait of Carr may be full of color, but it lacks perspective.
