Residents of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow narrowly defeated a hotly contested $98 million bond issue last week.
The Public Schools of the Tarrytowns had requested the money for the renovation of four of the district's schools, with a fifth to be closed.
The plan would have provided enough money to install a new roof, windows, plumbing, heating and electrical systems at four schools, and to add classrooms. Because of the uncertain future of several large development projects in Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown, school officials were unable to provide exact figures for the size of increases in school taxes.
''Now we have to tease out the facts, regroup, and decide where we go from here,'' said Schools Superintendent Howard W. Smith.
The final vote was 1,189 against the bond referendum and 995 in favor. The large number of votes, more than 2,000, was three times the number cast in any single budget vote during the past five years, according to Jane Appelle, the district clerk.
The school district has not requested a sizable bond referendum in decades, with the exception of a $1.5 million bond issue in 1996, which drew slightly more than 1,300 voters.
Although Mr. Smith said that he had no immediate plans to put forward another bond proposal, the school board must continue to prepare its forthcoming budget proposal for May 18, the date set by New York State.
In the meantime, he said, ''we have to figure out separate funding for our short-term needs, in addition to exploring long-term alternatives.''
The district needs to make immediate plans to accommodate a large incoming seventh-grade class this fall, which significantly outnumbers the size of the graduating senior class, Mr. Smith said.
