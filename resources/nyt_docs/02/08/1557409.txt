Re ''Saving the Day for Those Brides in Need'' Feb. 1]: Boo hoo for the bride who ''grew up in a certain lifestyle'' and can't afford a $10,000 wedding gown or a $75,000 reception. There are too many families on Long Island who are having trouble feeding their children and keeping their homes warm this winter.
Nicole Gleitman, who is helping people to have weddings they can't afford, has her heart in the right place. But I'd like to see her efforts redirected toward deserving families with children and not selfish brides, grooms and their families.
