To the Editor:
Now that the Salvation Army is requiring its social service staff to advance its Christian mission (news article, Feb. 2), there are two implications to be concerned about.
First, social workers are likely to find that they cannot continue to work in their administrative and supervisory roles, since the profession's code of ethics prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of religion and sexual orientation. This will lead to a loss of expertise and diminished quality of services.
Second, since services are provided under contract on behalf of the city, it will be our government, by extension, that will be engaging in religious practices if this relationship is allowed to continue.
