Socks and lox? To pass the time on Sunday while waiting for the Super Bowl to start, Knit New York, a coffee bar and knitting shop, offered four hours of knitting and snacking. Knitters and munchers paid $75 each for two balls of hand-dyed yarn, knitting needles, instructions for knitting a pair of socks and bagels and lox.
Miriam Maltagliati, the owner of the store and head knitting teacher there, said she planned to repeat the session every other Sunday morning. ''Knitting is a group activity,'' Ms. Maltagliati said. ''And it's fashion you make yourself.'' For those who don't want to knit, the coffee bar, on one side of the store opposite a wall of colorful yarn, sells coffee, pastries and sandwiches.
The cafe is open from 7:30 a.m. until 9 p.m.; the knitting store opens at 10 a.m. Private lessons are $50 an hour; a series of three group lessons, two-and-a-half hours each, with practice yarn, needles and enough yarn to make a scarf is $175. Knit New York will start a Web site and mail-order yarn business in early spring. The store is at 307 East 14th Street (Second Avenue), (212) 387-0707.
