Marc Aronson's ''Witch-Hunt: Mysteries of the Salem Witch Trials,'' a highly readable narrative, dramatizes the old story and interweaves new historical interpretations. Aronson tries to help readers understand the enchanted world of the 17th century and the way fear and faith produced not caution and mercy but a contagious desire to punish. He sets the tale in the context of what the historian Richard Hofstadter called the paranoid style in our political history. Aronson's interventions cannot make the events in Salem exactly transparent, but he evokes the ways that incomprehension coupled with increasing terror can make us betray our legal safeguards and, ultimately, our better selves.
Aronson establishes essential historical context deftly -- a sudden and destabilizing political vacuum in colonial Massachusetts; violent strife between European settlers and Indians on the colony's northern border; and the growing divide in Salem between an economically dynamic, increasingly secular merchant class who supplied most of the accused and a poorer, more traditional agricultural sector, from among whose members came most of the accusers.
There is background and motivation for familiar characters like the Indian (not black) slave, Tituba; the young accusers, Betty Parris, Abigail Williams and the sinister and potent 12-year-old Ann Putnam; and a portrait of the ghostbusting Cotton Mather as a young man. The judges' willingness to believe wild young women with unsubstantiated stories and unseen demons, the mounting number of executions, the moral struggles of the accused between protecting their lives and serving the truth are vividly told. While Aronson offers a number of recent historians' insights, the process through which the fear of evil shifted shape into evil itself remains ultimately, and tragically, intractable to reason.
