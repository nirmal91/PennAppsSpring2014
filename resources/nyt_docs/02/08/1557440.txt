To the Sports Editor:
As the former coach of Evelyn Ashford, a four-time Olympian and former world-record holder in the 100 meters, and currently the coach of 18-year-old Allyson Felix, I object to the statements by Charles Yesalis in ''Jones Is Testing Her Credibility and Her Speed'' (Feb. 4).
''Whatever all-American-girl image she had, none of them have it anymore,'' Yesalis said. ''Tell me which rose has the bloom yet to come off of.''
Not one of Marion Jones's performances to date is out of line with what intelligent coaches would predict for her to achieve without the use of performance-enhancing drugs. I have seen drug-enhanced performances, but Jones has done nothing more than I would expect from her natural talent.
Further, there are many ''roses'' blooming and flowering nicely, with hard work and patience and no banned performance-enhancing drugs. Felix is one; just watch for the next eight years. Her talent, like that of Ashford, Wyomia Tyus, Wilma Rudolph and Fanny Blankers, needs no drug enhancement.
