To the Editor: Claudia Rowe's experience at the House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wis. (''Changing Coasts, on a Solo Drive,'' Jan. 11) made me feel lucky to have visited much earlier.
On a camping trip with my husband in 1961, we thought that we had reached our destination, Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin East, when we saw a very unusual structure. The name House on the Rock was on a small sign, but nothing indicated that it was open to the public. The owner came out and invited us in to see it. The many rooms wending around were relatively bare, except for built-in furniture. It was cozy, but the view straight down from a cantilevered window was unnerving.
That was the last I heard of it until I saw the article.
