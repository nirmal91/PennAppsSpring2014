To the Editor: I have done four home exchanges in the past year and a half and I thought ''Trading Spaces in a Home Swap'' (Practical Traveler, Jan. 25) was filled with the salient points of doing an exchange.
I am 76 years old, and single, and found home exchange beneficial in one aspect: I suffer from jet lag. It usually takes me three or four days to recover, especially going east. When I traveled before, I would go out of the hotel feeling dreadful, but since it was costing me so much a day, I felt I had to ''do something.'' Now I do a home exchange for at least three weeks -- one week to recover from the jet lag and two or three to explore.
Like most exchangers, I make sure my two-bedroom apartment is clean. But when I exchanged with a Danish couple, my neighbor (acting as my contact) told me that they were furiously cleaning my bathroom. I thought it was clean.
Also, a Dutch exchange couple moved my furniture to fit their needs, and I was annoyed at first. Then I realized that I preferred their arrangement and have kept it.
