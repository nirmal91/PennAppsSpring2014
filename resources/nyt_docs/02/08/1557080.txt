As a fan of both classical music and football, I often mute the volume and play serious music as a soundtrack to the game (Susan Ryan Jordan, The Way We Live Now, Jan. 25). The effect is surprisingly satisfying, as my wife, who is not a football fan, conceded.
Big orchestral pieces (including Rachmaninoff) work best. It's amazing how often, say, an extended crescendo in the winds and brass will nicely underscore a third-and-long rollout play.
As a bonus, the inanities of network commentators, generally irritating to novice and veteran sports fans alike, are eliminated.
I urge the Jordans to give it a try.
