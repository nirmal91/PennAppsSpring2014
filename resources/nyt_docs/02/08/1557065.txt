Is the next Missy Elliott now attending Princess Anne High? Judging from this small survey of juniors and seniors, music is what rocks their world, up there with clothes, surfing and skateboarding. The girls like hip-hop labels like Rocawear and Baby Phat. The guys are more generic. Their style is ''laid back'' ''chill mode.'' They all have a picture of what they'll be doing in five years. And maybe because they make mostly A's and B's, angst is not high on their agenda. So who are their favorites? The Neptunes and 50 Cent and Missy Elliott. No surprise there. But they also love Red Hot Chili Peppers, Moby, Kurt Cobain and -- are you ready, Grandpa? -- Paul McCartney.
