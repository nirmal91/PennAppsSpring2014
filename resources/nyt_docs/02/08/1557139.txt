To the Editor:
Michael Kimmelman attributes what he perceives as the superiority of Santiago Calatrava's PATH terminal design to that of Michael Arad and Peter Walker's ground zero memorial to the selection process. The memorial designers, he notes, were chosen in an open competition; the PATH designer was carefully selected by the Port Authority from a short list of architects with station design expertise. What he does not mention is that one group had an unprecedented challenge, the other a familiar brief.
A work of architecture achieves excellence by giving an understandable form to a program whose meanings, however contradictory, have been established. A train station gathers the multitudes together and connects them to far-flung places. The power inherent in this simple act has been celebrated successfully in stations many times before, often with dramatic steel and glass structures not unlike those Mr. Calatrava has proposed.
The memorial is something quite new. There is hardly a cultural consensus about what meanings it should convey, or a commonly understood architectural language with which to convey them. Mr. Calatrava was able to build on 150 years of precedents to celebrate a technological marvel. The 5,201 memorial competitors had to invent a new way to convey feelings of unspeakable grief -- a somewhat more difficult request.
