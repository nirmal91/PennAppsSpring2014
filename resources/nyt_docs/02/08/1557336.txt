An enduring image of romance is a couple kissing on the deck of an ocean liner gliding over moonlit waves. For those who can't afford that, there is always the ferry across the Hudson.
At least that's what those old romantics at New York Waterway thought when they began a Valentine's Day promotion last month looking for couples who had met on any of the line's 23 ferry routes and become engaged or married.
One woman sent a e-mail account of how her fianc√© proposed to her as she was getting off the ferry in Jersey City. A Manhattan man looking for a waterfront apartment on the Jersey side said he had met a woman who volunteered to help him look for a place to live and found a wife in the bargain.
And Lynn Madsen of Lincoln Park had a moment that changed her life.
''My husband, Matt, first told me he loved me on the upper deck of the NY Waterway ferry after we returned from seeing a play on Broadway,'' Ms. Madsen wrote. ''It was a very romantic, balmy summer evening, and we were enjoying the lights of the Manhattan skyline.''
The prize for the best stories are ''a romantic dinner for two'' on Valentine's Day at Arthur's Landing or Spirito Grill, both in Weehawken, and free commuting for a month.
But maybe romance itself is reward enough. Nicholas Thorp wrote that when he and his wife, Anita, moved from Paris, they looked for a waterfront apartment in New Jersey so they could ride the ferry to work in Manhattan and arrange to meet each evening for the ride home.
''We often stand on the upper deck in each other's arms, admiring the Manhattan backdrop and stealing the occasional kiss,'' Mr. Thorp wrote. ''We look forward to this romantic trip at the end of each day. It reminds us of Paris.''
Or as Bogie might have said it, ''We'll always have the ferry.''
