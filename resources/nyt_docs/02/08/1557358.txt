To the Editor:
In ''G.O.P. Revives Line of Attack Against Kerry'' (Political Memo, front page, Feb. 5), Ed Gillespie, the Republican chairman, denounces John Kerry as ''out of sync'' and ''culturally out of step with the rest of America.''
People in glass houses should not throw stones.
His candidate, George W. Bush, is undoubtedly the most radical president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr. Bush is out of step with most people in his disdain for the environment, in his inequitable tax cuts, and for the Patriot Act, which diminishes the constitutional rights of every American.
Even many of his most conservative supporters have begun to question his reckless expanding deficits.
No less radical is Mr. Bush's unilateralist foreign policy, his pre-emptive war doctrine and his stumbling efforts at nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.
All of these policies belie his own conservative campaign promises.
