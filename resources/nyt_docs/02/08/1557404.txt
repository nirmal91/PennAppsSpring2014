Two events to help benefit New Haven area residents who have cancer are taking place today.
A group called ''Friends of Annette'' is holding a bone marrow drive for people of African-American ancestry from noon to 5 p.m. today at Trinity Church on the Green at the corner of Temple Street and Chapel Street in New Haven.
The group is hoping to attract 1,000 potential donors from ages 18 to 60. The event will benefit Annette Windom, 51, of New Haven, a local pharmacist and mother of two teenagers who is in the early stage of acute myelocytic leukemia; and Renina Trammell, 14, of Hamden, who also has leukemia. Both are African-American.
Debby Kraemer, a spokeswoman for the group, said the American Red Cross was waiving its $25 fee for each test and would cover the cost with grant money. She said everyone tested would be listed in the National Bone Marrow Registry.
''Getting people into the registry will eventually benefit these two individuals, but it is also very important because African-Americans are underrepresented in the National Bone Marrow Registry,'' she said.
The National Marrow Donor Program said that potential recipients have the best chance of finding a match through a family member or members of the same race or ethnicity.
Antonio Boanno, 56, of West Haven, also has cancer, and to help cover medical expenses, his friends and family are holding two fund-raisers in the next two weeks.
Penny Margansky, a relative of Mr. Boanno, and her employees will be cutting hair for a $10 donation from 3 to 7 p.m. today at Scissors-Hair by Penny and Company, at 314 Main Street in Ansonia.
There will also be a dinner for Mr. Boanno on Feb. 15 at the Catholic War Veterans, St. Michael's Post 1562, at 112 Derby Avenue in Derby from noon to 7 p.m.
Tickets are $20 for adults and $10 for children under 13. Children under 5 are free.
