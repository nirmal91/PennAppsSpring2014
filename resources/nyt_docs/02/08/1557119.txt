An answer in the Q&amp;A column on Jan. 25 about Bloomsday tours to Dublin misidentified a stop on the Back-Roads Touring Company's literary tour. It is Inishmore, one of the Aran Islands of County Galway -- not Aran Island, farther north, in Donegal. The answer also misspelled the name of the poet whose home was at another tour stop, Thoor Ballylee. He was W.B. Yeats, not Yates.
