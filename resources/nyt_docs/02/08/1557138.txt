To the Editor:
Although I was the author of one of the 5,201 designs submitted for the ground zero memorial, I nevertheless find myself in complete agreement with Michael Kimmelman's thoughts on the selection process [''Ground Zero Finally Grows Up,'' Feb. 1]. Inspired visual ideas and superb design will in the long run trump democracy every time. But I also feel compelled to mention that it wasn't until I spent the better part of last May and June working alone night and day, calling upon all that I'd absorbed in nearly 30 years of art practice, that I was able to put Sept. 11 behind me (or as far behind me as is possible for someone who calls this city home).
It is ironic that the process that seems not to have yielded the inspired design we hoped for, initiated, in me, at least, exactly what we would hope Mr. Arad and Mr. Walker's design would inspire. I am grateful to have been a part of that process, and I suspect that for a small segment of our community, the real healing began on the surface of a 120-square-inch board.
