Jerry's Gourmet Foods is a large Italian market, at 7,000 square feet, but it is so packed with specialty products, good smells and people poking around that you still think you're in the corner store.
Jerry Turci, the owner, also has a restaurant, Jerry's Gourmet Osteria, in Tenafly. He started in the perfume business in New York City 30 years ago and determined that what everyone really wanted was good Italian food at decent prices. And he thought New Jersey was ready for it.
Though his market has everything from fresh foods, baked goods, gift baskets, dried pastas, cheeses from around the world and aisles of products ranging from wine to cookbooks, cooking implements and large pottery platters, he still has one section of perfume and cosmetic products, because, he said, ''those are my roots.''
The Jerry's label is everywhere. Jerry's sauce ($5.99 a jar) is made fresh and comes in several flavors. He has 33 kinds of his brand of fresh ravioli ($2.99 to $5.99), from standards like ricotta or chicken to porcini mushroom, artichoke, roasted garlic and goat cheese. Or say you want olives, Jerry stuffs his own ($3.99 to $7.99 a pound). Even his mozzarella ($4.99 a pound) is made fresh every few hours.
His brother-in-law, Vito Fadda, a chef for 55 years before he retired, comes from the Amalfi coast to Jerry's for three months each year and trains the new employees so that they will all have an ''Italian hand.''
Late last year, Mr. Turci opened a store in Vero Beach, Fla., that is even larger, at 12,000 square feet.
The people down there ''don't know this food yet,'' he said, ''but they will.''
No doubt.
