The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is considering a change in regulations that would make the developers pay full costs for extending gas, water and power lines to housing developments placed in rural areas. Under current regulations, developers pay a portion of the costs for additions made to the lines, but are later reimbursed. State officials said the proposal was intended to bring utility rules in line with the state's Development and Redevelopment plan, which was created to help curb suburban sprawl. In cases of urban redevelopment and other approved areas, however, some of the proposal's guidelines could be waived.
