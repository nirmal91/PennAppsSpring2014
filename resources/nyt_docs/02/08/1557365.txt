To the Editor:
Re ''Film Makes SAT Villain, and Students Can Relate'' (Education page, Feb. 4):
At first glance, the movie ''The Perfect Score'' looks implausible, absurd and not even particularly amusing. But as a high school senior undergoing the long months of waiting until April college decisions, I found a seed planted in my head -- what if there was some area of college admissions I could control?
It is a problem larger than just standardized tests. Augmenting the pressure to get into a university that any parent would be proud to display on a bumper sticker is the fact that college admission has evolved to a level where only students who have won a Nobel Prize or cured cancer can feel secure about being accepted to the school of their choice. And at Texas A&amp;M, even being a legacy won't cut it.
