Robert S. Boynton (Jan. 25) writes that the Copy Left proponents wish to shorten current copyright longevity in order to allow ''successive . . . creators to draw freely on earlier ideas.'' What is he saying, that these people think they must wait till a copyright expires before expounding on the idea or the theme of a work? Nonsense. They can do that now, freely.
Anyway, my thanks to Robert Boynton. I had wondered where all the old tenure-protected Marxists were going to surface. It's good to see them again, defending their new set of file-shared, Napster-erected barricades, chanting, ''Music to the people!''
