Re ''Broken Hoop Dreams for the Basketball Players of Coney Island,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Feb. 1):
Eons from now, when archaeologists are chipping away at remnants of a society long gone, trying to determine what went wrong, they will discover a perplexing disparity in how the citizens of that society were remunerated in comparison with their role in contributing to its support and advancement.
Individuals with little education and blessed with exquisite but limited skills in athletics or with a talent of dubious quality were rewarded with vast fortunes beyond belief, while others whose efforts provided the supporting pillars for that society all too often struggled to make ends meet.
Where on earth are our priorities?
