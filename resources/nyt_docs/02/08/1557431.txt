To the Editor:
It was encouraging to read about the religious education geared to children with severe learning or developmental disabilities (In the Schools column: ''Religious Instruction Meeting Special Needs,'' Feb. 1). Many parents whose children are in my pediatric occupational therapy practice often express concerns about meeting this need. However, what was not mentioned in this article is the manner in which the Solomon Schecter School in White Plains goes about meeting the needs of children with much less severe learning or other developmental disabilities, whose parents want their children to attend Solomon Schecter rather than public school on a daily basis.
I know these children well, having seen many of them in therapy for extended periods of time, in addition to visiting their classrooms and maintaining regular contact with their teachers. Many of these children are appropriate candidates for mainstream education.
While providing alternative education for those children who cannot function at their optimal level in a mainstream class is admirable, it is but a first step. We must encourage schools like Schecter to take the next step, full inclusion for children who may need some ''special'' help, but who belong in the mainstream despite some learning or social ''differences.''
It is one thing to teach kindness and acceptance of differences, but if we continue to segregate these children from the classrooms of their typical peers these lessons become empty words.
