To the Editor:
I noticed that the G.O.P. has been calling John Kerry a Massachusetts liberal, instead of the usual ''tax and spend'' label they foist on Democrats (Political Memo, front page, Feb. 5).
I guess that label doesn't hold water when the G.O.P. has a ''tax-cut and spend'' president, a Republican-controlled Congress and a $521 billion single-year budget deficit.
