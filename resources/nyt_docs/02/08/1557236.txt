To the Editor:
As a former student and teacher at Stuyvesant High School, I enjoyed your article ''Arabic Is in the News. How About at Stuyvesant?'' (Feb 1). In this mosaic of a city, we need to study the many cultures in our midst.
At a time when the teaching of Hebrew at Stuyvesant has been threatened, let us have both languages -- minus religious rancor. Study of the Koran, however, breaches the wall of separation of church and state.
