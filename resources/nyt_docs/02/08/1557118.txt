Two spring excursions give wildlife enthusiasts the chance to observe animals in their natural environment.
''Paradise and Predators,'' a five-night trip to Yellowstone National Park, focuses on the social interactions and hunting techniques of wolves while also viewing coyotes, ravens, elk, bison and other animals. Led by a biologist, the trip starts in Bozeman, Mont., and travels through Yellowstone, visiting Gardner Canyon, Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Paradise Valley before returning to Bozeman.
Wildlife Expeditions, a division of the Teton Science School of Jackson Hole, Wyo., is offering the program March 6 to 11 and March 13 to 18. The cost is $2,395 a person, based on double occupancy, and includes hotel for five nights, some meals and park entrance fees. Air fare to Bozeman is not included.

On the Environmental Adventure Company's trip, ''Bears, Birds and Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains,'' participants are joined by biologists and naturalists. The three-night excursion to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park investigates the park's rich diversity of flora and fauna during the peak wildflower season. With more than 4,000 species of plants, the park is an International Biosphere Reserve and has been designated a World Heritage Site for its rich cultural history. The program, which starts in Knoxville, Tenn., examines the ecology of the park with emphasis on the population of black bears, including the opportunity to observe them forage in meadows.
The company, based in Livingston, Mont., is offering the excursion April 15 to 18 and April 22 to 25 at the cost of $995 a person, based on double occupancy, and includes hotel for three nights and all meals. Air fare to Knoxville is not included.
