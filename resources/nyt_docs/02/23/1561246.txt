A report in the Metro Briefing column on Dec. 12 about a judge's finding that Joel B. Steinberg was liable for $15 million in damages to the birth mother of Lisa Steinberg, the 6-year-old girl he beat to death in 1987, misstated his legal relationship to the girl. He and his companion, Hedda Nussbaum, reared her from infancy without filing adoption papers; he was not her adoptive father. A reader reported the error on Feb. 10, and this correction was delayed for legal research.
