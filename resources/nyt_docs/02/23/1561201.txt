North Carolina Speedway has been home to Nascar's Cup series competition since 1965, but it may not remain on the schedule much longer as races continue to be shifted away from the South to larger markets.
The speedway lost one of its two annual races this year when Nascar officials realigned the schedule and moved the annual November race date to Darlington Raceway and gave a second race to California Speedway in Fontana near Los Angeles.
Now, there is talk that North Carolina Speedway will lose its lone race next year. Nascar's president, Mike Helton, gave no assurances that Rockingham will remain on the schedule.
''We just now begun working on the '05 schedule and we'll see what the '05 schedule brings,'' he said. ''I'm not saying, because I don't know.''
Some drivers do not want Rockingham to lose its race date, although they are realistic. The Subway 400 was not a sellout at the Speedway, which seats a little more than 60,000.
''It's a tough call because as a driver I like this racetrack,'' Jeff Gordon said. ''But you look in the grandstands and there are empty seats. You look at the markets that are out there that maybe we could be in or others that we could be going to twice and what's good for the sport.''
