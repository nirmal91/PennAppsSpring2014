A gunman attacked a helicopter as it was preparing to take off from a health clinic in southern Afghanistan on Sunday, killing the pilot and wounding three passengers employed by the American construction company Louis Berger.
The attack had the hallmarks of the Taliban, as a lone gunman opened fire with an automatic rifle, witnesses said. The attack took place in the village of Toloqan, 25 miles west of the city of Kandahar.
The Louis Berger team consisted of three non-Afghans, one of them an American woman, and an Afghan translator. The pilot was British or Australian, a United States Embassy official said. The third non-Afghan was armed and might have been a security guard, a witness said.
An American military spokesman confirmed the attack and the casualties, and said the wounded had been evacuated to the American air base at Bagram. A quick-reaction air and ground force was sent to the scene and sealed off the area, Lt. Col. Matthew P. Beevers said.
Louis Berger has been building the biggest American-supported project in Afghanistan, the $250 million road from Kabul to Kandahar. It also has been building schools and clinics in the capital and in rural areas.
An Afghan driver who saw the shooting said the attack occurred at about 10 a.m. The team arrived by helicopter, landing close to the health clinic and the village school. ''They had a video camera and were taking pictures,'' the driver said. He and another witness spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were afraid of repercussions.
After 15 to 20 minutes, the Louis Berger team climbed aboard the helicopter, the witnesses said. Before it was to lift off, a gunman opened fire from a distance of 60 yards, according to the witnesses.
''I saw the woman open the door and fall down,'' one witness said. ''When she fell down, he continued shooting at her.''
