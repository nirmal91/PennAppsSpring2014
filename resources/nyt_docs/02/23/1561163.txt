IT doesn't seem quite fair that the grownups who pay for mobile video hardly ever get to watch it. That is probably just as well, though, in the interest of driving safety.
Despite what might seem logical, no federal law prohibits installation of a video screen where the driver can view it. Still, said Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, driving while distracted is a very bad idea, and many states have laws prohibiting drivers from simultaneously viewing videos with the children.
Many electronics manufacturers make in-dash video units with retractable screens. While the car is moving, the screens display a map and driving instructions or entertainment options like song titles or lists of radio stations. When the car is stopped, however, the screens can display TV or videos.
An experimental ''shutter LCD'' screen, made by Alpine Electronics for the Jaguar R-D6 concept car, shows video to the front passenger while letting the driver see only navigation data.
