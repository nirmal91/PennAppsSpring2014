To the Editor:
Re ''The Health of Nations,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 17):
All insurance is based on the distribution of risk, with many premium payers supporting fewer claimants. By design, insurance works when it is used only for unexpected, unforeseen or catastrophic events. But our public and our private health insurance systems ignore these basic principles.
The majority of Americans could afford to pay providers for routine health care. Doing so would make us better consumers and eliminate the administrative costs of a third party. The poor should be subsidized but should still pay providers directly.
We don't expect our car or home insurer to be the arbiter of oil changes or gutter cleanings, but we expect our health insurers to pay for flu shots and routine pediatrician visits.
