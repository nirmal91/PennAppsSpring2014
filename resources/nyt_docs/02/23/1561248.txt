A report by The Associated Press in the Sports Briefing column on Feb. 2 about a freestyle wrestling tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia, misstated the significance of the outcome. Joe Williams and Chris Bono won Olympic berths for the United States team in the weight classes in which they wrestled -- not for themselves. The United States competitors will be determined at the Olympic Trials from May 21 to 23 in Indianapolis.
