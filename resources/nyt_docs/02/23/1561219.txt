To the Editor:
In ''The Health of Nations'' (column, Feb. 17), Paul Krugman says ''people are happy with the quality of health care, if they can afford it.'' Unfortunately, what makes them happy is killing them.
Americans think access to high-tech procedures and expensive specialists translates into better outcomes, but the opposite is true.
Our European counterparts spend less per capita on health care, but live longer and have lower infant mortality rates. One reason is that their systems are oriented toward primary care.
Covering the uninsured without changing the system will waste money, while savings would accrue if we switched to the primary care model.
Unfortunately, neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are willing to address the elephant in the room.
