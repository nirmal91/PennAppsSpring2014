An American Airlines flight bound for Tokyo at 12:30 p.m. yesterday had to return to Kennedy International Airport shortly after takeoff because of engine trouble, the authorities said. No one was reported injured, and after landing, the plane was able to taxi to the gate. The plane, a Boeing 777, had a 10-member crew and 153 passengers, said Carlo Bertolini, a spokesman for American Airlines. He said the engine trouble was ''just a mechanical issue'' and cutting short the flight was ''precautionary.'' Holly Baker, a spokeswoman for the Eastern Region of the Federal Aviation Administration, said the F.A.A. would investigate the cause of the problem.
