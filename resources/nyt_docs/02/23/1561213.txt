To the Editor:
Jake Tapper (''The Medals Don't Matter,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 16) is no doubt right that John Kerry's medals alone won't win him the presidency, but that is not the point. The appeal of Mr. Kerry's war record is that it will protect him from Republican attacks on his patriotism and toughness.
Voters consistently side with Democrats on almost all domestic issues, the issues that voters care most about. The G.O.P.'s response has been to resort to fear-mongering by impugning Democrats on patriotism and national security issues.
With his medals as armor against those attacks, Mr. Kerry can focus the debate on the economy, health care and the environment, where President Bush's record is particularly vulnerable.
