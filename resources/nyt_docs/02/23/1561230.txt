The notebook PC is becoming the computing equivalent of a second car in many households. Notebooks finished off last year with strong sales, continuing to grab a growing share of the consumer PC market, NPD Techworld reported last week.
Mobile machines accounted for more than 35 percent of all PC's sold in retail stores last year, up from 29 percent in 2002 and 23 percent in 2001, the research firm said. Measured in dollar terms, consumer desktop and notebook sales are even.
The usual technology trends -- faster, cheaper and better -- have made notebooks more attractive and affordable. Consumer notebooks carried an average price tag of $1,329 in the fourth quarter of last year, down from $1,672 three years earlier.
But most notebooks are not getting lighter. They typically come with DVD players and CD burners. They are more movable than mobile. And they increasingly tap into the Internet via wireless home networks, the other hot growth market in home computing hardware.
So are the days of the desktop in the home numbered? ''I can't imagine that the death of the desktop is in sight, not for consumers,'' said Stephen Baker, an analyst for NPD Techworld. ''Mostly, notebooks are the second or third computer in the home.''
