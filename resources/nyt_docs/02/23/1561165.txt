To the Editor:
The ''debate'' on gay marriage (''Gay Marriage in the States,'' editorial, Feb. 18) is not a debate at all, because opponents have no case other than religious denunciation.
From a legal perspective, a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman would mean that certain people are denied family health benefits and equal access to tax-filing status as married couples because their sexual orientation offends someone's religion.
From a human perspective, it would mean that marriage, instead of signifying a commitment between two people to share their lives, would be a state license for heterosexual intercourse.
Saying that marriage must be ''defended'' by excluding gays is like saying that voting rights must be defended by excluding blacks.
