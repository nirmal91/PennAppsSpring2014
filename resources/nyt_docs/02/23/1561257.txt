An off-duty New York City police officer was arrested yesterday on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon after an early-morning altercation in the Park Slope section, the authorities said. The officer, Nelson Lucero, who is assigned to the 84th Precinct in downtown Brooklyn, was suspended after his arrest at 11:45 a.m. Officer Louis Camacho, a Police Department spokesman, said Officer Lucero used his police revolver to strike another man in the back of the head during a dispute at about 3 a.m. at Windsor Place and Eighth Avenue. The other man, described by Officer Camacho as a friend of Officer Lucero's, was treated at Lutheran Medical Center and released.
