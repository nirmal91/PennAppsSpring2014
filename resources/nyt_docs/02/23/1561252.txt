The Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago, seeking to stimulate growth after disappointing results, is categorizing the level of advertising and marketing support that its brands should receive.
At a presentation to analysts last week, Lee A. Chaden, executive vice president for global marketing and sales, divided the company's hundreds of brands into four categories. The top category is brands targeted for ''strategic investment,'' Mr. Chaden said, with current or potential sales of at least $500 million that can grow at least 10 percent a year. Those brands include the Ball Park, Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean lines of meats; Just My Size apparel; Sara Lee baked goods and cold cuts; and Senseo, a new single-serve in-home coffee system.
The second category identified by Mr. Chaden consists of brands to ''support and grow,'' with current or potential sales of at least $100 million that can increase at least 3 percent a year. Those brands include Earth Grains baked goods and Hanes and Playtex apparel.
The third category is for brands that Sara Lee will ''sustain,'' Mr. Chaden said, with flat to modest growth rates in regional markets. They include Kiwi shoe polish. The bottom category is for brands that Sara Lee will ''manage for cash,'' Mr. Chaden said. These brands, which will receive little or no marketing spending, include Endust spray polish and L'eggs and Hanes hosiery.
Sara Lee spends about $1 billion a year on all marketing communications, Mr. Chaden said, and half that is devoted to traditional advertising like television commercials and print advertisements.
