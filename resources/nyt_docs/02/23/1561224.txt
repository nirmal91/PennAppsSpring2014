To the Editor:
Paul Krugman says most American are happy with the quality of their health care (column, Feb. 17). But there is a disaster looming: the closing of major public hospitals due to state budget crises and the swelling ranks of the uninsured.
In California, where managed care made its earliest mark, such a collapse is imminent in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland.
Very quickly, beleaguered working-  and middle-class people will find their community emergency rooms swamped, hospital beds full and doctors unavailable as cost-cutting strategies yield their inevitable results: chaotic, error-filled, life-threatening ''care'' for all.
