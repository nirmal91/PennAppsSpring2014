HSBC Holdings, the financial services company, has narrowed a review for a worldwide advertising, marketing and communications account by eliminating a team of agencies owned by the Publicis Groupe in Paris. Total spending was estimated at more than $600 million.
Caroline Mooney, a spokeswoman at HSBC in London, confirmed a report of the decision that appeared on Adweek.com.
She identified the remaining finalists as agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, the Omnicom Group in New York and the WPP Group in London. HSBC said it hoped to complete the review in May; the goal is to consolidate all worldwide marketing services at units of a single agency company.
