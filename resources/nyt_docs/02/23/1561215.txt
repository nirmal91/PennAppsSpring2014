To the Editor:
Missing in the uproar over President Bush's service in the National Guard (news article, Feb. 18) is recognition that another mother's son, whose name may be engraved on the wall in Washington, probably had to serve in Mr. Bush's place.
Enlisting in the National Guard to be a weekend soldier is an honorable thing to do. Enlisting in the Guard to avoid the draft and using influence to bypass hundreds of other applicants, thereby forcing someone else to serve in Vietnam, may be legal but hardly honorable.
