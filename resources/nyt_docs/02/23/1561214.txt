To the Editor:
The question in this campaign is not whether voters prefer a candidate with a ''chest full of medals'' or not (Op-Ed, Feb. 16).
President Bush has made his integrity a central issue of his presidency. If he used his privilege and family connections to avoid fighting in a war that he claimed to support, broke his oath of service by not showing up for duty and is now less than forthcoming in his explanations, then his integrity comes under question.
John Kerry's service gives him the moral authority to raise these questions. That is why his chest full of medals matters.
