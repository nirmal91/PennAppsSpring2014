Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's main political opposition party, was attacked by a group of youths on Sunday but escaped unharmed, according to a leading member of the party, the Movement for Democratic Change.
Mr. Tsvangirai and his wife, Susan, were attacked when they stopped at a store on their way to Buhera, about 90 miles from Harare, the capital, the official said.
