To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 17) suggests that one way to keep costs down while providing health care to more Americans is to take insurance companies ''out of the loop.'' In the same issue, a letter writer suggests extending Medicare to more Americans.
One of the Democratic presidential candidates, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, proposes just that. His plan, called ''Enhanced Medicare for All,'' would provide comprehensive health care for all Americans, and this need not cost more than the country now spends.
Why are so few bold enough to suggest eliminating our insurance-based system?
