To the Editor:
In ''Promises, Promises'' (column, Feb. 16), Bob Herbert discusses unemployment and the international outsourcing of jobs, problems that he says ''go to the very heart of the American way of life.''
Outsourcing is not the fault of the Bush administration, but it is the consequence of the American way of life. We cannot do without luxury homes, cosmetics, prepared foods and designer clothing. Our luxuries require salaries that a prudent corporate America is unwilling to pay.
We want our incomes to be adequate to support our addiction to non-necessities, but we also want our commodities at commodity prices. We have not realized that one comes at the expense of the other.
When a foreign worker, living frugally, produces the same for less, that is basic economics, the manipulation of which is beyond the purview of a president.
