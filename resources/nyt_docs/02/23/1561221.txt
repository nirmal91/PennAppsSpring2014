To the Editor:
In ''The Health of Nations'' (column, Feb. 17), Paul Krugman says ''companies are becoming increasingly unwilling to offer insurance to their employees.'' I would go further: employers are increasingly unwilling to hire because of the high costs of health insurance.
My dentist now cleans teeth himself because it would cost him thousands of dollars a year just for health benefits if he hired a hygienist.
When will policy makers connect the dots between lagging job creation, a system that offers health insurance through employers and rapidly rising costs of health benefits?
