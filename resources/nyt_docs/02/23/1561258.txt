Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in his weekly radio address yesterday that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was rewarding suburban commuters with new rail cars at the expense of city bus riders. Last month, as a protest, mayoral appointees to the authority's board voted against a plan to spend more than $200 million on new cars for the Metro-North line. The city is continuing to lobby against the release of funds for the purchases. It was the second time in three weeks that the mayor, who wants the M.T.A. to take over bus service in boroughs outside Manhattan that costs the city $150 million a year, accused the M.T.A. of neglecting New Yorkers. ''The M.T.A. has resisted this idea by crying poverty,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority, said the M.T.A. could not absorb the full cost of running the bus lines. ''We agree that we could do a better and more efficient job,'' he said, ''however we could not take over the buses without the subsidy that the city currently provides.''
