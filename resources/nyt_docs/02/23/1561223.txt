To the Editor:
In ''The Health of Nations'' (column, Feb. 17), Paul Krugman referred to two groups of people -- those who possess health insurance and those who do not. I would suggest that there is yet a third group, of which I am a member.
I am a recently retired doctor, in excellent health and insured by Medicare but with a costly Medigap supplement. When I recently tried to make an appointment for my annual physical examination, I was informed by several receptionists that ''the doctor does not take Medicare patients.'' Only after I applied some professional influence was I able to get an appointment.
I wonder how many other Americans think that they are adequately covered yet can't find doctors who will accept their coverage.
