A small electrical fire in a Hofstra University dormitory complex in Uniondale, on Long Island, led to the evacuation of students for about two hours last night, but there were no injuries, the authorities in Nassau County said. Officer Bill Bendel, a spokesman for the Nassau County Police Department, said the fire was reported about 9:40 p.m. and brought under control within minutes. Gene Pietzak, an investigator for the Nassau County fire marshal, said the fire broke out in a elevator electrical panel on the first floor of the six-story Nassau/Suffolk Dormitory complex. Resulting damage was largely due to smoke and water used by firefighters to put out the fire.
