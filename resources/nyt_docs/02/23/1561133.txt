Re ''Captive Audience 30,000 Feet in the Air'' (On the Road column, Business Day, Feb. 17):
As I recently discovered on a flight from Florida to New York City, when flight crews try to ''entertain'' their passengers in flight, there can be unfortunate consequences.
As the plane was making its landing, one of the passengers started to remove his luggage. Immediately, the aisle started to fill with other passengers following suit. The steward asked them to be seated, but people ignored his orders. The crew's clowning antics during the flight had taken away the stewards' authority and respect, and the passengers treated them as if their words were of no consequence.
It was a bit tense as the plane was landing. Eventually, the passengers did sit down, the overhead bins were closed, and no one was hurt.
Being a steward on a plane is a very responsible job. If entertainment is needed on a flight, the airlines should hire a comedian and not use their stewards for this role.
