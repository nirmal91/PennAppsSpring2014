A valuable patch of common ground has unexpectedly surfaced in the first phase of the presidential election. In their early skirmishes over who's pandering most to special interests, both Democrats and Republicans have begun citing the same authority -- the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group dedicatedly nonpartisan in publicizing the power of money in politics. Imagine, in lieu of mud, the slinging of accurate information.
Denouncing the Democratic front-runner, Senator John Kerry, the Bush campaign cited the center's count that the Massachusetts Democrat has collected nearly $640,000 in donations from lobbyists in the past 15 years. In quick reply, the Kerry campaign also used the center to point out that in the last year alone the president raised that much and more -- $960,000 from lobbyists -- while reigning as ''the king of special interests,'' attracting $3.2 million from the gas and oil industry.
Fact-based skirmishing is refreshing. A Bush campaign adviser argues that the issue is not how much money the president accepts but how much of a hypocrite Senator Kerry might be. ''You don't hear the president in the Oval Office railing against the special interests,'' Mark McKinnon, the chief Bush media adviser, assured The Washington Post.
To paraphrase Oliver Twist: Please, sirs, we want some more. Voters need to see beyond melodramatic wedge issues to grasp the crass role special-interest money plays. There's plenty more realpolitik information out there. May the campaigns' barrages of enlightenment only continue.
