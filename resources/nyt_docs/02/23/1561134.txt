If you are shown a deal, it is often easy to judge what the declarer's first three plays will be in a given contract. Guessing what the last three cards in his hand will be is far more difficult, and the answer may be surprising.
Suppose South is playing a contract of two hearts with a low diamond lead. What do you guess he will hold after the 10th trick? Award yourself a prize if you get it right.
The occasion was a Grand National Team qualifying match in New York City in February, and the declarer was a man who seemed preordained at birth to be a cardplayer. His name is John Diamond, and he was a world junior team champion in 1991.
Any opening lead with good subsequent defense should have resulted in a two-trick defeat in two hearts. But the defense quickly went astray. West began with the diamond four, and East won with the ace and returned the nine. West took the king and played a third round in the hope that his partner would ruff. South was able to win with dummy's jack, discarding a spade from his hand.
The declarer tried a club from the dummy and scored his queen when East played low. Another club was taken by the ace, with West throwing a diamond. East cashed his spade ace and should have continued that suit, dooming the contract, since West's failure to discard a spade suggested that he held the king. But East led a club, the final and fatal defensive lapse. South discarded his remaining spade, and West ruffed.
Another diamond was led in the hope that East held the heart seven and would be able to uppercut effectively. But South held that card and used it to overruff East's six. South led to the heart jack, ruffed a spade, and had five tricks. The ending was this:
South claimed his contract. To win the last three tricks with the A K Q of trumps is extremely rare, perhaps unique, and is unknown in this department. Did you guess it?
