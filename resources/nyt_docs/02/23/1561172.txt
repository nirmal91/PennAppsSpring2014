Nearly 30 years after the end of the Vietnam War, a group of American veterans is organizing the first countrywide survey of all of the unexploded bombs, land mines and ordnance that still litter that Southeast Asian country.
The task is enormous, said Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, which will supervise the survey.
''When you consider that twice as many bombs were dropped on Vietnam than during the entire World War II you can begin to understand the magnitude of the effort required,'' he said. Mr. Muller plans to sign the agreement in Hanoi this week to begin the work.
Unlike Europe, which was surveyed after World War II and where ordnance clearance began soon after, Vietnam has lived with the deadly legacy of its wars for decades. The dangerous areas in Vietnam have yet to be fully identified, roped off or cleared. Hundreds of Vietnamese are injured or killed each year in explosions of bombs and land mines.
The veterans' group won permission from the Vietnam Defense Ministry to begin the job after several years of talks. The State Department endorsed their efforts and will underwrite much of the survey. The group has done land mine surveys in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.
Defense Department maps showing where bombs were dropped during the war will make it possible to complete the survey. The Vietnamese government will supply the workers who will do most of the painstaking survey work.
Mr. Muller said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was instrumental in getting the survey approved.
