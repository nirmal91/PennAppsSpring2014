A federal judge ordered a freeze on all of the personal assets of Carlos Sa√∫l Menem after determining that the former president failed to declare at least $500,000 uncovered in a Swiss bank account. Mr. Menem, who governed Argentina for a decade ending in 1999, is under investigation for suspected activities ranging from arms trafficking to accepting payoffs for thwarting an inquiry into a bombing in Buenos Aires that Iran is alleged to have organized, and Swiss authorities agreed recently to relax their bank secrecy laws and place his name on a list of foreign leaders suspected of corruption and money laundering.
