The European Union imposed a ban until March 23 on importing live poultry and eggs from the United States, citing an outbreak of avian influenza in Texas. Last year the union imported nine million eggs worth $25 million, a quarter of all eggs imported into the European bloc. Mexico also imposed a ban on poultry imports from the United States. Mexico bought nearly $100 million worth of American poultry in 2003.
