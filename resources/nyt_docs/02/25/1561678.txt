Citing a steep decline in loan loss provisions, the Bank of Montreal said its first-quarter income rose 34 percent and it raised its quarterly dividend to 40 Canadian cents a share from 35. Net income in the latest period was 532 million Canadian dollars ($398 million). The bank attributed the improved loan recoveries partly to the stronger American economy.
