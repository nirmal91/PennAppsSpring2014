To the Editor:
Bravo to David Brooks for speaking the repulsive truth about the modern American presidency (''You'll Never Walk Alone,'' column, Feb. 21). His assessment of this essentially inhuman phenomenon must elicit nods of weary agreement from thoughtful people on both sides of the political spectrum.
