JEAN-GEORGES VONGERICHTEN  and GRAY KUNZ  are the drawing cards at the SPICE MARKET , now open at 403 West 13th Street, which Mr. Vongerichten owns with PHIL SUAREZ . The two kitchen superstars have guided the new restaurant's menu, but left the day-to-day cooking to STANLEY WONG , the chef de cuisine, and PICHET ONG , left, the pastry chef. Mr. Ong, who also does desserts for Mr. Vongerichten's Chinese restaurant, 66, offers green-tea icebox cake, Ovaltine kulfi and sweet dim sum. The multilevel Spice Market is decorated with Indian temple carvings.
So much for retirement. Last year JOËL ROBUCHON  had enough of putting his feet up and opened L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, a small spot in Paris. Soon there was a Tokyo clone. And now he plans to open a restaurant in a yet-to-be-constructed part of the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas called the Mansion, which will consist of 30 villas. The restaurant is to be called JOËL ROBUCHON AT THE MANSION . Mr. Robuchon said he was ''seduced'' by the Las Vegas arrangement because ''you can do whatever you want, and they pay for everything.''
''The only objective is to satisfy the customer,'' he said, ''so it's not like owning one's own restaurant, and it becomes extremely tempting.'' He would like to have a restaurant in New York someday, he added, ''but Las Vegas is a good place to start.''
New York is losing DIANE FORLEY  and MICHAEL OTSUKA , who closed their restaurant, Verbena, last fall. They are moving to Ojai, Calif., where Mr. Otsuka will be the executive chef of the OJAI VALLEY INN AND SPA . Ms. Forley will consult for the spa.
LA TABLE O &amp; CO.  has opened at 92 Prince Street (Mercer Street), part of a Mediterranean market with the olive oils of OLIVIERS &amp; COMPANY , and the soaps and such of L'OCCITANE . La Table, an informal spot with ground-floor counter service and tables on a balcony, serves olive oil-infused soups, sandwiches and tarts.
FOOD STUFF  Correction:  March 3, 2004, Wednesday  A brief report in the Off the Menu column last Wednesday about a restaurant planned by the chef Joël Robuchon in Las Vegas referred incorrectly to the site, the Mansion at MGM Grand. Its 30 villas have indeed been completed; the restaurant, Joël Robuchon at the Mansion, has not.
