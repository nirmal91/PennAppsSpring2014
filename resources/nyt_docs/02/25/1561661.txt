To the Editor:
David Brooks (column, Feb. 21) describes what happens when politics is severed from belief and leadership. Yet if campaigning is so dismal, why are we trying to impose democracy on others?
A president is like any top salesman, forever pitching his product, whether ideas or slogans or wedge issues, to current or potential stakeholders. Effective political transactions exchange what people need (or want) with the resources at hand.
Why criticize tireless candidates who make their pitch in every nook and cranny? Mr. Brooks, what's the alternative to practiced speeches -- awarding victory to the big shot with the most money and the most TV sound bites?
