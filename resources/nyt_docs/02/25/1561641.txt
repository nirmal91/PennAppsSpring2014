Rod Paige, the education secretary, made a staggeringly stupid comment this week, comparing the nation's largest teachers' union to a ''terrorist organization'' because it opposes many elements of the two-year-old No Child Left Behind Act. This is the latest in a series of missteps by Mr. Paige.
President Bush came to Washington saying that education would be a centerpiece of his domestic agenda. Yet he chose as his education secretary someone who seems incapable of representing that policy or putting it in place. If the president wishes to succeed, he will need a far more composed and capable secretary of education. Mr. Paige has been repeatedly criticized by Congress for failing to administer the education act properly.
Mr. Paige made his ''terrorist'' remark at a gathering of governors at the White House, just before the president stepped up his re-election campaign. The statement, for which Mr. Paige later apologized, has given the union, the National Education Association, reams of free publicity and energized its effort to topple No Child Left Behind, which holds public schools accountable for closing the achievement gap between rich and poor children.
The list of Mr. Paige's errors is long. Last year he said he preferred to have a child in Christian schools and suggested that Christians were morally superior to others. He was called onto the carpet this week by members of the Senate who are threatening to revisit No Child Left Behind unless the department fully enforces the law as written. Instead of dealing with central issues, the department has wasted time and money on things like making sure the districts permit the right amount of ''constitutionally protected prayer.''
Mr. Paige's ''terrorist'' remark has finally exhausted his credibility and disqualified him as a spokesman for national education policy.
