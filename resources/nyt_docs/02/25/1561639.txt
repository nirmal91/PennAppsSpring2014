Traffic violations like making an illegal left turn could cost New Jersey drivers an extra $75 under provisions for surcharges on traffic offenses in Gov. James E. McGreevey's proposed budget. A serious offense like leaving the scene of an accident in which someone was injured could add $450 to an already stiff fine and court costs.
The state already imposes surcharges on regular fines and court costs for serious driving offenses.
But the McGreevey administration has found that many drivers -- 233,000 of them last year -- avoided them by getting their offense reduced to a charge of unsafe driving.
To capture that money, the governor proposes two new ways to get the help of bad drivers in balancing his budget.
First, he wants a $200 surcharge applied to convictions for unsafe driving, ending the plea-bargain shelter against the added state fee.
In addition, the governor wants the current extra charge of $100 on a sixth point for a violation raised to $150, with an additional $25 per point after that, to a maximum of 12 points.
The two points for an illegal left turn imposed on a driver with five points already on his or her license would work out like this: The $100 already charged for the sixth point would be increased to $150 under the budget proposal, plus $25 for the second point, for an increase of $75 over the current surcharge.
The highest point charge for a single offense is eight, for leaving the scene of an accident where an injury occurred.
The administration estimates that the $200 surcharge for an unsafe driving conviction will produce $45 million a year, and the added point charges, $5 million.
The total is to be combined with the 45-cent-per-pack increase in the state cigarette tax and used as the financing source to repay, over many years, the $1.5 billion the administration needs to borrow for the coming fiscal year.
