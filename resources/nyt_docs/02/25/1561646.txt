To the Editor:
Re ''Lawyers, Guns and Mayors,'' by Michael R. Bloomberg, Richard M. Daley, James K. Hahn and Scott L. King (Op-Ed, Feb. 24):
The four big-city mayors want to be able to sue gun makers. Since cars also kill people, why don't they sue car makers?
Gun ownership carries at least as many responsibilities as car ownership. People who want to own guns should pay for the privilege and prove to an insurer that they are capable.
Shift the burden to where it belongs; the makers may be venal, but they are not liable.
