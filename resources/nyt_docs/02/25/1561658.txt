To the Editor:
William Safire (column, Feb. 23), says the difference between the ''two Americas'' is a matter of optimism and pessimism, such as anger toward entitlements.
As a 17-year-old high school student who will soon face the rising costs of prestigious universities, I am angry that my generation is finding the job market cramped because of a shortage of quality positions, partly because many are being permanently sent overseas. And yes, I'm envious of the ''entitlements'' that underqualified students like George W. Bush received.
A little genuine understanding of the concerns of millions of Americans is far from the ''class war'' that Mr. Safire is too quick to allege.
