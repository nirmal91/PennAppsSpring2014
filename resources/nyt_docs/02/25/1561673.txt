Europe's largest tire maker, Michelin, posted a 45 percent decline in its 2003 net income, citing a rise in the price of rubber, a one-time acquisition charge and the strength of the euro against the dollar. Michelin said its net income fell to 317.5 million euros ($399 million) in 2003, from 580.8 million euros in 2002. Revenue fell 1.8 percent, but the company said that volume was up 3.7 percent. The company said results were affected by a charge of 306 million euros related to its acquisition of Viborg and 192 million euros in restructuring costs. Michelin did not issue specific target numbers for 2004, but the chief executive, Edouard Michelin, above, said he expected the global market to grow by only 1 to 2 percent and costs to remain high.
