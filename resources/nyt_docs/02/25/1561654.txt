To the Editor:
Re ''The Athlete on the Sidelines,'' by Jennifer Allen (Op-Ed, Feb. 20):
Last October, my husband and I attended a University of Maryland football game. Periodically, Maryland would score a touchdown and then the Maryland cheerleaders would come running from the sidelines and perform the most amazing gymnastics: multiple back flips, cartwheels and pyramids.
No offense to the Maryland football team, but the athletic performance of these cheerleaders was breathtaking.
I recall thinking: ''Why aren't these cheerleaders recognized for their athletic performance? Why aren't we celebrating their skills and ability the way we celebrate the football players'?''
What a wonderful thing to learn that the University of Maryland has recognized competitive cheerleading as a varsity sport.
