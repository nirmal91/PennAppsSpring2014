New York State Athletic Commission officials have informed the boxing promoter Bob Arum that the opponent selected for Floyd Mayweather Jr., the undefeated former junior lightweight and lightweight champion, is unacceptable because he is accused of shooting his fianc√©e.
Mayweather was to face Paul Spadafora of Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden on May 8. But Spadafora was freed on $50,000 bail after being charged with attempted criminal homicide, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and a firearms violation after the shooting on Oct. 26 in Pittsburgh.
Spadafora is promoted by Mike Acri and represented by Milt Chwasky, a New York lawyer. Neither returned phone calls seeking comment.
Ron Scott Stevens, the head of the New York commission, said it was ''a commission decision'' and declined further comment.
Mayweather has a great desire to fight at the Garden, and the World Boxing Council has ruled that a Mayweather-Spadafora bout would produce a mandatory challenger for its junior welterweight champion, Arturo Gatti.
