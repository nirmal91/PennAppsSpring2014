The state attorney general, Peg Lautenschlager, 48, was charged with driving under the influence after her car went into a ditch on Monday night as she was headed home to Fond du Lac. Ms. Lautenschlager, who said she fell asleep and drove off the road, said in a statement on Tuesday, ''I have disappointed many people who have put their faith in me.'' A breath test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.12 percent, above the state's limit of 0.08 percent, said her lawyer, Stephen J. Meyer.
