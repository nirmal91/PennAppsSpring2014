A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about jury selection in the trial of John J. Rigas, former chief executive of Adelphia Communications, and two of his sons, Michael and Timothy, misidentified a man shown with Michael Rigas outside the court. He was Adam J. Wasserman, a lawyer for Michael Rigas -- not Michael Mulcahey, former director of internal reporting, who is also on trial.
