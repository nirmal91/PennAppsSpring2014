To the Editor:
In an ideal world, the police would catch lawbreakers, bring them to justice and make cities safer places to live. But in ''Lawyers, Guns and Mayors'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 24), reality is seen.
More often, lawyers and the threat of monetary damage are the heart of law enforcement. It is ironic that passing the law immunizing gun makers against civil liability would be tantamount to taking the guns out of the hands of the police officers who keep our streets safe.
