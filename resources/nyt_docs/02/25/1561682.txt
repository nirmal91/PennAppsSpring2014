In his annual address to the city today, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, plans to call for improving school safety and giving money to teachers for classroom supplies, signaling that he intends to challenge the Bloomberg administration on education, its signature issue.
Mr. Miller, a Democrat likely to oppose Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2005, will criticize several of the mayor's education proposals and take aim at Gov. George E. Pataki over what he sees as a shortage in school financing, according to a copy of the speech obtained yesterday by The New York Times.
The speech has the speaker assailing the mayor for proposing to cut a popular program that gives $200 to each teacher for classroom supplies. ''Year after year, the mayor has cut this common-sense way to recognize the sacrifices that teachers make,'' Mr. Miller says in the speech, pledging to retain the program.
Mr. Miller will also suggest that the mayor's actions on school safety have not gone far enough. He will support legislation requiring the police and education officials to share school violence data and disclose it to the public, and to assess the number of school safety officers needed.
''I applaud the mayor's recent initiative to impose discipline and order at some of the city's most dangerous schools, but we need to make every school safe,'' the speech says. ''And we must provide parents, school authorities and the police with the tools to address violence and, better still, prevent it.''
Mr. Miller will say the Council plans to propose using money in the capital budget to install intercoms, metal detectors and other safety equipment in every public school. He does not give an amount, but Council officials said it would cost millions.
Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, rejected Mr. Miller's criticisms as a calculated effort to win the support of the teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers.
