Lawsuit Against the A.C.C. Is Dismissed
A Connecticut judge has dismissed all claims against the Atlantic Coast Conference and its officers in a lawsuit filed by four Big East schools over the A.C.C.'s expansion.
The decision was made public yesterday, a day after Judge Samuel Sferrazza dismissed the lawsuit against the A.C.C. commissioner, John Swofford, and three league officers. Sferrazza determined that neither the conference nor the officers had sufficient ties in Connecticut to be sued in the state.
Under the ruling, the Big East members' lawsuit against Boston College, its athletic director and Miami can move forward.
Boston College, Miami and Virginia Tech have accepted invitations to join the A.C.C. Miami and Virginia Tech join this year; Boston College comes aboard next year.
The plaintiff colleges -- Connecticut, Rutgers, Pittsburgh and West Virginia -- allege that the A.C.C. conspired with Miami and Boston College to weaken the Big East by luring away some of its biggest football powers. (AP)
