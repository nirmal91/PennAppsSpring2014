The Department of Energy said it was investigating reports of fraud and misconduct by a contractor that provides health care to workers at the Hanford nuclear complex. The contractor, the Hanford Environmental Health Foundation, had been accused by workers and watchdog groups of failing to diagnose correctly the occupational illnesses of workers now involved in the cleanup of Hanford, the nation's most contaminated nuclear site. Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, asked the department's investigator general this week to investigate the medical contractor, which had provided medical services at Hanford for 38 years but lost the contract this year.
