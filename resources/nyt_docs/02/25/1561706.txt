As shortages of influenza vaccine led to nationwide worries and long lines at health clinics at the height of the flu season, 80 percent of a new nasal spray vaccine went unsold and will probably have to be destroyed, the manufacturer told a federal panel on Tuesday.
The vaccine, FluMist, is made from live but weakened influenza viruses and was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration last June for healthy people ages 5 to 49. But Dr. Peter A. Patriarca, an official of the manufacturer, MedImmune Inc. of Gaithersburg, Md., said only one million of five million doses had been sold.
''Our initial launch was very disappointing,'' Dr. Patriarca told the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The Department of Health and Human Services appoints the 15-member panel to advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here on recommendations for influenza and a number of other immunizations.
Pharmaceutical companies made 87 million doses of influenza vaccine for use in the United States this season, 8 million fewer than for the 2002-03 season, when the manufacturers said they had to destroy 12 million doses for lack of demand.
The current influenza season began in October, an unusually early start, and led to a surge in demand for vaccine. By December, manufacturers of the standard vaccines, which are made by killing the influenza virus after it is grown in chicken eggs, said they had sold all their supply to distributors.
MedImmune's hopes that its competitors' exhausted supplies would raise sales of FluMist were dashed, Dr. Patriarca said, even though the company engaged in a comprehensive promotional program about the dangers of influenza and advertised FluMist directly to consumers.
When there was concern over the national shortage of standard vaccine, Dr. Patriarca said MedImmune offered 250,000 doses of FluMist free to states through the disease control agency. But state health departments asked for only 40,000 doses, a spokesman for the agency said.
Dr. Patriarca attributed lack of consumer demand for FluMist to a number of factors.
One was the misperception that the vaccine causes influenza. Although recipients of FluMist can give off the weakened live virus, the immunization did not cause illness in other people, Dr. Patriarca said, adding that the F.D.A. agreed in licensing the product as safe.
FluMist costs more than the standard vaccines, which are often given free by health departments and community groups.
Doctors charged their patients up to $150 for FluMist, Dr. Patriarca said. So MedImmune started a rebate program. But he said it did not help sales.
Dr. Patriarca pleaded with the panel to clarify the language of existing recommendations to make FluMist an acceptable alternative to protect health workers who care for patients whose immune system has been weakened by cancer, AIDS and other diseases.
Current recommendations caution people receiving FluMist, particularly health workers, to limit contact with such patients. But Dr. Patriarca contended that the recommendations had been overinterpreted to mean that FluMist should not be used by health workers.
The company is proposing studies to determine the consequences of transmission of the FluMist weakened virus to those with suppressed immune systems.
MedImmune plans to ask the F.D.A. to expand approval for FluMist to include children younger than 5 and adults ages 50 to 64. Also, Dr. Patriarca said that MedImmune was conducting trials at colleges and schools to determine FluMist's safety and effectiveness among students.
In another report, Dr. Jennifer Gordon Wright, a C.D.C. epidemiologist, told the panel that at least 135 children under age 15 had died from influenza in 38 states during the current season. Most had underlying medical problems.
Also, Dr. Gordon Wright said, health workers have linked influenza to 39 cases of brain damage, or encephalopathy, from 23 states and are reviewing reports of 45 additional such cases.
Most affected children were not in groups for whom routine influenza vaccination was recommended.
Of the 39 encephalopathy cases, 38 percent have recovered without permanent brain damage; 28 percent live with brain damage; and 18 percent died. The outcome is not known for the remaining 15 percent.
Deaths from influenza are uncommon among children ages 5 to 17. But health officials said they did not know if the 135 figure was unusually high because doctors and hospitals in the United States were not required to report pediatric influenza.
