An article on Feb. 11 about a student organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that examines the science of chocolate misstated the properties of three chemical compounds in a major component, cocoa butter. Palmitic acid is a 16-carbon chain, not a 14-carbon chain; stearic acid is an 18-carbon chain, not a 16-carbon chain; and oleic acid is an 18-carbon chain with a double bond, not just an 18-carbon chain.
