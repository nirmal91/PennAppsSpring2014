Because of an editing error, an obituary on Feb. 12 about Philip A. Straus, a financier and patron of art and education, misstated the date of his gift to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard for its art restoration center, later named the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. It was in the 1980's; 1928 was the center's founding year.
