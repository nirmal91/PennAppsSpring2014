A redistricting map developed by the state House of Representatives in 2001 denies Boston-area minorities the right to an equal vote and must be withdrawn in 60 days, a federal appeals panel ruled. The panel, composed of three district court judges, said the new map, among other things, intentionally packed black voters into one Boston district to benefit incumbents. The ruling sharply rebuked the panel that created the map and the speaker of the House, Thomas M. Finneran, whose district was one of those redrawn, saying the House leadership ''knew what it was doing.'' The court can draw its own map if an alternative is not completed in 60 days.
