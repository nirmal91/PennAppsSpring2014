A woman died last night in the University Heights neighborhood, apparently in an attempt to extinguish flames on her body that were ignited in a religious or healing ritual, the police said. Two police officers in the area heard a woman wailing and crying about 7 p.m. and followed the sound to a second-floor apartment at 51 North Street. The woman had burns on her torso and a wound on her forehead, the police said. She apparently hit her head while trying to put out the flames and died from the injury. Another woman in the apartment had burns on her hand and was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition, the police said. The dead woman, who was 41, appeared to have been taking part in a ritual using tarot cards and candles, law enforcement officials said.
