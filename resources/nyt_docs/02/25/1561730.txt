Center Eric Lindros was cleared yesterday to begin his concussion rehabilitation program immediately. Lindros, who sustained the eighth concussion of his N.H.L. career on Jan. 28, was re-examined in Montreal by a specialist, Dr. Karen Johnston.
In a statement released by the Rangers, Johnston said, ''Eric is progressing very well and we are encouraged with his recovery to date.''
There is no timetable for Lindros to return to the lineup. But he was cleared to begin light cardiovascular activity, with controlled workload and heart rate, the statement said.
Should Lindros resume playing before the trading deadline, the Rangers might consider dealing him.
The Rangers, according to an N.H.L. team official, have been asked by a Western Conference team -- believed to be Detroit -- whether Mark Messier would be available in a trade.
Lindros, who turns 31 on Saturday, is in the final guaranteed season of the contract he signed with the Rangers when he was acquired from Philadelphia in August 2001. Lindros has a base salary of $3.3 million and receives an additional $80,000 a game (up to 75 games). The Rangers have an option on Lindros's contract for next season at $10.25 million, which they are unlikely to exercise.
With Lindros's medical history, the Rangers would most likely not get much in return. But because any potential suitor would have to pick up only the remainder of Lindros's contract for this season, there might be a market for him.
