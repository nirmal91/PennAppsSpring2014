Mordechai Vanunu, who worked at the country's main nuclear reactor and was sentenced to 18 years in prison for divulging details of the plant to a British newspaper in 1986, will be placed under government supervision when he completes his sentence in April, the prime minister's office said. A statement by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office did not specify the restrictions but said the intention would be to prevent Mr. Vanunu ''from committing additional security crimes.'' Israel has always refused to discuss its nuclear program.
