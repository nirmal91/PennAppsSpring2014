Re ''Armory Helps Indoor Track Come Full Circle,'' by David Gonzalez (Citywide column, Feb. 24):
I spent my Saturdays in the 1980's running on the wooden floors of the 168th Street Armory for school pride and a medal. It was a dark and humid place, one where runners' steps produced a fine dust that choked coaches and fans.
The smell and the grime of the armory were incredible. But I loved the place. I couldn't wait for race days. It was on those days when a kid like me, one lucky to attend a prep school in Queens, could learn not to fear the homeless.
The armory was a gem for racing and learning back then. I'm glad that it continues to make a positive difference in the lives of kids.
