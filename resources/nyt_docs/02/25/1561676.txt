Swiss International Airlines said in a preliminary report that it cut its loss last year to 687 million Swiss francs ($547 million) from 980 million francs a year earlier. The airline said it reduced expenses by cutting staff, fleet size and the number of routes it flies. Revenue declined to 4.1 billion Swiss francs from 4.4 billion.
