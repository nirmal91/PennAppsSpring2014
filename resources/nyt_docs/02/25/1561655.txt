To the Editor:
Jennifer Allen (Op-Ed, Feb. 20) wants cheerleading to become an N.C.A.A. sport. Cheerleaders do exhibit impressive talents in ''a routine of back flips, handsprings, round-offs and splits,'' but athletes can hone and display these skills in the sport of gymnastics.
As for the other element of cheerleading that Ms. Allen touts (''an athlete tossed 30 feet in the air -- smiling''): why should colleges invest athletic money to promote the activity of young men tossing around young women, especially when ''cheerleading is the No. 1 cause of serious sports injuries to women''?
