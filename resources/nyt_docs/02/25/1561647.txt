To the Editor:
Nowhere in the Feb. 24 Op-Ed article by the mayors of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Gary, Ind., is there mention of the National Rifle Association. That group's lobbying efforts in Congress and its financial clout have cowed many lawmakers into relinquishing their responsibilities concerning handgun legislation.
The four mayors should be ashamed for not placing the blame where it belongs.
