To the Editor:
It's striking that William Safire (''My Anti-Stump Speech,'' column, Feb. 23) simplistically characterized ''the two Americas'' as ''optimistic America'' and ''pessimistic America.'' As a respected word and language maven, he overlooked what most voters truly pine for: ''realistic America.''
Voters want politicians to tell us what can be done, not what should be done according to their political orthodoxy. America is a great and wonderful land of incredible richness. It's a country that can show both respect and empathy to all, and offer everyone, no matter their background or station, a chance to succeed. Republicans like to label this kind of sentiment ''class warfare,'' but many voters prefer the term ''social conscience.''
It appears that much like ''If you're not with us, you're against us,'' the new philosophy is ''If you're not an optimist, you're a pessimist.'' If I have to be labeled, I prefer to be called a happy realist. Perhaps Mr. Safire would consider that an oxymoron.
