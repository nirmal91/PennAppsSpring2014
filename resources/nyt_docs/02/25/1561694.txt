A worker who maintained ticket vending machines for the Long Island Rail Road was charged yesterday with stealing more than $35,000 worth of MetroCards from them, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.
The authority's police arrested the worker, James Barzola, 27, of the Bronx at Pennsylvania Station yesterday after they caught him stealing cards, said the spokesman, John J. McCarthy. Mr. Barzola worked for CAPtech Inc., a subcontractor.
The police began an investigation several months ago after a railroad supervisor noticed that several hundred cards were missing from the machines at Penn Station, Mr. McCarthy said. They eventually connected the missing cards to Mr. Barzola, by studying who was maintaining the machines, he said. Mr. Barzola was charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property.
