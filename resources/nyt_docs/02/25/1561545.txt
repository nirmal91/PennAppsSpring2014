La Semeuse coffee, roasted and blended in Switzerland and sold in vacuum packages, has introduced its first organic coffee, Soleil Levant. The coffee is grown in Colombia, Peru and Indonesia according to Fair Trade standards, which guarantee better prices for farmers and work to improve health care and education in their areas.
Soleil Levant (the name means sunrise) has the same full-bodied richness as La Semeuse's regular coffee. It is available from www.CafeLaSemeuse.com either whole bean or ground in 8.8-ounce packages for $9 plus shipping.
