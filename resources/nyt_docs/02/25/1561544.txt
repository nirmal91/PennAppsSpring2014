Neil Kleinberg, left, who owns Clinton St. Baking Company and Restaurant, 4 Clinton Street (Houston Street), likes uncluttered cakes. His new line for birthdays or other special occasions consists of home-style cakes with fairly dense layers of dark chocolate or golden vanilla cake neatly covered with plain chocolate or vanilla butter cream and decorated with just a little writing. Because the cakes are all about yummy cake and icing, only crumbs will be left after the party. In the spring Mr. Kleinberg said he will make strawberry and whipped cream cakes and maybe coconut. An eight-inch cake is $25, a 10-inch is $40 and a 12-incher is $50, to be ordered 48 hours in advance from (646) 602-6263.
