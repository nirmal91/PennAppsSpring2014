Seton Hall enhanced its chances of making the N.C.A.A. tournament, using a strong inside game to repel Miami on Tuesday night.
The Hurricanes had no answer for the inside work of the sophomore center Kelly Whitney as the Pirates won, 76-66, before 2,401 at the university's Convocation Center.
Whitney's 20 points complemented guard Andre Barrett's 23 for the Pirates (18-7, 8-5), who have three games left to play in the Big East.
The Pirates shot 54.9 percent from the field, helped by Whitney's mostly unimpeded inside work.
''We saw he was getting open, so we just kept feeding him the ball,'' guard John Allen said.
Whitney felt sheepish in describing how easy he made his scoring look. ''After a while,'' he said, ''they started double-teaming me.''
Seton Hall Coach Louis Orr came in viewing Miami (13-15, 3-11) as a dangerous opponent because so many of the Hurricanes' losses have been decided late in games.
Less than five minutes into the game, Barrett hit the first of five 3-pointers. Seton Hall has made at least one 3-pointer in 386 straight games, a streak that began Dec. 7, 1991.
