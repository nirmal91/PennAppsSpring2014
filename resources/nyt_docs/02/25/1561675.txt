German business confidence fell in February as a result of the euro's record strength against the dollar, a monthly survey by the Ifo Institute said. After 10 months of growing optimism, the overall index, based on a survey of 7,000 businesses about the current business climate, fell to 96.4 from 97.5 in January.
