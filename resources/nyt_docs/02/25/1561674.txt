The British cash-handler Securicor and the Danish security company Group 4 Falck said that they would merge to create Group 4 Securicor, a London-based security company that will be 57.5 percent owned by Falck shareholders. Falck will spin off its rescue and global-solutions units to create a separate company that will be listed in Copenhagen. Security companies are under pressure to consolidate after United Technologies purchased Chubb, the No.3 security business, in June 2003.
