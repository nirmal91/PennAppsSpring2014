Are you rooting for ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' to win the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday night? Then you might turn to the chapter on knights and kings in ''Movie Menus, Recipes for Perfect Meals With Your Favorite Films'' by Francine Segan (Villard, $16.95) and check out the roast garlic-saffron toasts, which are based on a 14th-century dish. The recipes, designed for easy entertaining on Oscar night, are grouped according to movie categories like westerns, romance and gangsters. Buttermilk biscuits could accompany Jude Law's scenes from ''Cold Mountain'' and, from the chapter on romantic dinners, to salute Diane Keaton in ''Something's Gotta Give,'' beef tenderloin with pink peppercorn sauce. There are more bits of movie trivia and quotations in the pages than there are peas in a potpie.
