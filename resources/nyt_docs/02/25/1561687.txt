The United States suspended the import of all French meat and poultry, saying France had failed an audit of inspection facilities. A spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said that the ban, which includes fois gras and pâté, was effective immediately. Three of the 11 French meat or poultry establishments audited by the United States in the last two months failed. The top French meat exports are cold cuts, including hams and sausages.
