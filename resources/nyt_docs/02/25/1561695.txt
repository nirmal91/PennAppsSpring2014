With time running out before the state budget is due, Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of Gov. George E. Pataki's education commission, has asked for an extra two weeks to calculate how much it will cost to provide every schoolchild in New York City with a sound basic education.
The request, which the governor's office said yesterday would probably be granted, could complicate the Legislature's pledge to deliver a budget on time this spring, after 19 consecutive years of missing the New York's April 1 deadline.
In a letter to the governor yesterday, Mr. Zarb explained that the extra time was needed to ''deliver a quality report.'' Its purpose is to pin down a dollar figure for satisfying an appeals court order to put more money into New York City's public schools.
The commission's ability to finish the task by March 1, its original deadline, was hampered last month when Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, rejected the commission's $1.2 million contract with Standard &amp; Poor's because of a potential conflict of interest. Standard &amp; Poor's said it would continue working with the commission to come up with a figure, whether it was paid or not.
But the delay prompted concern among the plaintiffs in the case, a group called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, because it could leave legislators little time to debate the amount of money necessary to satisfy the court order.
The governor has proposed using the profits from video lottery terminals, which he said would generate about $325 million this year, for the schools. Some legislators have called the approach both risky and inadequate, given that previous analyses have found that at least an extra $6 billion a year would ultimately be needed to help students meet the state's graduation standards.
