Officials belatedly rolled out a plan to supply antiretroviral drugs to the nation's 5.3 million H.I.V.-positive citizens, saying that nutritional supplements and anti-H.I.V. drugs would be made available at least one center in every health district within a year and in all towns within five years. The drugs will be warehoused in each of the nation's nine provinces, officials told Parliament, but supply constraints could be a problem because crucial ingredients would be imported from China and India, which have their own mounting H.I.V. problems.
