Circuit City is placing in review the creative part of its general market advertising account, which has been handled for three years by the Chicago office of Foote Cone &amp; Belding, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer based in Richmond, Va., spends about $220 million a year on such advertising and has been seeking to stimulate sluggish sales. The company recently closed 19 stores.
Hasan Ramusevic, president at Hasan &amp; Company in Raleigh, N.C., the search consultant helping to manage the review, confirmed a report of the decision yesterday in Adweek.com. The review is part of efforts by Circuit City, he said, ''to make sure it has the best possible thinking in all areas of marketing.''
Foote Cone is one of about a dozen agencies being asked to take part in the review, Mr. Ramusevic said, adding that a decision is expected by the end of April. Julie Kreiter, a spokeswoman at Foote Cone, declined comment when asked whether the agency would participate.
