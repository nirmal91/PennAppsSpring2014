The New York Police Department will send two detectives to Costa Rica today to meet with Costa Rican authorities and United States officials there about the case of Maria Cruz, a 35-year-old investment banker who disappeared last April, Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the New York Police Department said. The police suspect that a sham New York doctor, Dean Faiello, may have been responsible for the death of Ms. Cruz. Mr. Faiello is believed by investigators to be in Costa Rica, and is suspected to have treated Ms. Cruz on the day she disappeared, the police have said.
