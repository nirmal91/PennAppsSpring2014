To the Editor:
Re ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' (column, Feb. 21):
What David Brooks describes as the mind-numbing, personality-stripping experience of presidential campaigning is, sadly, right on the money and all too obvious to anyone with a whit of independent critical thinking. The lack of such critical analysis by citizens is strangling American democracy.
We live in a country and a culture in which the majority of citizens refuse to invest enough time to learn and think about the complex problems that we face as a nation, and are therefore incapable of judging a candidate on any basis other than a vain ''idealized extension of themselves.''
We are no longer self-governors. We are civic spectators who want spectacle. And we get what we deserve.
