A consortium led by the Istanbul-based mobile phone operator Turkcell beat four competitors to win a contract to build Iran's second mobile phone network, officials announced. The consortium, which includes Ericsson of Sweden and Teliasonera of Finland, as well as an Iranian partner, agreed to pay $385 million and hand over a share of its revenue to the state-owned monopoly. It expects to introduce the network in 2005.
