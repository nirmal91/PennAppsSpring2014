To the Editor:
Re ''Lawyers, Guns and Mayors'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 24): Rather than continuing to pursue one of the most highly regulated industries in America, we should consider the enforcement of existing gun laws to incarcerate criminals.
In addition, allowing the carrying of concealed weapons by would-be victims may keep potential attackers off guard, thereby decreasing crime.
We appreciate the efforts of our mayors in their most difficult tasks, but attacking an overwhelmingly honest industry while leaving citizens unarmed and criminals free will not make any of us safer.
