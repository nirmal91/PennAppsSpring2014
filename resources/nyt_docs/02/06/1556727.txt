Richard Lewis, who has led the Absolut vodka account at TBWA Worldwide in New York, is giving up his responsibilities for the assignment after 17 years.
''It was a lot of fun, a tremendous ride,'' said Mr. Lewis, worldwide managing director for the global Absolut account at TBWA. ''In building the brand, we weren't afraid to take risks.''
Under Mr. Lewis, 50, TBWA produced more than 1,500 ads in an award-winning campaign centered on the unusual-looking Absolut bottle. The campaign helped make Absolut, sold by the Stockholm-based V&amp;S Group, the best-selling imported vodka in the United States.
''I have the obviously shaped tombstone already ordered for me,'' Mr. Lewis said, laughing. He will be a consultant to Tom Carroll, president for the Americas at TBWA, part of the Omnicom Group, he said, and plans to write a follow-up to his book, ''Absolut Book.''
Rob Rosenthal, 42, president at TBWA Latin America for seven years, will succeed Mr. Lewis on the account. Tania Kulb, 42, will succeed Mr. Rosenthal; she had been national marketing director for McDonald's in Brazil.
