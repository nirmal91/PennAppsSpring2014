To the Editor:
Considering the clear biblical admonitions against homosexual behavior, ''Gay Couples Seek Unions in God's Eyes'' (front page, Jan. 30) makes no sense.
The key reason for giving special consideration to marriage is its unique role in the procreation and education of children, which is impossible with ''gay unions,'' and the consequences of properly doing this for all of society.
Drug abuse, crime, poverty and educational difficulties are reduced when children are raised by a mother and a father.
Traditional marriage is in enough trouble today without further adding the absurdity and degradation of ''gay unions'' to its problems.
