The police are investigating the death of a Long Island man recently released from prison and found fatally shot in Queens. The man, Frank Dimarco, 52, stopped reporting to his parole officer in late January, prompting the State Division of Parole to issue a warrant for his arrest. Mr. Dimarco was found with a gunshot wound to the head, lying on the sidewalk on 132nd Road in Springfield Gardens, around 10:20 p.m. Wednesday, the police said. Neighbors said they had heard a shot and a speeding car. Mr. Dimarco had lived in Westbury since November, said a neighbor. Mr. Dimarco was released in August after serving 12 years of consecutive sentences for a burglary and several robbery convictions.
