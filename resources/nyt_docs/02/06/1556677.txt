To the Editor:
Re ''Massachusetts Gives New Push to Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 5):
President Bush, responding to the Massachusetts court decision that gays should be allowed to marry, said, ''Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.''
Government is not in the business of making things ''sacred.'' Those who believe that marriage is sacred will no doubt choose to be married in a religious ceremony.
Religions make their own choices about whom to marry.
A non-church wedding, generally referred to as a civil ceremony, is about establishing legal rights and responsibilities for a couple. It is the fairness of allocation of those legal rights that the Massachusetts court addressed.
