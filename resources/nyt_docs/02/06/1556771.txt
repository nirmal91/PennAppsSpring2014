Hailed in his time as ''the Michelangelo of the menagerie,'' and today as France's greatest animalier, or portrayer of animals, Antoine-Louis Barye (1796-1875) applied a robust realism to his portrayal of beasts and reptiles as well as humans. His small-scale bronzes depicting warriors on horseback, lions and tigers at their prey, frisky elephants and mythological encounters appealed -- like the work of his friend Eug√®ne Delacroix -- to a Romantic Age audience with an appetite for the passionate and fiercely intense.
A tiger tearing apart a crocodile as it thrashes futilely around his body; a rearing horse surprised by a lion that has jumped on its back; a howling bear attacked by a pack of wild dogs; Theseus pointing a sword at the throat of an attacking Minotaur: these are some of the dramatic tableaus that brought Barye fame. His work had a calmer side, too: keenly observed animals, from rabbits and turtles to dogs and horses, depicted in their habitual stances. His mastery of human and animal figures also enabled him to do powerful equestrian sculptures, like a dramatic figure of a Tatar warrior stopping his elegant horse (1845).
This show brings together more than 100 examples of Barye's work, including, for purposes of comparison, several castings of some models, drawn entirely from American collections. Assembling them is a coup for the gallery. But unless you have a compelling interest in the sculptor, you might find the profusion a little wearying. A more selective show would better highlight his achievements.
