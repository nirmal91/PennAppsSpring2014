WHO -- Rich Daffurn, 56, a dentist, and Cindy Daffurn, 52, a bookkeeper in Sonoma, Calif.  WHAT -- 5-bedroom house  WHERE -- Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, Calif.
Rich: We bought the house in March of 2001. It is white stucco with wood trim, reminiscent of the Pasadena bungalow type. It's about 80 years old.
Cindy: The reason that we knew it would be a good rental property is that we had been renting over here for many years, and it's difficult to find something this large. We had been renting houses that were not nearly as lovely as this house, so we knew by years of experience that we ourselves would love to rent it.
Rich: It's in the Flats, an area that appeals to people because it's easy to walk the three blocks to the beach and back.
Cindy: We get here probably three times a year, and we spend a great deal of our time with home maintenance while we're here because it's an old house. Our time on the island and in our home is limited by our desire to have it rented as much as possible.
Rich: We're trying to get a tradition at New Year's where we get friends and family to come over and celebrate with us. We've pretty much ruled out coming here in the summer unless someone has canceled. My wife has a hard time reconciling the fact that she loves this house, but that it is a business. If you walk in here it looks like a home. We have a lot of pictures and memorabilia up. It doesn't look like a thin little beach lodge.
Cindy: It takes a constant focus in my head to remind myself that this is not my nest. On our way to the house, I am always filled with anxiety until I go to every room and make sure everything is intact. And it always is.
