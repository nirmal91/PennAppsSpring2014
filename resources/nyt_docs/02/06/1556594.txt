To the Editor:
Re ''The Halliburton Shuffle,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 30):
Halliburton is not, despite what Mr. Herbert says, a company that goes to great lengths to escape taxes. We have the highest compliance standards, and above all a commitment to ethics.
Halliburton has significant business abroad, and pays taxes abroad, for which the United States gives us a tax credit. This is not a loophole; it is how our tax system works.
Unlike competitors who operate domestically but have moved their domiciles to tax-haven countries, Halliburton proudly remains an American company and has a higher effective tax rate as a result.
Mr. Herbert says we paid $15 million in United States income taxes for 2002. It is only fair to add that we paid this even though we reported to shareholders a large pretax loss on American operations for the period.
As to Iraq, I am extremely proud of our employees there who risk their lives every day to provide housing, meals and other vital services to our troops.
