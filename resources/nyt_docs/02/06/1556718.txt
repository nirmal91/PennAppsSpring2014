Secretary General Kofi Annan has invited Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to New York on Tuesday for emergency talks on ending the island's 30-year division. The deadline negotiations will be aimed at completing an agreement to submit to an island-wide referendum in April, in time for a reunited Cyprus to join the European Union on May 1.
