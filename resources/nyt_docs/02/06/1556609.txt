George Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2'' was originally called ''Ballet Imperial'' at its premiere in 1941. The present title, adopted by Balanchine in 1973, may be musicologically precise, but the old one hints at the work's stylistic grandeur.
During the New York City Ballet's winter season at the New York State Theater, ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2'' has not been grand enough. But on Saturday night it regained some of its splendor when its leading female role was performed by a guest ballerina, Caroline Cavallo, an American-born dancer from the Royal Danish Ballet, which also has this work in its repertory.
Heading a cast that once again featured Charles Askegard as the ballerina's partner and Ashley Bouder as the secondary female soloist, Ms. Cavallo moved with confidence, making her steps in motion clear and her poses firm. And the upward reach of her arms conveyed a sense of spaciousness.
Ms. Cavallo did much to emphasize the choreography's implicitly dramatic qualities. She brought a sense of regal authority to the work's first and third movements. But the way she approached and withdrew from Mr. Askegard in the second movement made her appear an elusive presence, as if she had stepped out of the vision scene of a 19th-century Romantic ballet.
The other dancers now seem more at home in the choreography than they did earlier this season. Maurice Kaplow conducted, and Susan Walters was the piano soloist.
Richard Moredock conducted the program's other two ballets, also by Balanchine. ''Donizetti Variations,'' led by Jenifer Ringer and Philip Neal, was danced with appropriate lightness, yet with little sense of spontaneity. In ''Scotch Symphony'' Kyra Nichols was once again an ethereal presence as she was pursued by Nilas Martins. Pascale van Kipnis was a charming Scottish lass.
