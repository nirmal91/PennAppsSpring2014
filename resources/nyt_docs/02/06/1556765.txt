Guild &amp; Greyshkul  22 Wooster Street, SoHo  Through Feb. 21
''Mute,'' an exhibition of five artists associated with Lisson Gallery in London, provides little visual excitement but offers some more or less droll approaches to words and sounds.
In a slide projection piece by Pierre Bismuth called ''Mute and Noisy,'' each of 81 slides shows a handprinted word synonymous with the preceding word. Placid, for example, follows serene. The meanings gradually change as the words progress, so that what started with the word mute ends 80 words later with the word noisy.
Nearby, sounds rhythmically alternate between two speakers on the floor in a piece by Ceal Floyer. To the left, you hear the sound of a shovel digging into dirt; to the right, the dirt hitting the ground a few feet away. The illusion is as much spatial as aural.
Fernando Ortega shows album covers in which he has slyly altered the vinyl discs inside in response to the cover. For an album by a well-known Mexican singer who is a dwarf, for example, he created a miniature, 45-r.p.m. version of the original record.
A wall text by the filmmaker Douglas Gordon says ''Read the Word'' on one side of a corner and ''Hear the Voice'' on the other. A photograph documents a performance scripted by Jonathan Monk in which a D.J. at the exhibition opening played music that was audible only through his own headphones.
