Health care providers and pharmacists could refuse to participate in procedures, including abortion, that contradict their moral or religious beliefs under a bill approved by the State Senate. A similar bill passed the Assembly last June. The Senate approved the measure, which includes exemptions from sterilizations and experiments on human embryos or fetal tissue, by a vote of 20 to 13.
