To the Editor:
Re ''Subway Headache: MetroCard Devices Often Need Repairs'' (front page, Feb. 3):
You quote a passenger at a station where all the MetroCard vending machines are out of service: ''It makes you go to work late when you have to wait on a big line.''
Where have individual planning and individual responsibility gone? Why don't people refill their MetroCards at their leisure rather than when they're on their way to work?
