The Toronto property company Brascan Group shocked London markets by saying that it will make a higher-than-expected bid of $2.9 billion for Canary Wharf, the commercial real estate complex that has become London's financial hub. Hours later, a group of investors led by Morgan Stanley countered with an offer that values the property at $2.93 billion. The board of Canary Wharf has already backed a previous bid from Morgan Stanley.
