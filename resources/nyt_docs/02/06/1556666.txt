Giants Coach Tom Coughlin completed his staff yesterday, naming the New England Patriots' quarterbacks coach, John Hufnagel, as his offensive coordinator.
Hufnagel, 52, worked on Bill Belichick's staff the past season with Tom Brady, the most valuable player of Sunday's Super Bowl. Before that, Hufnagel was Coughlin's quarterbacks coach in Jacksonville in 2002. He has also worked for the Indianapolis Colts and the Cleveland Browns, and had stints in the Canadian Football League and as head coach of the Arena Football League's New Jersey Red Dogs.
In addition to Brady, Hufnagel has tutored Peyton Manning, Doug Flutie, Jeff Garcia and Mark Brunell.
''John has worked with some outstanding players,'' Coughlin said in a statement. ''Before I hired John in Jacksonville, I talked to Peyton Manning about him, and he gave him a solid recommendation. He is an outstanding football coach. He has an old-fashioned work ethic. He goes to work and does his job. He is not a hype guy. He is meticulous and detailed.''
Hufnagel played three seasons as a quarterback in the N.F.L. after setting the single-season record for passing yards at Penn State in 1972. (It has since been broken.) He played for the Denver Broncos before finishing his pro career with three C.F.L. teams. He began coaching in 1987 as a player/coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Under N.F.L. rules, Coughlin had to wait until after the Super Bowl to hire Hufnagel.
The Giants have personnel questions looming at quarterback. The starter, Kerry Collins, is looking for a contract extension as he goes into the final year of his deal, terms of which will signal the team's commitment to him as its long-term quarterback. Coughlin and General Manager Ernie Accorsi also have to decide on the backups. Jesse Palmer did not have a good showing after Collins was hurt last season, and the third-stringer, Jason Garrett, is a 13-year veteran nearing the end of his career.
