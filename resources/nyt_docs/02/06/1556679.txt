To the Editor:
Re ''Massachusetts Gives New Push to Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 5):
My partner and I are happy to be part of a community of gay men and women who are part of long-term relationships.
We have been together for 43 years. Britney Spears was married for 55 hours and had more legal rights than we ever had.
It's about time that the courts recognized that gays can and do love, share and commit their lives to one another; in many cases, these relationships last longer than straight marriages.
