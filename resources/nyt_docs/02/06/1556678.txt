To the Editor:
Re ''Massachusetts Gives New Push to Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 5):
The citizens of Massachusetts and our elected lawmakers gave no support to gay marriage. The state's Supreme Court decided that it would make the law.
Judges who believe that they have a right to make law have no place in our judicial system and should be removed from the bench.
Many legislators and citizens who supported civil unions now find themselves backed into a corner on this issue, and unfairly so. The only ''push'' will be legislators and citizens pushing back with an amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
I applaud our state's legislators for taking immediate action for this amendment.
