To the Editor:
''Gaza First'' (editorial, Feb. 4) says that ''for a Palestinian state to be viable, it will have to be made up of the entire West Bank and Gaza, with small adjustments.''
This basic formula for a two-state solution, vital to achieving peace, has had widespread support for several years.
A survey by the Baker Institute at Rice University found that 53.3 percent of Israelis and 55.6 percent of Palestinians favored a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. As part of the People's Voice initiative, 160,150 Israelis and 100,000 Palestinians signed on to this blueprint for a Palestinian state.
A 2003 unofficial peace proposal, called the Geneva Accords, addressed this solution in detail and received support from 7 Nobel Peace Prize winners and 60 current and former world leaders.
This is the prescription for people who are serious about peace.
