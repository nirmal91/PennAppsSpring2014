Sheriff Dave Reichert of King County said he would seek the Congressional seat of Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Republican, who declared last month that she would retire after 12 years in the House. Sheriff Reichert, who is 53 and a Republican, is best known for his two-decade involvement with the investigation of the Green River killings. The case ended last year when Gary L. Ridgway pleaded guilty to killing 48 women.
