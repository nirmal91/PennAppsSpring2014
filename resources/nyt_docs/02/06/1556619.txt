To the Editor:
''U.S. Official Defends Use of Sex Studies'' (news article, Jan. 30) was welcome news to those of us working in sexuality research. If the unfounded attacks on our work had been left unanswered by the National Institutes of Health, it would have crippled research and hindered the use of scientific knowledge to save lives.
In my 25 years in the field, I have never seen such a climate of fear and intimidation in science. The United States government must advocate strongly on behalf of scientific research on sexuality.
Our work is not just about disease prevention or sex acts. What is at stake is the urgent need for reliable data, not ideology, that helps all of us understand sexuality across the course of life -- how love, pleasure and intimate relationships support and sustain healthy individuals and families.
