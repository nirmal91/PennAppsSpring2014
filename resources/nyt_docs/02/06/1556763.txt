The computer problems that crippled the Mars rover Spirit are now fully behind it, NASA mission managers said. A complete erasing and resetting of the memory the rover uses to store data cured a software glitch that on Jan. 21 cut the rover off from its controllers in Pasadena, Calif. On the other side of the planet, the rover Opportunity completed its examination of soil next to its landing site and rolled 10 feet to a new location.
