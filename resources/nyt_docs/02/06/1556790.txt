A suspect in a shooting spree that wounded nine people at a Brooklyn diner last month was found dead, apparently a suicide, in an Albany apartment Wednesday afternoon after being surrounded by the police, the authorities said yesterday. After the suspect, Ramel Simmons, 23, had been tracked to the apartment, New York City and Albany police officers arrived to arrest him, the police said. After no response to police calls for two hours, tear gas was fired inside, and a fiber-optic camera showed Mr. Simmons dead on the floor with a 9-millimeter handgun, the police said. It is unclear whether Mr. Simmons shot himself before the police arrived or after the tear gas was used, the police said. The police had identified Mr. Simmons as one of two men who opened fire in the Galaxy Diner in East New York on Jan. 17, sending customers diving under tables for cover before taking jewelry and money and fleeing. Another suspect, Mark Blount of East New York, was arrested the following week. The police are seeking a third suspect, possibly a driver, an investigator said.
