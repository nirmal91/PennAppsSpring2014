The national lotteries of France, Spain and Britain announced a joint weekly lottery game called Euro Millions. The first drawing will be held on Feb. 13, with a starting jackpot of 15 million euros, or $18.88 million. Although tickets may be purchased in pounds in Britain, Christophe Blanchard-Dignac, chairman of Fran√ßaise des Jeux, the French lottery company, said, ''Betting is a good way for the British to get closer to the euro.''
