Mike Vogel, chairman and chief executive for the last three years at the Troy, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide, is retiring, the agency said. His successor was hired from another shop in the Detroit market.
Mr. Vogel, 57, joined the office in December 2000 from what had been the Detroit-area office of Foote Cone &amp; Belding, now part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as BBDO absorbed the Foote Cone operation. Joseph Garcia, 40, is assuming Mr. Vogel's duties at BBDO with the title of president, a new post. He had been global business development director at Chemistri in Troy, Mich., an agency owned by the Publicis Groupe that works on General Motors accounts.
BBDO is also promoting Peter Swiecicki, 45, chief financial officer, to chief operating officer, a new post. BBDO, part of the Omnicom Group, said Mr. Vogel would help for the next three months with the management transition in Troy.
