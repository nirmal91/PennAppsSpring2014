Martin Mull, who is more widely known as a comedian and television star, is also a painter with a 1967 M.F.A. from the Rhode Island School of Design. The paintings in his seventh New York solo show reflect the influences of David Salle and Gerhard Richter, but they combine mood and subject matter to genuinely moving effect.
Based on old photographs, illustrations and wallpaper, the paintings meditate on suburban America in the 1950's -- that is, on the artist's own childhood. Romantic nostalgia is offset by Pop Art-style irony. (James Rosenquist is in the mix, too.) And feelings of loss, disconnection and fear prevail.
In ''Silverdale II'' a glum-looking blond woman and a colorful pile of toys are painted in sharp focus over the smeared image of a ranch house. There is a vague feeling of dread, like that in a David Lynch movie; maybe that ghostly woman was murdered inside the dark, blurry house.
There are intimations of violence in other pictures, too, like that of a girl walking a balance beam above a charging locomotive and the all-gray one of a girl dancing with a scary-looking clown -- a child molester? -- outside another lonely ranch house.
In several cases Mr. Mull surrounds the central scene with wide painted borders based on floral or plaid wallpaper. It's not an innovative device, but it is an effective reminder of how the domestic cocoon may fail to protect against the terrors that lurk within.
