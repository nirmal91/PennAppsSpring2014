To the Editor:
I represent 2,450 New York City fire officers. We take issue with Clyde Haberman's reference to an average 11-second increase in firefighter response time as ''a slight rise'' (NYC column, Jan. 30).
Other words spring to mind, like stunning, worrisome, frightening or life-threatening.
It doesn't take 11 seconds for a fireball to kill everyone in its path. It doesn't take 11 seconds for a floor or a ceiling to collapse.
Eleven seconds could be the difference between living and dying.
