Maccarone  45 Canal Street, Lower East Side  Through Feb. 22
Mass media celebrity is a phenomenon so fantastic and bizarre that art can do nothing more effective with it than frame existing images, as Chivas Clem does in this mordant solo show. Most of his images are photographs culled from journalistic sources and gain a certain weight and mystery recycled in a gallery setting.
A woman who looks blindfolded or veiled -- she brings to mind figures dressed in burkas or the mourning Jacqueline Kennedy -- is actually Monica Lewinsky, her face obscured by a baseball cap bill. A newspaper photograph of a captive Taliban hangs beside an auction catalog reproduction of Andy Warhol's portrait of O. J. Simpson. In both pictures the subjects are bearded and stare intently into the camera, and their pairing stirs up interesting ideas about the slipperiness of categories like aggressor and victim.
Criminality is a recurrent subtext in the show, linked to homosexuality and art. A photographed portrait drawing of the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer incorporates a drawing of van Gogh's ear. A shot of art books on shelves was taken in the apartment of Andrew Cunanan, the murderer of Gianni Versace. Mr. Clem gives the title ''Self Portrait'' to a film still of the transvestite killer from the film ''Silence of the Lambs.''
And he appears himself in the show's one video, where he is seen hurling himself into the path of a subway train. The video is a shrewd update on the famous photograph of the artist Yves Klein apparently performing a suicidal swan dive from a rooftop. It is also an enactment of a subway suicide that Mr. Clem witnessed last summer. In his film version, a terrible act of real-life self-destruction is replayed as a fiction within a fiction on a much-diminished contemporary version of the silver screen.
