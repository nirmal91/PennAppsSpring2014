To the Editor:
''Gaza First'' (editorial, Feb. 4) points out Israel's historical shortcomings and current requirements regarding Gaza and an overall peace settlement. Conspicuously absent is any mention of Palestinian responsibility.
You say that for a Palestinian state to be viable, it must ''be made up of the entire West Bank and Gaza, with small adjustments.''
I would have thought that for a Palestinian state to be viable, it would need to confront and defeat terrorism, have transparent financial dealings, stop hate-mongering against Israel and Jews, and have democratically elected leaders.
Dealing with geography alone is not enough.
