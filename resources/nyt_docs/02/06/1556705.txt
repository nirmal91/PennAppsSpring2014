The fast-growing Canadian discount airline WestJet said that it planned to start scheduled service to several United States cities later this year in competition with Air Canada. WestJet, based in Calgary, also announced more than 100 extra domestic flights a week. With operating costs about half those of Air Canada, WestJet has gained significant market share since it started flying in 1996. Another low-cost Canadian carrier, Jetsgo of Montreal, also announced expanded services, with the purchase of 18 Fokker 100 aircraft from American Airlines.
