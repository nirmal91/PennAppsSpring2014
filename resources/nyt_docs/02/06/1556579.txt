An article last Friday about a man's affection for his 1958 Lincoln Continental Mark III convertible misstated the number of those convertibles made in that model year. It was 3,048, not 2,000. A related article, on the history of the Continental, misstated the number of 2002 Continentals made. It was 19,630 (6,927 was the number of 2002 models manufactured in calendar year 2001).
