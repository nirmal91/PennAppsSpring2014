A rare confluence of stormy weather and a large run of fish is being blamed for the deaths of thousands of sardines at the San Onofre nuclear power plant north of San Diego. About 13,590 pounds of sardines, which were apparently swimming close to shore to avoid rough seas, were killed in San Onofre's 1.7 million-gallon-a-minute ocean water cooling system. The death toll was probably the largest in the plant's history, a spokesman for Southern California Edison said. On a typical day, the cooling system kills about 200 pounds of fish.
