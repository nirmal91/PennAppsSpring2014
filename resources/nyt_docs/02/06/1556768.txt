Artists are a finicky bunch, but ''Endless Love,'' an ecumenical but uneven group show organized by the painter Mark Greenwold, deals in extreme cases. Cutting across stylistic and generational divisions, it brings together work that telegraphs time-consuming technique, whether contemplative, workmanlike or obsessive.
Examples range from well-known figures like Alfred Jensen, Myron Stout and Giorgio Morandi to young and youngish artists like Lucky DeBellevue and Hilary Harkness. In between are Steve DiBenedetto, JoAnne Carson, Scott Brodie, Thomas Nozkowski and Jim Nutt.
Mr. Greenwold, who paints small, obsessively detailed scenes of domestic crisis, means to defend art-making as a painstaking, devotional process and to challenge what he calls, in the show's brochure, ''the modernist bias against taking a long time.'' Never mind that the efforts of modernists from Mondrian to Agnes Martin refute this generalization.
At a moment when fussy and detail-laden art is in vogue, the show reminds us that physical process is an important aspect of content, but that it can also obscure a lack of originality with evident quantities of time, control or patience.
The show is most interesting for its lively juxtapositions: the quavering grid and eccentric biomorphism of Mr. Nozkowski's untitled painting, next to the compressed linear meanderings of James Siena's enamel-on-aluminum ''Coffered Unknot,'' next to the fine-pored skin of many colors and the multi-lobed form of ''Zooz,'' a recent sculpture by Ken Price.
