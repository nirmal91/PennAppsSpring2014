To the Editor:
Re ''Massachusetts Gives New Push to Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 5):
I have two stepchildren whose biological mother is gay. She and her partner of 10 years have raised two of the most well-adjusted, intelligent and caring kids I know.
The thought that my stepchildren could experience institutionalized discrimination because of the sexual orientation of their mother makes me angry.
I commend the Massachusetts court for standing up for the values expressed in the State Constitution, and I hope that the United States Supreme Court has the courage to do the same, when the time comes.
