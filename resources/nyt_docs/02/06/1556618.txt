To the Editor:
Re ''Costs and Savings in Medicare Change on Wheelchairs'' (news article, Jan. 30), about tightened eligibility requirements for power wheelchairs:
While many cases of fraud demand action, they should not require a meat ax. Power chairs are popular because they significantly improve quality of life and independence for the severely disabled.
As a paraplegic with significant skeletal and kidney problems, I could not be living independently without such a chair. Because of it, I can do my daily errands, eat out with friends, shop for food and generally have a life. The new policy, thus, may represent a serious setback to the independent living movement for people with disabilities.
