If you have time to see just one New York gallery exhibition this month, this knee-buckling selection of paintings by Mark Rothko from the year 1949 should be it.
By 1949 Rothko had left behind the more traditional representational painting of the 30's and the Surrealist work of the 40's; he was into pure abstraction -- a flattened, glowing, soft-focused kind of Cubism.
This is the year that he finally broke free of the obligation to make interestingly varied compositions and discovered the power of large, simple, symmetrically ordered blocks of color. He began to make the paintings that we now view as classic Rothkos.
So part of the excitement is seeing the moment when an artist dares to become fully himself. The other part is sheer beauty. Rothko came to be thought of as a tragic visionary, but with this set of pictures he seems an ecstatic hedonist drunk on color, tropical light and the erotic touch of brush on canvas. You may feel intimations of cosmic poetry, but the thrill is mainly sensory.
Here in diaphanous washy fields, there in throbbing opaque blocks, color appears shamelessly savory: blackberry, plum, watermelon, mango, blueberry and buttery yellow. Rothko varies and balances darks and lights and warmth and coolness like a master chef. It's hard to believe that such unabashedly voluptuous work was made on the eve of the decade of gray flannel repression, cold war and nuclear fear.
