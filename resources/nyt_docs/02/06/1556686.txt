To the Editor:
Call it capitulation, call it misguided faith, call it desperation, call it eagerness to please Washington, but please don't call it sanity for Israel to uproot thousands of Jews from their homes and their lives without receiving anything in return (''Gaza First,'' editorial, Feb. 4).
Sanity would be concessions based on a complete and lasting cessation of Palestinian terror and incitement. Anything less is just plain crazy.
