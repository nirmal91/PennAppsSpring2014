Additional tests on a gray powder found in a Wallingford mail distribution center have turned up no threatening biological agents, the State Department of Public Health said yesterday. The department would not say what the substance was, but law enforcement officials identified it as wood ash. The substance was discovered on Monday when it leaked out of an envelope addressed to the Republican National Committee, the same day a white powder identified as ricin, a deadly poison, was found in a Senate mailroom in Washington. Previous tests on the Wallingford powder determined that it was not ricin. In 2001, a Wallingford mechanical mail sorter was contaminated with anthrax spores, which were found in a letter opened by a 94-year-old woman in Oxford, who later died.
