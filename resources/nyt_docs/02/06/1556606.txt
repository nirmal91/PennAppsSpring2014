DURING the winter, most visitors to Utah come to sample ''the Greatest Snow on Earth,'' and for those people, Utah's capital, Salt Lake City, is little more than a convenient way station. But a visit to Utah is really not complete without spending some time in this sprawling historic city. Situated directly below the towering Wasatch Front, Salt Lake might have the most spectacular scenery of any metropolis in the nation. It also has beautiful 1900's neighborhoods, hip restaurants, a large array of antiques shops and is, of course, the spiritual center of the Mormon Church. Nonskiers and those taking a day off from the slopes can spend a fascinating, even otherworldly, weekend in the town that Brigham Young and 147 weary pioneers established in 1847. But first some practical advice. The city is built on a grid, and streets radiate outward from Temple Square and are designated by hundreds. For example, 100 South is the first street south of the square; 100 East, the first to the east. Locals would call the intersection of 300 East and 300 South ''Third East and Third South.''

Friday
6 p.m.  1. It's Cold Out; Eat In  While there are plenty of reasons to spend a night at the newly renovated Hotel Monaco, the best might be its restaurant, Bambara (202 South Main Street, 801-363-5454). A stylish yet casual bistro and bar, Bambara has quickly established one of the more creative menus in town. For an appetizer, try the wild mushroom and chevre strudel with sweet onion jam ($8), followed by corn bread-stuffed chicken breast and roasted-garlic mashed potatoes ($18) or a dish of pan-seared Maine scallops with celery root purée and leek fondue ($22).
8 p.m.  2. Broadway and Opera Go West  Just down the block from the Monaco, the 1,800-seat Capitol Theater (50 West 200 South, 801-355-2787) originally opened as the Orpheum in 1913 and was host to the top entertainers and vaudeville acts of the day. Now the restored Beaux-Arts theater is home to visiting Broadway shows, the Utah Opera and local dance companies like Ririe-Woodbury. Coming soon: ''Oklahoma'' and ''The Girl of the Golden West.''
Saturday
8:30 a.m.  3. A Browser's Breakfast  On your way to the Oasis Cafe (151 South 500 East, 801-322-0404) for breakfast, take a detour to East South Temple Street and drive a few blocks north into the neighborhoods around E through J Streets. You might just decide that one of the affordable century-old houses would make a good home. The Oasis is a bustling, wood-grained establishment filled with skiers, hippies and intellectuals (the New Age Golden Braid Bookstore is next door). You could do far worse than the cranberry-sourdough French toast ($7.60) or German buttermilk pancakes with fresh blueberries ($7.45).
10:30 a.m.  4. In With the Old  After breakfast, take a three-block walk to 300 East and 300 South. Here you'll find antiques dealers jumbled together in 17,000 square feet of bygone nirvana at shops like Carmen Miranda's and Salt Lake Antiques. Jitterbug Toys (279 East 300 South, 801-537-7038) is crammed with vintage Hot Wheels, original G.I. Joes (a good one runs about $125) plus Lionel trains, Tonka trucks and Tinkertoys. Ken Sanders Rare Books (268 South 200 East, 801-521-3819) has more than 200,000 volumes, all chosen by Mr. Sanders. One of his gems: an 1830 first edition of ''The Book of Mormon,'' the writings upon which Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
1 p.m.  5. Midday, With Cheese  Carlucci's Bakery (314 West 300 South, 801-366-4484) is a charming, quiet little corner cafe in the Pierpont District. Try the tomato basil soup with grilled cheese on nine-grain bread as prepared by the owner and chef Therese Roper ($5.95). Or you might also opt for the portobello on focaccia ($5.95) or the Black Forest ham and brie sandwich ($5.50). Save room for an arborio rice pudding with dried cherries ($3.50) and grab one of the excellent coffee drinks to go.
2 p.m.  6. A Gallery Crawl  Latte in hand, stroll tiny, funky Pierpont Avenue. Art Access (339 West Pierpont Avenue, 801-328-0703), specializes in jury shows for disadvantaged and disabled artists. Just down Pierpont is Elementé, with 5,500 square feet of retro furniture (353 West Pierpont Avenue, 801-355-7400). Here, you might find a gooseneck floor lamp for $38 or a pair of eight-foot 15-paned French doors for $250. A block away, the 4,000-square-foot Artspace Forum (511 West 200 South, 801-521-5999) is one of the city's top independent showcases for Southwest artists.
3 p.m.  7. The Celestial Kingdom  The 35-acre Temple Square is Utah's No. 1 tourist attraction, as well as the epicenter of the Mormon Church. At the South Visitors' Center just off South Temple Street, you can pick up a map of the square and take a touch-screen tour showing the construction of the main temple (it took more than 40 years to complete). If you're not a confirmed Mormon, you won't be allowed inside, but you can get a good idea of the interior by visiting the smaller Assembly Hall, built in 1880 with granite left over from construction of the temple. At the North Visitors' Center, biblical events are presented on film, and there is a 15-minute movie that depicts the creation of the church. After Joseph Smith was killed in 1844 in Illinois, Brigham Young emerged as the head of the church. His home, Beehive House (67 East South Temple Street), is on the National Register of Historic Places. Because Mormon belief holds that the souls of the dead can be saved by living relatives, the church maintains the Family History Library (35 North West Temple), one of the largest caches of genealogical records in the world. You can research your ancestry until 10 p.m. on Saturdays.
8:30 p.m.  8. Iguanaritaville  More earthly delights are available around the corner from Temple Square at the Blue Iguana (165 South West Temple, 801-533-8900). The chef, Manuel Castillo, offers more than seven types of mole with chicken or steak, rice and peas and tortillas ($14). Combination platters run from $9 to $12, and the bar serves a variety of ''Iguanaritas'' and Mexican beers.
Sunday
9 a.m.  9. Voices on High  Almost every Sunday morning the 360 volunteer members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sing at the Tabernacle in Temple Square. The egg-shaped hall, with its 150-foot roof span is an acoustical marvel (tour guides are found of dropping a pin on the stage to demonstrate just how well sound carries), and the nearly 12,000-pipe organ is among the largest in the world. Concerts are broadcast from 9:30 to 10 a.m., but you need to be in your seat by 9:15. Admission is free. (No one under 6 is allowed.)
10:30 a.m.  10. A Quiet Brunch  The Park Cafe (604 East 1300 South, 801-487-1670) sits on the edge of 80-acre Liberty Park, a place of towering cottonwoods, cross-country skiers and the seven-acre Tracy Aviary, home of 400 birds. Situated in a house at the south entrance of the park, the 50-seat cafe's walls are covered with paintings by local artists. The Sunday morning clientele mirrors Salt Lake's diverse population of skiers, artists, yuppies and churchgoers. The Mexican hash ($6.75) is made with chorizo, onions, potatoes and eggs with tortillas, while egg dishes like the fresh herb scramble ($5.95) come with a fresh biscuit and house potatoes.
Noon  11. The Downhill Slide  This has been the snowiest Utah winter in decades, and it's a shame to waste all that powder. Nonskiers can pick up a plastic slider at a discount store and make tracks for the 180-acre Sugar House Park (1300 East 2100 South, 801-483-5473), but they will have to walk up the 100-yard hill. At Gorgoza Park (3863 West Kilby Road, Parley's Canyon), 20 minutes east of downtown on Interstate 80, there's a lift-served inner-tube sledding hill, with runs of 600 to 1000 feet. Two hours is $8 a slider, tube included.
THE BASICS  Visiting Salt Lake City
Salt Lake City International Airport is served by most major airlines and rental-car companies. It is a 10-minute drive from downtown.
Built in 1926, the Art Deco Hotel Monaco (15 West 200 South, 877-294-9710) is in the heart of downtown. The 225-room hotel allows pets; if you haven't brought your own, the Monaco will supply a goldfish in a bowl. Weekend rates run from $169 to $235.
The Armstrong Mansion Bed and Breakfast (667 East 100 South, 800-708-1333) has just 15 rooms and offers skiing and dining weekend packages for $349, including dinner and a day's lift ticket. Rooms start at $99, with breakfast.
