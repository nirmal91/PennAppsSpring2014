New Jersey child welfare officials announced yesterday that they would spend $10 million to treat parents under the state's jurisdiction who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. James M. Davy, the acting human services commissioner, said the state would treat about 2,500 families during the next year. The money includes about $3 million previously set aside for drug treatment. The announcement came a day after an independent panel offered a mixed appraisal of the state's progress in meeting the terms of a legal settlement that called for a sweeping overhaul of the Division of Youth and Family Services. The panel questioned the state's plans to reduce caseloads for workers and find placements for children in the system.
