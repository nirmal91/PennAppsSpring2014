The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that a teacher who wrote a series of anti-gay letters published in a local newspaper was not wrongfully punished in receiving a one-month suspension. Chris Kempling, a guidance counselor at a high school in Quesnel, argued that his suspension was a violation of his freedoms. The court found the letters to be discriminatory and the suspension just, saying that a public school teacher should be held to more stringent standards than the general public.
