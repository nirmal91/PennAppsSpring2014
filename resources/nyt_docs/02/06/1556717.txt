Governments and relief groups were asked at a donors conference at the United Nations to contribute $488 million in aid to help rebuild Liberia, which has had 14 years of relentless war and is now under fragile transitional rule. ''Liberia, once classified in the 1970's as a middle-income country, is now considered a failed state,'' said Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell addresses the group today and will outline an expected American pledge of $200 million.
