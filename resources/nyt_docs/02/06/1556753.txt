A New Jersey state trooper, racing in his patrol car to close the net around a fleeing robbery suspect, died about 3 a.m. yesterday when he struck a utility pole in rural Cape May County in southern New Jersey.
Trooper Bertram Zimmerman III, 32, of Gloucester Township, was killed when he crashed three miles from a Dennis Township convenience store that had been robbed by a man who fled in a Lincoln Town Car.
The trooper was traveling on State Road 83 to its intersection with Route 9, the road the suspect was on, said Sgt. Kevin Rehmann, a state police spokesman.
Investigators had not determined the cause of the accident or how fast Trooper Zimmerman was traveling.
Other troopers eventually captured the suspect, but he had yet to be charged as of late yesterday, the police said. His name was not released.
Trooper Zimmerman is the 63rd officer to die while on duty in the 82-year history of the New Jersey State Police. Most have died in traffic accidents. Before yesterday's accident, the last death was in December 2002 when a truck hit an officer on radar duty who had stepped off the median of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Trooper Zimmerman, who had been on the state police force for three years, was assigned to the elite Tactical Patrol Unit. He was staking out another convenience store yesterday as part of the state police effort to halt a rash of robberies.
Since December, eight convenience stores have been robbed in the area, Sergeant Rehmann said. He said the police suspected the same man committed all the robberies .
Troopers had been deployed in the area in an effort to catch the robber in the act. Trooper Zimmerman had been stationed at a convenience store in Dennisville, nine miles from where the robbery occurred.
Gov. James E. McGreevey visited Trooper Zimmerman's wife of six months and his mother yesterday to offer condolences. The State Assembly observed a moment of silence in his memory.
