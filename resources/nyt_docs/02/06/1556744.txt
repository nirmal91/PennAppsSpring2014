A Brooklyn high school principal was taken to the hospital yesterday after he was knocked down in the hallway by a student trying to flee from the police, the authorities said. The principal, Alan J. Siegel of Lafayette High School, was released from the hospital several hours later, officials said.
The authorities said the student, identified as Michael Theobalds, 17, kept running after knocking Mr. Siegel down but was soon caught and arrested outside the school.
Officials said Mr. Theobalds was called into the deans' office about 10 a.m. yesterday after two students identified him as having robbed them at school on Tuesday. When a police officer tried to arrest Mr. Theobalds, the authorities said, he pushed the officer, bolted from the deans' office and crashed into Mr. Siegel, who was standing in the hall.
Teachers said that Mr. Siegel's head hit the floor with a loud thud and that he looked dazed and glassy-eyed. He was taken to Maimonides Medical Center, where he was examined, and released about 2:30 p.m.
Mr. Theobalds was charged with robbery, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, said Detective Thomas Kuchma, a Police Department spokesman. Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Education, said a suspension was pending.
Mr. Siegel, who graduated from Lafayette in 1964, was brought back to his alma mater three years ago to restore order. The school, at 2630 Benson Avenue, was not among the 12 recently named by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as the city's most unruly.
Yesterday, students described him as a strict disciplinarian. ''It's not the greatest school, but it has improved under him somewhat,'' said Vinny Osorio, 18, a senior. ''He's gotten some bad kids thrown out.''
