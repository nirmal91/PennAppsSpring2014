James Cohan Gallery  533 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through Feb. 14
''The Game Show'' doesn't do complete justice to its theme -- it would take a museum show to do that -- but it does get you thinking about the kinds of relationships there are between games and art.
Some artists turn the process of making art into a game. For his gridded wall drawing, Sol LeWitt provided instructions for a game of chance in which the executors would draw from a hat choices for inscribing white chalk lines (diagonal, curved, vertical, horizontal, etc.) into black squares. Some artists like to break rules: Nikki S. Lee violates the rules of fine-art photography in fake snapshots of herself as a fictional character with half the picture cut away to remove a male companion.
Some works simply represent games or sports, like Andreas Gursky's giant aerial photograph of a soccer game. Yinka Shonibare's arrangement of headless child-size mannequins on a hopscotch court, dressed in European-style clothes made from African fabrics, invokes the game as an oblique political metaphor.
And then there are artists for whom the arena or playing field is not the canvas or the studio but the art world. So Mike Kelley's abject stuffed animals on a stained baby blanket or Jeff Koons's basketballs hovering in an aquarium are best understood as moves on the sociological game board that is the competitive contemporary art system.
So, too, Jonathan Borofsky's Ping-Pong table, where viewers are actually invited to play. Leaving this exhibition, you may wonder, Is art ever not a game?
