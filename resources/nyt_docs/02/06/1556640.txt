President Bush avoids most of the inconveniences that plague ordinary air travelers, like delays, lines and baggage searches. But on Thursday he got a taste of one: an aborted landing approach.
In early afternoon, returning from South Carolina, the pilot of Air Force One was forced by a vehicle on the runway at Andrews Air Force Base to pull up and circle for a second effort to land the president's plane.
The Air Force said it was ''routine,'' and it certainly felt that way. Reporters in the back of the plane barely noticed.
But given the security that surrounds the president's comings and goings, it was a highly unusual event, especially on a clear day.
Mr. Bush seemed unperturbed when he got off the plane. But one White House official on the plane noted later that the plane ''had a smoother time getting into Baghdad'' on the president's secret Thanksgiving trip.
