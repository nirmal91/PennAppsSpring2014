Co-op City, the sprawling apartment complex in the Bronx that has fallen into disrepair and debt, will get a $14 million property tax break over the next two decades to help it make the repairs it needs, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday. The mayor said the city had altered its rules to allow the 15,372-unit complex to qualify for tax benefits in return for making repairs. Even with the tax break, officials said, tenants will still have to pay higher maintenance fees to pay for the repairs.
