To the Editor:
Re ''Subway Headache: MetroCard Devices Often Need Repairs'' (front page, Feb. 3):
Charming as tokens (particularly the old cutouts) were, the idea that MetroCards are less efficient than their minted forebears makes little sense. A line is a line, whether it's for a token or a card.
Even in the numismatic halcyon days, if you had no tokens when you got to the station, you had to wait in line and miss your train.
And how many buses did we miss because those vitamin-colored transfer slips vanished into our back pockets, were chewed up by our keys or melted in the rain?
None if we'd just taken the subway, because subway-bus transfers weren't possible.
You report that there are 1,637 MetroCard machines: that's 1,637 new places to buy subway rides. Even if we take into account the 800 times per day that transit workers are called in for repairs, and the 45 shuttered token booths, there are still many more places to buy rides now than there were pre-MetroCard.
This is further proof that the urge to carp predates both the token and the MetroCard as a staple of New York straphanger culture.
