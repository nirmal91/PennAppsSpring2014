To the Editor:
Re ''Can the Heavens Wait?,'' by Michael Benson (Op-Ed, Jan. 31):
NASA did not make the difficult, but necessary, decision to cancel the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission for financial reasons, as Mr. Benson suggests. Safety was the issue. We could not justify risking the lives of seven astronauts on such a mission, given the increased safety requirements recommended by the Columbia accident inquiry board.
Launched in 1990 for a 15-year mission, the Hubble will soon surpass its projected lifetime just as it has surpassed scientific expectations.
We are proud of the Hubble's accomplishments and of the scientists and engineers who made them possible. We are focusing the same talent on extending the life of the Hubble as long as we can and on building other telescopes that will examine the universe in ways the Hubble could not.
