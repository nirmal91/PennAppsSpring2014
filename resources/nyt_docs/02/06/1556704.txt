The strengthening Australian dollar helped Singapore Telecommunications nearly triple its net profit in its most recent quarter. The company, known as SingTel, said net profit in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was its fiscal third quarter, rose about 188 percent, to 854 million Singapore dollars ($504 million), helped by a foreign exchange gain of 223 million Singapore dollars from loans denominated in Australian dollars to its Australian subsidiary Optus. SingTel now counts on overseas units for 77 percent of its group revenues.
