An article on Feb. 10 about a federal hearing on the relationship between autism and thimerosal, a preservative once common in childhood vaccines, referred incorrectly to a study in the journal Pediatrics that some toxicologists and parent groups have interpreted as suggesting a link. It was published in November, not this month; its subjects were children in several H.M.O.'s in California and Massachusetts, not in the Atlanta area. (A second autism study, carried out in the Atlanta area, appeared in Pediatrics this month.)
