Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, pelted with questions about the gay marriage issue, declined yesterday to say whether or not he supports the idea of such unions. But he reiterated his belief that there was no need for the constitutional amendment proposed by President Bush, saying the matter should be left up to states.
''I believe it is up to the states, not to the federal government,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in the Bronx. ''The president seems to call for a constitutional amendment. I don't think we need a constitutional amendment.''
The mayor declined to respond to further questions about his beliefs on gay marriage.
On Tuesday, President Bush said he would like an amendment to the Constitution that would ban gay marriage, saying the union of a man and a woman is ''the most fundamental institution of civilization.'' Mr. Bloomberg's position on the amendment is his first major departure from the president on a policy issue.
In 2002, the mayor signed Local Law 24, which recognizes civil unions legally entered into in other jurisdictions. But because marriages between people of the same sex are not permitted under New York State law, the mayor will not ask the city clerk to issue licenses to gay couples, said Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, Edward Skyler.
Mr. Bloomberg has placed himself in an interesting position with gay voters. By going against the president, he endears himself to those who oppose a constitutional amendment. But many gay voters may wish for him to express stronger support for the states to permit gay marriages.
''It's wonderful news that the mayor has publicly spoken out against this amendment,'' said Alan Van Capelle, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, one of the largest gay organizations in the country. ''We think it's important that New Yorkers hear from their mayor on this issue.''
