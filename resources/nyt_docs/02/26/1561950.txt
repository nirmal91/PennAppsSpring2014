The government said that 18.3 percent fewer American tourists visited France last year, a bigger drop than in 2002, when American visitors dropped by 15.3 percent. Over all, two million fewer tourists visited the country, a decrease of 2.6 percent since 2002. The government said currency exchange rates, a summer heat wave and wild fires kept foreigners away.
