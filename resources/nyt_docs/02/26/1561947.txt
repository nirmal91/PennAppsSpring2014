The police were hunting for the killer an air-traffic controller who was on duty at Zurich airport when two planes collided over southern Germany in July 2002, killing 71 people, mostly Russian schoolchildren. The authorities suspect a revenge killing. The controller, a 36-year-old Dane, has never been named. He was stabbed to death at his home in Zurich.
