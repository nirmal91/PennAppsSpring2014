A fire broke out at the East Jersey State Prison yesterday, destroying a barracks and forcing the evacuation of nearly 100 minimum-security inmates, officials said. No injuries were reported. The inmates were moved to the gymnasium in the prison's main building. Matt Schuman, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Corrections, said the cause of the fire was under investigation. Prison officials had not decided whether to house the inmates elsewhere in the prison or relocate them to a different prison.
