To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Ban in Constitution on Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 25):
The proposed amendment would do grave harm to many and nothing to protect marriage. The amendment would not only forbid gay marriage but would deny its ''legal incidents.''
That could include health benefits, hospital visitation, inheritance, child custody and much more.
In more than 20 years of pastoral ministry, I have seen many threats to marriage, but these threats haven't come from gay men and lesbians. I'm certain that a survey of pastors, priests and rabbis would confirm that adultery, abuse and addictions are far more destructive.
Economic hardship could be added to the list.
There are many people of faith whose voices haven't been heard in this debate. Now is the time for more of us to speak.
