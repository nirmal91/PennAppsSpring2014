The New York Police Department said it was searching for a young woman who has been missing since Friday night after she left her college dormitory in Dutchess County to visit her parents in Brooklyn.
The woman, Melissa Kennedy, 21, a Bard College senior, was last seen on Friday night after her friend dropped her off at the Metro-North station in Poughkeepsie, said her mother, Janet Kennedy.
But she was not on the train when it arrived in Grand Central Terminal just after 10:15 p.m.
''It's kind of like a nightmare going through it, but we're trying to be positive,'' Mrs. Kennedy said.
On Sunday, the missing woman's father, George Kennedy, received a telephone call from his missing daughter's cellphone, but the connection was immediately cut off, and he got no answer when he returned the call, Mrs. Kennedy said.
