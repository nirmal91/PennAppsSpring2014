It's easy to miss a cellphone call when you're at home and the cellphone is turned off or happens to be in another room when it rings.
Now, Cidco's Merge ($99) integrates your cellphone and home phones so that you can receive both land-line and cellular calls (taking advantage of your free minutes) from any extension in your house. You can tell from distinctive rings which phone number is being called. Interchangeable modules enable the charger base to support most popular cellphones; additional modules are $20 apiece.
Merge, which cellphone suppliers are expected to begin offering this spring, works with any home phone and allows the full use of call waiting, voice dialing and other services.
The distinctive rings offer the advantage of alerting you to cellphone calls that you would rather not answer but want to be aware of while you are at home.
