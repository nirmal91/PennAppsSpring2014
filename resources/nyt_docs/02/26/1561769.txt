When Hollywood and Highland, above, a complex including movie theaters, shops, restaurants and the Kodak Theater (where the Oscars will be held on Sunday) opened just over two years ago, it was expected to be the crown in the revival of Hollywood Boulevard. But it has proved to be a white elephant bigger than those atop its fake Babylonian towers. The owners, Trizec Properties, are selling it to the CIM Group for around $200 million. (It was once said to be worth more than $600 million.) The CIM Group hopes to turn Hollywood and Highland around, but it faces a serious challenge. Not only did the project suffer from a dramatic downturn in the economy and initially annoy drivers with expensive parking, but it wavered between the theatrical and the tasteful: ''It looks like it was designed by some Romanians based on a postcard of Las Vegas,'' said the Los Angeles architecture critic Michael Webb. And the development largely faces away from one of the few streets in Los Angeles that has a lot of foot traffic. ''Hollywood is about its pedestrian night life,'' said Rose Apodaca Jones, the West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily and a co-owner of three popular Hollywood bars. In the Hollywood and Highland complex, she said, ''you are trapped.''
But John Given, a principal in the CIM Group, is undaunted. Citing the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel (an adjoining building included in the sale), the 65,000 square feet of banquet and meeting space managed by the chef Wolfgang Puck, and busy spots like the Highlands club and the Lucky Strike Lanes bowling alley, he says that the project can still be a catalyst for the continued revival of Hollywood. Meanwhile, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says it is committed to the remaining 17 years on its contract to produce the Oscar telecast at the Kodak Theater, designed by David Rockwell.
