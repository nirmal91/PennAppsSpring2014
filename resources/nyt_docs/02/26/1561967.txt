After a 17-month investigation, federal prosecutors filed charges yesterday against 30 members of two Staten Island gangs they said were involved in crack cocaine sales and gang battles that involved at least six shootings. Prosecutors said the Deuce Mob sold crack from a front porch in the Port Richmond area. The investigation of the rival Mob-Up crew, the prosecutors said, included a shooting by a gang member that was captured on a surveillance video camera.
