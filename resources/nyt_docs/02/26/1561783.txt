A set of low-cost devices to be introduced this spring can operate every audio and video component in the house -- even from outdoors.
Well-known companies like Philips Electronics and Sony make inexpensive universal remotes that are designed to replace the array of devices that litters many a coffee table. But Scott Wellington, the marketing manager for Universal Remote Control, says the three models introduced by his company are the only ones in the $100-to-$200 range that can transmit radio frequency signals. Equipped with an optional $75 receiver, the MRF-100, the remotes can control TV's, CD players and other devices from as far as 150 feet, even from behind a closed door.
That may seem like a solution in search of a problem. But Mr. Wellington points out that it is not always convenient to go to another room to change a CD that is being piped through distant speakers.
The Universal Remote Control URC-300 ($200) has a liquid crystal display touch screen that can be customized to replace 15 other remotes.
That device and its siblings, the URC-100 ($100) and URC-200 ($150), are to reach electronics stores in April. They can all store macros, strings of programming commands that with the touch of one button will turn on the right appliance and select the proper input to play a DVD or CD or watch TV.
Each model comes with an instructional DVD, increasing the chances that today's couch potato will turn into tomorrow's patio potato.
