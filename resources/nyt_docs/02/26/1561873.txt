Final election results announced by the government on Wednesday confirmed that Iran's religious conservatives made significant gains in Parliamentary balloting on Friday, which reformists had previously dismissed as illegitimate.
Hard-line opponents of President Mohammad Khatami won an overwhelming majority of the seats at stake, even in liberal Tehran, bringing their total to 156 in the 290-seat assembly, the reformist-controlled Interior Ministry announced on its Web site. Another 50 seats will be decided later this year.
Turnout was as low as 28 percent in Tehran, including 16 percent of ballots voided because of mistakes or because they were deliberately left blank, according to the Interior Ministry. State television, which is controlled by the conservatives, reported a nationwide turnout of 60 percent.
A leading reformist candidate and the speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, who failed to win enough votes, pulled out of the race on Wednesday.
The conservative group that won the race in Tehran, Developers of Islamic Iran, announced its victory on Tuesday and vowed to revive economic growth and limit social freedoms.
Mr. Hadad Adel's total of 870,000 votes represented about 13 percent of Tehran's electorate. The top vote getter in the last Parliamentary elections garnered 1.8 million votes.
