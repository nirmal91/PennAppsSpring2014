The mouth of the Mississippi River partly reopened to traffic after a supply vessel that sank after a collision on Saturday was moved aside, the Coast Guard in New Orleans said. Officials still do not know when the vessel, the Lee III, will be raised and traffic fully restored, but they are slowly clearing a logjam of more than 100 ships. Of five missing crew members, one has been recovered and the bodies of two were seen by divers.
