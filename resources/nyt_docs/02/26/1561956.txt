ChevronTexaco said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire one of the office towers built by the Enron Corporation and consolidate most of its operations in Houston. ChevronTexaco, based in San Ramon, Calif., said it planned to relocate about 500 employees from offices in New Orleans, Northern California and Midland, Tex., to the building, which is expected to eventually house about 3,700 employees. Enron, which sought bankruptcy-court protection in 2001, never occupied the building that was designed by the architect Cesar Pelli and built at an estimated cost of $300 million. ChevronTexaco did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but the city of Houston said the company would pay taxes on an estimated base value for the building of about $80 million. The seller, Intell Management and Investment of New York, paid $102 million for the building in 2002. Enron's other building was bought by a group of investors last December for $55.5 million.
