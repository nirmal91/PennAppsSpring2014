The police released the sketch at left yesterday of a woman wanted for questioning in connection with an abandoned baby boy found Tuesday in a Harlem office building. The woman was described by witnesses as 25 to 30 years old, 5 feet 5 or 5 feet 6 inches tall and with shoulder-length hair in a ponytail. She was wearing a gray sweatshirt with blue lettering. The baby was left in a leather handbag in the third-floor hallway of the building, at 127 West 127th Street. Infant abandonment is illegal unless the baby is left at a safe haven like a hospital or police station.
