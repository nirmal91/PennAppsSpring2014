The operators of La Guardia Airport said yesterday that they had begun soliciting bids from companies to provide ferry service to the airport from downtown Manhattan. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates the airport, will select a ferry operator later this year, a spokesman said. New York Waterway ran a ferry service to La Guardia's Marine Air Terminal, but discontinued it. The company recently submitted a proposal for the planned service, a company spokesman said last night. Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. said he hoped the service would help kill a plan to extend the N subway line to the airport, which he said would put a ''horrible, loud, noisy ugly elevated train line through the heart of a vibrant Astoria community.'' Mr. Vallone said he was told that the planned ferry service could begin by the end of the year and connect to airport buses with routes to terminals.
