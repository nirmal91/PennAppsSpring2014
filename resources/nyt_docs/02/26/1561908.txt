To the Editor:
Re ''Putting Bias in the Constitution'' (editorial, Feb. 25):
President Bush, like millions of his fellow Americans, is opposed to legally changing the definition of marriage.
Unlike his executive counterpart in San Francisco, who is breaking his oath of office, Mr. Bush is appealing to the rule of law and allowing the people of the United States to have a say.
If a majority wants to make marriage gender-neutral, then Mr. Bush will be voted out. Representatives in Congress and the state legislatures can vote down the amendment, and the issue will be settled.
If a majority wants to keep marriage as it has been throughout the ages, Mr. Bush will be re-elected. The members of Congress and the legislatures should follow the will of the majorities of their constituencies and the amendment should pass.
Why is this editorial page against the grand workings of democracy all of a sudden? Judges and maverick executives are making their own law in the land. It is about time to get the legislative branch to do its job!
