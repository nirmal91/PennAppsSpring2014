In another sign of the slackening demand in the once-hot category of flavored malt beverages, the Miller Brewing Company is ending ventures with Allied Domecq and the Brown-Forman Spirits division of Brown-Forman under which Miller produced and sold three ''malternative'' brands.
Scott Bussen, a spokesman in Milwaukee for Miller, part of SABMiller, confirmed a report of the decision this week in Advertising Age.
Stolichnaya Citrona and Sauza Diablo, which Miller marketed on behalf of Allied Domecq in London, are being discontinued, Mr. Bussen said, while Brown-Forman in Louisville, Ky., will take over production and sales of Jack Daniel's Original Hard Cola.
One flavored malt beverage, Skyy Blue, produced with Skyy Spirits in San Francisco, part of Campari, will continue to be marketed, Mr. Bussen said. A new version of the drink, Skyy Sport, with fewer carbohydrates, will be introduced next month.
Malternatives were popular when they began appearing in 2002 but fell prey to the fickleness of the target audience, drinkers age 21 to 25, as well as complaints from consumer activists that they skirted limits on marketing by using liquor brand names on products classified as similar to beer.
