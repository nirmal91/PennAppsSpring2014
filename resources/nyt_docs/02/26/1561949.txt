Nine members of an elite police unit accused of abducting and murdering the former Yugoslav president, Ivan Stambolic, in 2000 went on trial in Belgrade. Prosecutors say the men were ordered to carry out the execution by Slobodan Milosevic, the president at the time of the murder. Mr. Milosevic was indicted along with the nine others but is not being tried in Belgrade because he is before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
