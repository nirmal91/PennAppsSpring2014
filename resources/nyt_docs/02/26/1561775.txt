Pewter -- the silver-gray alloy of tin that was used in ancient China, Renaissance Italy and Colonial America -- has come back, thanks in part to sword-and-sorcerer movies like ''Lord of the Rings.'' David Reiss, formerly the head buyer for Zona in SoHo, designs and distributes Italian pewter like bowls and flatware through his New Jersey company, Match. Above is Harry's Goblet, inspired by the Harry Potter movies; the next one, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' is out in June.
The goblet, partially plated with 24-karat gold, is 4 1/3 inches tall; $85 from Match, (201) 792-9444. Also at Gearys of Beverly Hills, 351 North Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif.; and Barneys New York, www.barneys.com.
