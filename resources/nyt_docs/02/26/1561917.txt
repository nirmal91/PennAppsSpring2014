To the Editor:
Kenneth L. Woodward's perceptive take on the Mel Gibson film (''Do You Recognize This Jesus?,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 25) does not mention the one ''Christian basic'' behind the fact that the crosses in many Protestant churches are empty of a body: faith in resurrection, which turns the cross from an instrument of torture into a sign of victory over sin and death. Without that faith, early Christianity would hardly have survived the death of Jesus.
