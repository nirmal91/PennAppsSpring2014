An article on Feb. 10 about increasingly friendly relations between Russians and Japanese in Japan's northern port of Wakkanai referred incorrectly to participants in maritime rescue exercises held in the Sea of Japan on Feb. 9, which coincided with the 100th anniversary of Japan's attack on Russia's Pacific fleet. They included only naval vessels from Russia and South Korea, not from Japan.
