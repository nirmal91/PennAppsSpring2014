The TV Sports column on Friday, about the use of numbers to describe the racecars in the telecast of the Daytona 500, referred incorrectly to Greg Biffle, a Nascar driver, and his finish in the race on Feb. 15. Biffle is a second-year driver in the top Nascar series, not a rookie. He finished 12th in the Daytona 500, not 3rd.
