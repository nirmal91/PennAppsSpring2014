To the Editor:
As a psychiatrist, I wish to state my profound concern about the mental anguish and suffering that Mel Gibson's movie ''The Passion of the Christ'' is likely to cause not only to the young and impressionable but to anyone seeing it (''Tears and Gasps for ''Passion,' '' news article, Feb. 24).
Mr. Gibson's searing and prolonged depiction of sadistic violence is wrenching and traumatic. His meticulous and obsessive portrayal of torture, mutilation, bleeding and physical pain is a lurid, cruel and pornographic assault on the feelings and senses of the viewer.
The intensity and repetitiveness of this sordid and painful imagery are as traumatic to witness as watching the hijacked planes crash into the World Trade Center again and again.
In my opinion, this movie is not only blatantly anti-Semitic but is also anti-Catholic, anti-Christian and demeaning to the true meaning and message of kindness, love and compassion that are the real teachings of both Judaism and Christianity.
