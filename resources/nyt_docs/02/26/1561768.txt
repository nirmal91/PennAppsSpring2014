When the costume designer Greg LaVoi posed his Barbie and Ken for a picture shoot at Zuma Beach, Calif., left, a passing surfer told him, ''You've got way too much time on your hands.'' But Mr. LaVoi, who received his first Barbie as a child in 1962 and credits her with inspiring his career, has taken Barbie and Ken all over the city, shooting them at Los Angeles landmarks, including the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and the old Pink's Hot Dogs. And note the attention to detail. Barbie and Ken at Zuma Beach wear their original Mattel outfits in front of a customized Mattel car and clutch surfboards made to scale by Mike Geib, Mr. LaVoi's neighbor. ''Barbie Loves L.A.'' ($30, Angel City Press) has a foreword by the Hollywood costume designer Bob Mackie. And ''Barbie Loves New York'' is coming soon.
