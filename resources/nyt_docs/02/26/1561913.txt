To the Editor:
I had the privilege of viewing Mel Gibson's movie ''The Passion of the Christ'' (news article, Feb. 24) with my church community two days before the official opening. My personal motivation was to establish a deeper emotional connection to Christ's final hours, which represent a core element of my faith.
In this regard, my expectations were well surpassed. Mr. Gibson is hugely successful in conveying the magnitude of the persecution and brutality that were directed at Christ.
No right-thinking mind could miss one of the most important messages of this great sacrifice. Both during and after the most torturous and agonizing experience imaginable, Christ repeatedly asked the Father for the forgiveness of those who brought this evil upon him.
That is the message that must dominate our contemplation of this account. Until we as a people can learn to forgive past transgressions in our families, in our local communities, in our great country and in the world, particularly in the Middle East, there can be no peace in our lives on this earth.
