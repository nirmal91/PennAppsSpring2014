A former guard at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe who was charged with the theft of a painting there in January has admitted stealing a second O'Keeffe canvas, from the city's Museum of Fine Arts in December, the police said. The guard, William Crumpton, 45, was arrested in January after reporting a robbery at the O'Keeffe museum. The painting stolen in December, ''Special 21 (Palo Duro Canyon),'' has not been recovered.
