To the Editor:
President Bush's proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage (front page, Feb. 25) is the step of a courageous politician.
Too many of our elected officials are afraid of alienating voters on this issue. The president's stand is morally correct and right.
Gays can call their union by any other name. But no! They want it to be called marriage. Marriage is a contract, thousands of years old. It is meant to recognize the contract between a man and a woman.
Gays can have their legally recognized commitments and unions. But they must go by another name. The term ''marriage'' is taken by heterosexuals. Don't rewrite the dictionary, the Bible or ancient laws of mankind.
