In the comic German movie ''Goodbye, Lenin,'' Katrin Sass, right, plays an East German woman who goes into a coma just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She wakes up eight months later to an apartment lovingly recreated by her son to appear exactly as it was in the old days before he installed things like miniblinds. The movie, which opens tomorrow, was a sensation in Germany, spawning ''ostalgie,'' a cult of nostalgia for remnants of East Germany. Shown here, the mother's bedroom with its wallpaper, heavy curtains and old-fashioned Socialist goodies. The set for the apartment, in East Berlin, is now rented out for ostalgie parties; fax requests to: 011.49.30.670.44.223.
