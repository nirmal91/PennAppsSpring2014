The airline Lufthansa said it lost 980 million euros ($1.22 billion) last year, down from a profit of 717 million euros a year earlier. The airline, based in Cologne, Germany, said it earned a profit of 30 million euros when excluding one-time items, reversing a year-earlier operating loss of 154 million euros. The company had write-downs of 800 million euros last year, mostly related to its catering business, LSG Sky Chefs. Lufthansa said its results improved in the fourth quarter and it expected to post a profit this year.
