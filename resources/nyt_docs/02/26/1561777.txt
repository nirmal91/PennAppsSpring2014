When your partner starts with a pre-emptive bid, a basic principle applies: Bid with a fit, pass with a misfit.
On that basis East should have passed on the diagramed deal when his partner opened three clubs. He chose to respond three spades, partly because there was a chance of a spade fit and partly because he hoped to shut out an opposing heart contract. An obvious danger was that there was a total misfit, and the partnership could be in trouble. And, as will appear, there was a less obvious danger.
The deal was played in a recent rubber-bridge game in Boca Raton, Fla., and the South cards were held by Joe Leff. He could not be shut out, and his bid of four hearts ended the auction. With a silent partner, West would have led the club king, and the defense would have been easy. It became far more difficult when he selected the spade jack.
The declarer covered with dummy's king, and East won with the ace. He did the best he could by shifting to a trump, and South took his three top honors. The diamond king came next, and East correctly ducked. Another diamond was led to the 10 and jack, leaving East on lead in this tricky position:
East confidently led the diamond ace, expecting South to ruff. But Leff simply discarded a club, an elegant move, and the defense was helpless. If East had then led another diamond, the declarer would have won in dummy and led the spade 10, ruffing out East's queen and eventually disposing of his remaining club loser.
The winning defense was far from obvious. In the diagramed position, East had to lead one of his low spades. This would have permitted South to discard one club loser and win in the dummy, but there would have been no way to take 10 tricks.
So East's bid of three spades had induced his partner to lead that suit and made the defense exceptionally difficult.
