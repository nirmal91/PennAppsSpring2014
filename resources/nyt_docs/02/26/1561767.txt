When Gunta Stölzl applied to study architecture at the Bauhaus in Germany after World War I, Walter Gropius said that she and other women would have to study weaving instead. But ''architecture's loss was textile's gain,'' said the textile designer Christopher Farr. Ms. Stölzl became head of the Bauhaus weaving department and was the only woman on the faculty.
Now Mr. Farr is making a limited series of wool and mohair rugs patterned after her designs (top, ''Untitled 639,'' 11 feet by 8 feet, $15,400; above, ''Untitled 675,'' 10 feet square, $17,500). They are on display through March at Christopher Farr, 748 North La Cienega Boulevard; (310) 967-0064.
