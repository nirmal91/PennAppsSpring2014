Observing a time-honored practice of electronics makers, Eastman Kodak has introduced an improved version of its 14-megapixel digital camera, the DCS Pro SLR/n, priced around $5,000. But unlike countless digital camera buyers before them, owners of last year's model, the DCS Pro 14n, will not have to buy the new camera to benefit from advantages like a greater sensitivity in low light. Instead, Kodak is offering to upgrade the image sensor and software of the older model for about $1,500.
Madhav Mehra, Kodak's general manager for professional digital capture, said two design features made the upgrade possible. Their mechanical and electronic components are built around easily replaceable modules, and their software, rather than being permanently burned into microprocessor chips, is firmware that can be replaced by Kodak. The upgrade will be available starting March 15 at Kodak service centers.
The main change from last year's model involves the range of ISO settings, which are comparable to film speed ratings. That range, which had been ISO 80 to 400, has been expanded to ISO 6 to 1,600. The new camera also offers a few minor conveniences that are not available with the upgrade, like an external light-emitting diode that glows when images are being transferred to the camera's memory card.
Mr. Mehra predicted that upgrades would become common for more expensive consumer models. ''At $800 or more, those are not a replaceable item,'' he said.
