Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, will use campaign money to reimburse political donors and consultants who arranged a three-day retreat to the Bahamas this month attended by Mr. Perry, his wife and three aides, the governor's office said. The group, which included contributors and an advocate of school vouchers, flew on a private jet for a conference on school financing.
