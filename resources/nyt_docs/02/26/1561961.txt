State Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the United States Supreme Court to intervene in the case of Kevin Cooper, whose execution on Feb. 10 was halted by a federal appeals court. Mr. Lockyer is trying to block the appeals court from sending the case for a review of evidence that defense lawyers say will exonerate him in four killings in 1983. Mr. Lockyer's office wants more time to prepare its challenge.
