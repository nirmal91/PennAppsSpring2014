To the Editor:
''The Passion of the Christ,'' with its dripping blood and scenes of agony and violence (news article, Feb. 25), is what we Americans expect from Hollywood -- if we are to spend six bucks (I live in the country) and two hours of our very precious time.
This movie panders to the same feelings the Spanish get when watching a bullfight, or the Romans watching a match between lion and gladiator in the Colosseum -- the drama of life and death and free-flowing blood and guts commensurate with such acts. We humans love it!
Since crucifixion was commonplace in those days, I imagine that Mel Gibson's portrayal is a bit overdone. But that's our Hollywood.
