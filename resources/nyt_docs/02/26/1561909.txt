To the Editor:
Re ''Keeping Faith With His Base'' (news analysis, front page, Feb. 25):
While I understand the political calculus that would lead the anonymous House Republican leadership aide quoted to say that a gay marriage ban ''gets you . . . churchgoing Democrats,'' it is profoundly insulting on a more personal level.
As a ''churchgoing Democrat,'' I chafe at the implicit attempt of this person to associate me with supporters of this amendment.
From the perspective of my faith, I see this proposed amendment as a convergence between blatant hatred and half-considered theology. Please spare ''churchgoing Democrats'' from being tarred with this brush!
