Peter Kerr, the communications director for the New York City Department of Education, has resigned after six months in the job. Mr. Kerr, 47, cited a two-hour commute from his house in Connecticut, saying he wanted to work closer to home. He was appointed to the post shortly before the school year started. In an e-mail note to staff members, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said that Mr. Kerr's resignation would take effect March 31 and that his deputy, Eileen Murphy, would serve as acting communications director.
