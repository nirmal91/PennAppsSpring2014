To the Editor:
President Bush opposes gay marriage (front page, Feb. 25). John Kerry opposes gay marriage. I oppose gay marriage. The majority of Americans oppose gay marriage.
Gay marriage is wrong and will be destructive to our society. Most people can look at nature to figure this out.
Gay marriage would threaten the domestic tranquillity, general welfare and be an injustice to a large majority of ''we the people.''
Gays should have a right to civil unions, but not marriage.
