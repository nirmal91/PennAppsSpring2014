A picture caption on Saturday about Boot Camp Day for children at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in Manhattan misidentified the boy reacting with dismay as a Marine sergeant told him how many pull-ups he had to do. He was Taylor Applegate, 10, of Forked River, N.J., not Zachary Cantillon of Connecticut.
