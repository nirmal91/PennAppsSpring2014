To the Editor:
President Bush's support for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is a shrewd political move (front page, Feb. 25).
In one stroke, Mr. Bush has shored up his extreme right wing and unleashed a powerful culture war calculated to divide and dispirit his opponents.
And true to form, he once again abandons his states' rights principles and exploits the basest, most divisive elements of American culture at the expense of tolerance, compassion and a sense of national community.
This is a skillful and shameful harbinger of the nasty general election campaign that is to come.
