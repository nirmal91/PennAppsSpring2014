An analysis of felony cases by a government panel, the Alaska Judicial Council, found that Native Alaskans served longer prison terms than any other ethnic group. The council's executive director, Larry Cohn, said the study was fueled by concerns about a disproportionate involvement of minorities in the criminal justice system. Although Native Alaskans make up 14 percent of the state population, they are 30 percent of felony cases, Mr. Cohn said.
