Thailand's sole satellite communications company, Shin Satellite, reported its second year of lower profit and said that it planned to sell $90 million worth of new shares in a public offering to finance expansion and pay debts. The company, which is controlled by the family of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, said net profit last year fell 23 percent, to 1.08 billion baht ($27.5 million). The company plans to launch a new satellite that would enable it to expand its service to Australia and New Zealand.
