To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Ban in Constitution on Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 25):
The sanctity of marriage doesn't depend on keeping same-sex individuals from calling their union a marriage; the sanctity of marriage depends on what individuals put into it.
Why are we attacking the sanctity of our Constitution with an amendment that would prevent individuals who wish to commit to each other through marriage from doing so?
We need to remember that we have a separation of church and state and that ''marriage,'' as a right allowed to all under the Constitution, may be different from ''marriage'' as performed by a church.
