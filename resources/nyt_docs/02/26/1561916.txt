To the Editor:
Clyde Haberman (NYC column, Feb. 24) deems the historically inaccurate use of Latin in Mel Gibson's movie ''The Passion of the Christ'' to be ''a blunder.'' Yet there are reasons to consider it a conscious creative choice.
Just as Mr. Gibson's movement repudiates the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church's modernizing moment, his movie seems to embrace all that it left behind: not just the taproot of ancient prejudice and medieval violence, but also the touchstone of religious traditionalism.
Could it be accidental that the bloody, polarizing ''Passion'' and its attendant media circus, dividing Christians from Jews and conservatives from liberals, arrive on the very verge of a papal succession, a struggle for the destiny of Catholicism in the new century? Or is that another blunder by the clever Mr. Gibson?
