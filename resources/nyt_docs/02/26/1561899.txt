To the Editor:
Re ''Bush Backs Ban in Constitution on Gay Marriage'' (front page, Feb. 25):
My partner and I go through life loving, respecting and caring for each other, and we try to do the same with every other person whose path we come across. That is also our legacy to Anna, our daughter.
In the six years of our committed relationship, we have never been told by anybody that our love and commitment are different from that of heterosexual couples. Until this week.
Now I can't help but feeling worried, pained, upset and alarmed.
