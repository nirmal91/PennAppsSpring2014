Eddie Palmieri has spent 50 years perfecting the art of making his piano ring out over forceful dance orchestras, from the mambo era to the salsa era to the current time of refinements in the relationship between Afro-Cuban music and jazz. And the raw power of his playing, its cathartic, almost therapeutic quality, is part of his musical personality: he comes on like a force of nature.
But when he only has one other musician onstage with him, he can obliterate his companion. In a duet performance with the tenor saxophonist David Sanchez at Le Jazz au Bar on Tuesday night, Mr. Palmieri went thunderously overboard, for an hour of musical claustrophobia. His chords were almost always two handed, without opening up into single-note passages, and he kept the sustain pedal down for an extraordinarily long time, building clouds of sound and extra accents around a clave rhythm deep in the heart of the music. He thinned out the sound only for a few short stretches to expose a leaner montuno figure.
Mr. Sanchez did what he could: he followed Mr. Palmieri intently, shadowing every chord change and playing a great deal of fast notes to break through the barrage. Toward the end of the set, he built up some momentum, showing a keen sense of time through his improvisations, shifting around the stresses in his rhythms between weak and strong beats. But it was tough business.
Mr. Palmieri growled from the gut as he heaved the music out, all of it at about the same overpowering volume. He wasn't taking incoming calls.
