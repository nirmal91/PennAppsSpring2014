To the Editor:
With regard to Mel Gibson's movie (news article, Feb. 25), I don't attend or boycott a movie based on a rating, nor do I take someone's side on a matter based on hearsay. I look at both sides of the story and I make up my own mind, and if this is a film that opens people's eyes, then so be it. Remember ''Schindler's List''? I do!
