To the Editor:
Regarding a proposed amendment to the Constitution to ban gay marriage, you write that ''President Bush proposes to radically rewrite the Constitution'' (editorial, Feb. 25). Since when is adding an amendment radically rewriting the Constitution?
And what is ''mean-spirited'' about reaffirming the definition of ''marriage,'' an institution that has formed an essential part of human society for centuries?
Once you tamper with the definition of ''marriage,'' any combination of members can constitute a marriage, and who is to say it can't? How exactly will one argue against this?
Also, if the definition of marriage changes according to society's fluctuating views, what is to keep society from redefining other words, like ''slavery'' or ''religion''?
Just because we all agree on what these words mean now doesn't mean that they cannot be redefined in the future to conform to one particular group's agenda.
It's not about gay rights but about tampering with established definitions in law.
