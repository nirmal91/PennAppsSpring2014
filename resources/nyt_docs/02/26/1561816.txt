Iran's top national security official said Wednesday that Iran was not required to proclaim its nuclear research programs, including advanced centrifuges, which it was accused of concealing by the International Atomic Energy Agency this week.
The Iranian official, Hassan Rowhani, head of the Supreme National Security Council, had agreed in a meeting with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain last October to allow thorough inspections and full disclosure of Iran's nuclear sites, but he said there were certain aspects of the Iranian research program that it was not required to report.
The nuclear agency, a branch of the United Nations, said Tuesday that Iran had failed to report that it had designs for a sophisticated centrifuge for enriching uranium.
A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Hamid Reza Assefi, called the episode a misunderstanding.
''What was published in the agency's report was about an unfinished work 13 years ago on polonium,'' he said. ''It is just a misunderstanding and it will soon be resolved.''
