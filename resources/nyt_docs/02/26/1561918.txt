The brewer Heineken reported that 2003 profit was unchanged at 798 million euros ($997 million) and warned investors that a weak dollar was likely to hurt results this year. Sales, however, were up 9.7 percent, to 9.3 billion euros from 8.4 billion euros in 2002. Sales in the United States were up only 2.2 percent from 2002, in large part because of the weak dollar, an uncertain economic climate, the war in Iraq and a temperate summer in the Northeast. Heineken said it did manage, however, to gain some market share in the United States.
