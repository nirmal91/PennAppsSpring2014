A federal judge allowed prosecutors to dismiss charges of capital murder against a man whom they had accused of killing two hikers in 1996 in Shenandoah National Park. In papers filed this month, prosecutors said DNA evidence found at the scene matched neither the victims nor the defendant, Darrell Rice. The judge, Norman K. Moon, denied a request from defense lawyers to bar further charges against Mr. Rice.
