Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gently stepped up the pressure yesterday on Gov. George E. Pataki to repeal the sales tax on clothing priced at less than $110. Without mentioning the governor by name, the mayor used his weekly taped radio address on WINS-AM yesterday to urge the state to repeal the tax on schedule this June, calling it ''a promise we made to the people of New York.'' Mr. Pataki called for extending the tax in his budget.
