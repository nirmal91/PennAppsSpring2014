To the Editor:
As an academic, I should have known better, of course. The e-mail message was from somebody I knew. The up-to-date virus definitions on my leading anti-virus program assured me that the file was clean. I double-clicked, and MyDoom (front page, Feb. 5) was unsealed. Computer geeks: you are right to blame the victim, and I apologize.
