To the Editor:
Thanks for ''Geeks Put the Unsavvy on Alert: Learn or Log Off'' (front page, Feb. 5). I have been online for more than 12 years (first on local bulletin board systems, then the Internet), and I have never been infected with a virus. This is despite not having any virus protection software until a year ago, when I got a new laptop that came with Norton installed.
For 11 years, I protected myself from viruses by using my own good judgment. If I wasn't expecting an attachment, I didn't open it! It's that easy.
Perhaps the computer industry could form a coalition to run public service announcements educating people not to open unexpected attachments. We could add ''Don't click'' to ''Smoking kills'' and ''Buckle up'' and so on. The costs would certainly be less than the disruption to business and communications these viruses cause.
