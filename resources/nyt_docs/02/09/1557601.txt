To the Editor:
Re ''Geeks Put the Unsavvy on Alert: Learn or Log Off'' (front page, Feb. 5):
I have little patience for the hostility of ''computer geeks'' for the less savvy. My job requires me to be on a computer all day, but doesn't provide time to solve its problems.
My computer is like my car -- I use it often, can tell when something's wrong, take it for a tune-up, but haven't time to learn its intricacies. That's why there are mechanics.
Working at a college, I am inundated with e-mail from people often sending necessary attachments. I can understand how a person could open what looks like a legitimate piece of expected business, and wham, there you are.
If I gave my ''customers'' the kind of patronizing tone this article describes, I would be out of work quickly. And if my friends took advantage of me, I'd learn to say no.
