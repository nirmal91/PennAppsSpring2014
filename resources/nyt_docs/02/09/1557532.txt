Swiss voters approved a measure on Sunday that would require the country to put into effect some of Europe's harshest laws on violent criminals and pedophiles.
The proposals won 56 percent of the national vote and support from 24 of Switzerland's 26 cantons, the ''double majority'' needed to make the proposals binding.
The vote, in a national ballot initiated by a mother whose daughter was abducted, raped, strangled and left for dead eight years ago, was a setback for the Swiss government. It had opposed the proposals but will now be forced to change the law.
Under the proposals, ''extremely violent and dangerous criminals who cannot be treated successfully with therapy'' must be locked away for life, regardless of age or health, unless scientific findings show they have been cured or are no longer dangerous.
The force behind the vote was Doris Vetsch, 45 -- whose daughter Katya, now 21, is still haunted by the attack on her -- and by Ms. Vetsch's sister, Anita Chaaban, 44. The two founded a support group, Light of Hope, in 1998 after meeting other families whose children had been attacked or killed by pedophiles.
Legal experts say Switzerland would be in violation of the European Human Rights Convention if the proposals are strictly interpreted and the criminals covered by their proposals are not granted regular judicial review of their cases.
