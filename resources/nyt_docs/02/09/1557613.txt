Bank of America, Charlotte, N.C., accepted the resignation of Carol H. Williams Advertising, Oakland, Calif., which had handled the bank's advertising aimed at black consumers since last February. Williams cited ''philosophical differences'' in resigning the assignment, which has billings estimated at $25 million to $30 million. The assignment is expected to be shifted to an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies; most of the Bank of America's account was consolidated at Interpublic agencies in 2002.
