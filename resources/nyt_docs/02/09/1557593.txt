To the Editor:
In ''21st-Century Japan, More Contented Than Driven'' (Letter From Asia, news article, Feb. 4), you indicate that many Japanese are not as driven as Americans and that they are comfortable with not being No. 1. But the success of Toyota, as it passes Chrysler and Ford and moves into second place in worldwide car production, suggests that Japanese executives are highly motivated. Does anyone doubt that Toyota executives are not focused firmly on overtaking General Motors for the top slot?
The Japanese companies that my law firm represents in the Midwest are not so interested in glitzy marketing and self-promotion. But they relentlessly pursue product improvement and continuing business innovation. The Japanese might not speak of being No. 1, but if their products have the best quality, best service and best prices, then they quickly become No. 1.
