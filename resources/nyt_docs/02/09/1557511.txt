Bitterness is oh so sweet at Joe's Pub, where the mordant pleasure that is Jackie Hoffman is spreading joy through anger in her one-woman show ''The Kvetching Continues.''
And kvetch she does for slightly more than an hour of comedy and song that vent her considerable spleen all over herself, life in the theater (where she is an adornment of ''Hairspray''), little children, breast feeders, gays, Jews, her mother, the aged, foreigners, benefit shows and theatergoers from places like Montana.
The list is not complete. Add Rosie O'Donnell, Eartha Kitt, Mary Tyler Moore and the Neil Simon Theater (home of ''Hairspray''). The effect is bracing. Well-merited guffaws, applause, cheers and whistles greet Ms. Hoffman's efforts, aimed at an audience familiar with theater and unafflicted with political correctness.
Ms. Hoffman grew up dreaming of a life in Broadway musicals, and, she says, ''by the time I was 9 years old, I was a gay man.'' In fact she is one refreshingly talented and funny woman. Question: What's wrong with her show? Answer: It plays only on Monday nights (at 7:30 tonight, March 8 and March 29 and at 9:30 p.m. on March 1 and March 15 at 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, in the East Village).
Directed by Michael Schiralli and skillfully accompanied at the piano by Dave Brunetti, Ms. Hoffman not only skewers her targets but also sends them up in the lyrics she has written for songs with titles like ''Eurotrash.''
She takes the blues out of blue Mondays.
