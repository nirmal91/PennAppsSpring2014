A New York City traffic enforcement agent was arrested yesterday on charges of slashing the tires of a neighbor's car. The car's owner said she and her boyfriend had seen the agent, Johanne Doliscar, 24, and her sister, Guardaline Doliscar, 26, slashing the tires on her Toyota Camry on Friday in St. Albans, Queens. Both sisters were arrested on charges of criminal mischief, and Johanne Doliscar was suspended from duty, the police said. The car's owner, Yolanda Auguste, 23, said she encountered her boyfriend's former girlfriend on Friday and the police were called to calm a dispute that followed. Later, Ms. Auguste said, she saw two women, both strangers, slashing her tires. She called to her boyfriend, Delepheche Pierre, 25, who recognized the women as cousins of his ex-girlfriend, she said.
