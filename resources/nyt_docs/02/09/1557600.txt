With news last week that the former General Electric chairman, John F. Welch Jr., had signed another book deal, it's time to look at what types of business books have been selling well.
After his autobiographical ''Jack: Straight From the Gut'' was published in September 2001, it was on The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list for six months. This time, Mr. Welch plans a how-to book, ''Winning,'' which will offer management advice and will be written with his fianc√©e, Suzy Wetlaufer. They became romantically involved while she was editor of The Harvard Business Review.
How-to business books can have considerable staying power, if the best-seller data of Nielsen BookScan are an indication. Of the 10 best-selling business books in 2003, as tracked by BookScan, only one, ''Fast Food Nation,'' was not an advice book. And all but one was a book that had been on the market longer than a year -- much longer, in the case of ''The One-Minute Manager,'' first published 22 years ago.
