To the Editor:
As a computer consultant who has been barraged with calls and e-mail messages about the MyDoom virus, ''Geeks Put the Unsavvy on Alert: Learn or Log Off'' (front page, Feb. 5) was of particular interest. Periodically, users will forward to me an e-mail message that includes questionable instructions (for example: run the attached file; it is an important update to protect your computer).
The attachment is, of course, some sort of Trojan horse or other kind of virus.
A few users would instead print the instructions and then send me a fax. I used to laugh at those folks. Now I'm starting to think that they are the smart ones.
