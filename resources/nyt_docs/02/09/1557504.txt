To the Editor:
Re ''Glamorous Glass Gives 10 Columbus Circle a Look of Crystallized Noir,'' by Herbert Muschamp (An Appraisal, Feb. 4):
I fear that the high praise given to the ''giant cluster of glass crystals'' at the new Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle will lead to even more such use of dazzling materials for future buildings in New York City.
But aren't architects aware of the blinding aspect of these walls when the sun's rays strike them? Try looking at those Columbus Circle towers at sunset or in the early morning.
It's impossible!
The blaze created when glass materials are used at the World Trade Center site may remind people of Sept. 11. Is this what we want?
Bring back the soft beige stone that absorbs the strong sunlight and avoids making every tall building seem not in your face but in your eye.
