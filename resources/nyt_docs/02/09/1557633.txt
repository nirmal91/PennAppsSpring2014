An article in The Arts on Jan. 19 about the problems that have confronted two filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, since their success with ''The Blair Witch Project'' five years ago misstated the title of a movie they were later asked to make but did not. It was ''Freddy vs. Jason.'' (There is no movie named ''Halloween 7.'' The seventh film in the series, ''Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later,'' was released before ''The Blair Witch'' project.)
