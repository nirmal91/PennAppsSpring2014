The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is joining efforts to discourage illegal file sharing, with an extensive public education campaign intended to explain the value of paying for music to the younger consumers most likely to share files.
The campaign, carrying the theme ''There's more to music than meets the ear,'' was created by agencies owned by Daniel J. Edelman Inc. including Blue, for advertising; Edelman Public Relations Worldwide; and Edelman Interactive Services, which developed a Web site at the center of the campaign. The site (whatsthedownload.com) began operating yesterday in connection with the 46th annual Grammy Awards, sponsored by the academy; a commercial intended to encourage visits to the site was shown during the CBS broadcast of the awards show.
''We're trying to change the behavior of young people who have grown up with technology,'' said Neil Portnow, president of the academy in Santa Monica, Calif., ''and don't understand the fact this is stealing.''
After considering concepts centered on famous musicians describing how file sharing hurts them, Mr. Portnow said, the academy and the agencies decided a better approach would be to remind younger consumers that ''music is part of their lifestyles'' and demonstrate the consequences of ''when it stops.''
For instance, in the commercial shown during the Grammy awards, a computer user is seen sharing a song file while young dancers enjoy the same song at a club. When the file swapping is completed, the song suddenly stops playing at the club, leaving the dancers in silence.
