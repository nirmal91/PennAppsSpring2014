To the Editor:
A Feb. 5 letter suggests that e-mail postage would not stop spam and analogizes to junk mail, which we still get even though the senders must pay postage. Even if some marketers continued to send e-mail advertisements, the number would drop.
Simply put, only those advertisements expected to generate a response rate high enough to justify the cost would be sent. The Viagra and pornography advertisements and letters from Nigerian generals wanting my bank account information that fill my mailbox would probably not be effective any longer.
That is probably why I get about five pieces of postal junk mail and 100 pieces of junk e-mail each day in my unfiltered account.
