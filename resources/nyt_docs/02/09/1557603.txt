To the Editor:
The situation described in ''Geeks Put the Unsavvy on Alert: Learn or Log Off'' (front page, Feb. 5) is yet another ''tragedy of the commons.'' When provided a free, and valued property, humankind's response has all too often been the degradation and virtual consumption of that property.
Human nature in the form of greed, ignorance, indifference, rationalization or vile intent all too quickly results in a loss for all, whether from the sheep on the village green in old England, or from greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere.
That the Internet would fall victim to such forces should come as no surprise. A measured and proper response to such losses has generally become clear only after the fact. Let us hope that rational protections for this ''electronic commons'' will prevail rather than name-calling and dismissive behaviors, which will only accelerate the same tragic end.
