A 12-inch water main near Stuyvesant Town broke yesterday morning, disrupting street traffic and shutting off water for some residents of one block, officials said. The break at East 13th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, affected the north side of the street for that block, which is primarily residential, said Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Workers were expected to fix the break by midnight, he said. The break occurred at 6 a.m. and water was shut off at 6:45 a.m.
