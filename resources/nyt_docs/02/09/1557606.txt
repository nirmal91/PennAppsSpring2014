To the Editor:
If geeks are losing their patience (front page, Feb. 5), then imagine what the rest of us feel like. As an intermediate-level trained programmer, I get frequent calls for help from friends when they lose their Internet connection or a printer won't function.
I've been surprised to see how often the problem lies not in user ignorance, but with software producers and Internet service providers whose business plan involves scaring people away from using customer service and making it almost impossible to discontinue subscriptions.
As a lay person, I would suggest that if we really have gotten to the point where file attachments from known correspondents are universally suspect, then it's time for providers to take prompt action to help us. Failing that, many of us might just get mad enough to disconnect.
