Four days of fighting between rival warlords competing to control their local cut of the narcotics trade in northeastern Afghanistan has left seven people dead and eight wounded, officials said Sunday.
Fighting flared between the militias of the district chief and the police chief of an area called Argo, near the town of Faizabad, in the province of Badakshan, said Gen. Muhammad Daoud, the top military commander in northeastern Afghanistan. The two men had been at loggerheads for three months, and the clash was stopped only when a Defense Ministry delegation intervened, the general said.
The delegation, sent from the general's military headquarters in neighboring Kunduz, reported that seven people had died and eight had been wounded in the fighting, he said. The fighting was over and the two local leaders would be taken to Kunduz for questioning, he said by satellite telephone.
The deputy interior minister, Hilaluddin Hilal, said the argument was over who should control what is in effect a road tax imposed by local leaders on the illegal opium trade. Badakshan Province is one of the highest producing areas of opium in Afghanistan, and it provides a major route for smuggling drugs into neighboring Tajikistan and then on to Russia and Europe.
News of the clash came just as Afghanistan was preparing to hold a two-day international conference on combating narcotics.
The Afghan government has banned the cultivation of poppies and production of narcotics, but it has little power to enforce the ban. Afghanistan is the source of about 90 percent of the heroin on the streets of Europe.
