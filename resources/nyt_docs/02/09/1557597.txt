To the Editor:
Jeffrey Rosen (Op-Ed, Feb. 6) lauds the new Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening system, called Capps 2, as a ''model'' for compromise between privacy rights and security needs.
Excuse me for my ''knee-jerk condemnations,'' but my hair stands on end at the idea that the screened information ''may include information about passengers' magazine subscriptions and buying patterns.'' Since when is a citizen's choice of reading material or consumer products a legitimate basis for government suspicion of criminal activity?
Will the Capps 2 program also screen for people who have recently exercised their right of free assembly in protest against administration policies? Will passengers' speech be used to assign them an appropriate threat index score?
Will the fact of this letter's availability on Lexis-Nexis make me subject to search and interrogation the next time I check in for a flight?
