The American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York has selected its new officers.
Although the nominees are subject to a vote by the membership, by tradition there are no competing candidates. Ron Berger, chief executive and chief creative director at Euro RSCG Worldwide New York, formerly called Euro RSCG MVBMS Partners, was nominated to serve a two-year term as chairman. Mr. Berger has served as vice chairman of the association, known as the Four A's, since April 2003; his agency is part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas.
Mr. Berger would succeed Ken Kaess, the chairman since April 2002. Mr. Kaess is president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.
Victor Ornelas, president and chief executive at Ornelas &amp; Associates in Dallas, was nominated to serve a second one-year term as secretary-treasurer, through 2005; he was elected last April to those posts for 2003-2004.
Members will vote on the officers during the annual meeting of the association, to be held in New York on March 31. It will be the first time the annual meeting will be held separately from the Four A's annual management conference, which is scheduled for April 14-16 in Miami.
