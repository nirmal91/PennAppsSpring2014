Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and the city's Office of Management and Budget are expected to announce this week the creation of a Hudson Yards Development Corporation to oversee the redevelopment of the far West Side of Manhattan, according to state and city officials.
The city will also announce the hiring of three investment banks as financial advisers and underwriters for the West Side project, the officials said. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration has drawn up plans for the transformation of the West Side over the next 30 years, with a stadium, hotels and new zoning to promote the development of 28 million square feet of office space and about 15,000 apartments.
But according to the officials, the announcement, which could come as early as Wednesday, will deal with only one of three elements of the city's financing plan for the West Side: financing for a $2.5 billion plan to extend the No. 7 subway line west along 42nd Street and south on 11th Avenue to 34th Street; building a deck over the eastern rail yard between 10th and 11th Avenues; and condemnation of land in the area and the creation of public parks.
That part of the project would be financed through the sale of development rights and zoning bonuses, which allow a developer to build a structure larger than normally permitted, as well as payments in lieu of taxes from developers who commit to the West Side.
