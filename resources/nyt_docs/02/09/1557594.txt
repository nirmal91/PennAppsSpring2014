To the Editor:
Hurrah for the Japanese! They are discovering what Europeans (especially the French) did long ago, that the quality of life trumps the quantity of yen or euros or dollars they may earn in exchange for working around the clock (Letter From Asia, Feb. 4). They place a higher value on family and friends than on material goods, all the better in this turbulent world.
Power for its own sake may bring happiness to politicians, but rarely to individuals.
