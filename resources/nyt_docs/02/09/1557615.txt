The M.L. Rogers Agency, New York, was opened by former senior managers of the New York office of Wolf Group Integrated Communications, which was closed. About 25 of the 40 employees of Wolf New York joined Rogers, working on former Wolf New York accounts like Aamco, Arbor Mist wine, Scotts lawn and garden care products and Wall Street Access, an online brokerage firm. Mike Rogers, executive creative director at Wolf New York, is president at Rogers, and David Bernstein, creative director at Wolf New York, takes the same post at Rogers.
A group of employees at Reese, Tomases &amp; Ellick, Wilmington, Del., led by Charles T. Housam, president, acquired the agency from Lynne Ellick, wife of the late owner Eugene Ellick, and renamed it RT&amp;E Integrated Communications. Financial terms were not disclosed.
