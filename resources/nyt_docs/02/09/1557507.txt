To the Editor:
How arrogant and patronizing are Mel Brooks's comments (Arts Briefing, Feb. 3). By expressing gratitude to Hitler as his inspiration for ''The Producers,'' Mr. Brooks goes far beyond his usual coarseness and compounds it by ridiculing the feelings of ''old Jews'' who may not get his point.
Mr. Brooks has the outrageous insensitivity to say, as you put it, that he's ''grateful to Hitler for letting him deride him and make some money, too.'' I'm sorry, Mr. Brooks; there are still some people out there who fail to get the humorous side of a barbarian.
