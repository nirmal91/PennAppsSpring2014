Fewer than half of New York's local water supply systems have had their emergency preparedness plans approved by the state, according to an Assembly report released yesterday. The report found that more than a year after the water systems were required by law to submit emergency plans to the state, only 46 percent of the plans have been given final approval by the Department of Health. ''Time is up,'' Assemblymen Jeffrey Klein, Richard N. Gottfried and Thomas P. Di Napoli wrote in the report. ''Finish the plans.''
