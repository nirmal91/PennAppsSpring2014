William Herrick, author of 10 novels and a memoir, died on Jan. 31 at his home in Old Chatham, N.Y. He was 89.
The death was reported by Jonathan Goodman-Herrick, his son.
Mr. Herrick, who was among the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of American volunteers who fought Francisco Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War, drew on that experience to write ''Hermanos!,'' a novel published in 1969. Reviewing ''Hermanos!'' in The New York Times, John Leonard called the work ''brisk, sincere and moving.''
In the 1980's Mr. Herrick wrote an ambitious political trilogy of espionage and terrorism: ''Shadows and Wolves'' (1980), ''Love and Terror'' (1981) and ''Kill Memory'' (1984). He also wrote ''Jumping the Line,'' a memoir.
As well as Mr. Goodman-Herrick, of Brooklyn, Mr. Herrick is survived by his wife, Jeannette Herrick of Old Chatham; a daughter, Lisa Herrick of Washington; another son, Michael Herrick of Brooklyn; and four grandchildren.
