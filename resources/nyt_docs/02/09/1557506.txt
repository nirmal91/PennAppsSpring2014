To the Editor:
Re ''Partial Progress for the 9/11 Inquiry'' (editorial, Feb. 6):
True progress would include letting the public in on all of the facts before the 2004 election. The administration claims that to do so would be ''political.''
This is an obvious ploy to hide the truth from the voting public. To conceal what went on before 9/11 until after the election is what is political.
