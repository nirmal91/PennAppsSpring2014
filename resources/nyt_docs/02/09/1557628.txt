Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Warren Zimmermann, the last United States ambassador to Yugoslavia, misstated the number of books he wrote on diplomacy. It was two, not three. ''First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power'' (2002) was his second. (The first was ''Origins of a Catastrophe: Yugoslavia and Its Destroyers.'')
