A livery cab driver was shot and seriously wounded early yesterday in Queens, the police said.
The driver, Michael Goldberg, 44, was shot in the stomach shortly after 2:30 a.m. after picking up a fare near 253rd Street and 147th Drive in the Rosedale area, a taxi dispatcher said. Mr. Goldberg was in stable condition last night at Mary Immaculate Hospital, said Debbie Cohen, a hospital spokeswoman.
The shooting occurred just two days after city and industry officials announced a significant decline in killings of the drivers, who often work in the city's most violent neighborhoods. The motive remained unclear, the police said.
Mr. Goldberg was shot shortly after meeting a customer who had argued with him on the phone about the price of the trip, said Martin Sejarto, the dispatcher on duty at the time at Mr. Goldberg's employer, Queens Village Car Service on Springfield Boulevard. Mr. Goldberg called the dispatcher to ask for directions to the Rosedale address sometime after 1:30 a.m., Mr. Sejarto said.
Soon, Mr. Sejarto said, Mr. Goldberg called again and said, ''I got shot.''
Mr. Goldberg's car was equipped with a bulletproof partition but no surveillance camera, said Fernando A. Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. Since 2000, all livery drivers have been required to have either a partition or a camera in their cars.
Mr. Goldberg, a Sikh who is married with one child, was born in India, Mr. Sejarto said, adding that he adopted a Jewish name when he moved to New York City. He has worked for the car service since Dec. 20, Mr. Sejarto said. ''This guy was the most honorable, kindest, gentlest -- absolutely honest,'' he added.
Crime scene tape fluttered from trees and signs by the shooting spot yesterday afternoon. Several residents said they had heard nothing.
On Friday, the city announced its first 12-month period in three decades without a single killing of a livery driver.
