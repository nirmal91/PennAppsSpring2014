To the Editor:
Re ''The Fat of the Land'' (editorial, Feb. 2):
To fight obesity, the Department of Health and Human Services supports the strongest possible resolution on diet, nutrition and physical activity at the World Health Organization General Assembly in May; that recommendation should be based on the best scientific evidence that can be adopted by the most number of countries.
The department has called on all those with a stake in the issue to do their part.
This means that individuals and families need to be more active and make healthier choices; it means that food companies need to provide and promote healthier choices for customers and include better information about their products.
And the government needs to make sure that the public has accurate, scientific-based information; we need our scientists to help us better understand the causes of and contributing factors to overweight and obesity.
We are making progress on all these fronts.
