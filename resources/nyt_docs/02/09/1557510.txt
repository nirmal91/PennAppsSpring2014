In the debate over America's prewar intelligence failures in Iraq, there are two important questions. First, is there someone the president could fairly blame? And second, does the president have the power to repair whatever problems exist?
In both cases the answer is no. No single government official had the authority to prevent the misjudgments about Iraq's weapons programs. And under the present rules no single official has the authority to set things right.
These problems grow out of a flaw in the National Security Act of 1947, which created the office of director of central intelligence. That law charged the director with coordinating our national intelligence apparatus, which is now a $30-billion-a-year enterprise with 15 semi-autonomous agencies. The law, though, gave the director no real authority to manage many of these disparate entities. In effect, America's spy agencies have been without a chief executive for the last 50 years. Short of the president, there is no one officer in charge.
Consider this: the defense secretary controls 80 percent of the money allocated to national intelligence and manages 7 of the 15 departments and agencies involved in intelligence. By comparison, the intelligence director controls only the Central Intelligence Agency, signs National Intelligence Estimates (the classifed documents that reflect the consensus of intelligence agencies) and advises the president.
Giving the Defense Department control of so much of America's intelligence network may have made sense during the cold war. After all, the primary threat to the United States was a military one, and intelligence on the military capacity of our foes was essential to national security. But now our primary threat comes from terrorism, and the military is only one line of defense against this danger. Our intelligence efforts must be redirected to reflect these realities. This means finally giving the intelligence director greater authority.
How do we do this? Here are five suggestions:
* Before 9/11, a commission led by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to the first President Bush, suggested that responsibility for the National Security Agency (electronic spying), the National Reconnaissance Office (photographic spying) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (photographic interpretation) be transferred from the defense secretary to the intelligence director. Because the director already controls most of the country's human intelligence activities, this would place all of America's principal spying organizations under one manager. Pentagon concerns about loss of control could be allayed by giving the defense secretary a ''presidential trump card,'' meaning that only the president could overrule a personal request by the secretary of defense for a particular spying mission (redirecting a satellite, for example).
* The director of intelligence should be given the authority to supervise the distribution of all intelligence data, both raw and evaluated. Today individual spy agencies create ''compartments'' for highly sensitive information; they control access to these compartments in order to protect against leaks that might compromise the safety of agents and other sources of intelligence. This privilege is often abused -- sometimes for purely bureaucratic advantage. It helps explain, for example, why the C.I.A. and Federal Bureau of Investigation had difficulty exchanging data about suspected terrorists in the months before 9/11. It is the intelligence director, with the national interest in mind, who should decide who sees what -- and when.
* The intelligence director should have the authority to oversee the budgets for all 15 intelligence agencies. Only with a single hand in control can we hope to have a budget that has a unifying theme and covers as many intelligence needs as possible. The defense secretary and others could, of course, submit their dissents alongside the director's proposed budget.
* Control of the new Terrorism Threat Integration Center, which the intelligence director now heads, should be transferred to the secretary of homeland security, giving him responsibility for integrating domestic and foreign intelligence on terrorists. In the name of preserving civil liberties, we want to keep our foreign intelligence agencies out of the domestic arena as much as possible. When it comes to fighting terrorism, though, it is essential that someone be in a position to understand what is happening both here and abroad. It would also make sense, then, to transfer the F.B.I.'s domestic antiterrorism and intelligence operations to the Department of Homeland Security.
* Finally, the C.I.A. needs its own director. The two positions of director of central intelligence and head of the C.I.A. -- now by law vested in one person -- should be separated. For the person who manages the C.I.A. to also make decisions about other intelligence agencies creates the potential for favoritism and conflict of interest. In addition, this arrangement provides another level of supervision of the C.I.A. An intelligence director who is independent of that agency can monitor its performance more objectively than can one who is also its operating head. What's more, being both director of central intelligence and head of the C.I.A. is too big a job for one person -- particularly in the face of a terrorist threat of frightening proportions.
Separating the two jobs would require Congressional approval. But all the other suggested changes can be made by the president -- and they can be made now, without waiting months for the recommendations of intelligence commissions like the one President Bush appointed Friday. The reforms won't be easy to put in place, of course. The Pentagon, fearful of losing power, would probably object strongly. If, however, we want to improve the way our spy agencies are managed and fight terrorism more effectively, then we have no choice but to take these steps.
