To the Editor:
In ''How to Protect America, and Your Rights'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 6), Jeffrey Rosen deplores the ''politicizing of the war on terrorism,'' which prevents bipartisan ''moderate compromises'' on the Patriot Act.
The very notion of this amorphous war without foreseeable end, however, is itself a radical politicization widely accepted by the entire political establishment. It has been declared not against a state or even a concrete terrorist organization like Al Qaeda; Iraq is but one of its battles.
The war on terrorism is thus a permanent political tool, justifying pre-emptive action counter to accepted domestic and international norms. It has produced the equation between patriotism and surveillance embodied in the Patriot Act's very name.
