Nicholas Richard Doman, a New York lawyer who wrote about international law and politics, died on Jan. 25 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, his family said. He was 90 and also lived on Shelter Island.
Mr. Doman specialized in wills and estates and in pursuing the restitution of property seized in Europe, particularly in eastern Germany under the Nazi and Communist regimes. He retired from his firm, Nicholas R. Doman, two years ago, his family said.
Born in Budapest, he graduated from the London School of Economics in 1932 and received an M.A. degree from the University of Colorado in 1935. He got his doctor of laws degree at the University of Budapest in 1936 and did postgraduate work at the Geneva School of International Studies. A chair in international law at Colorado's law school is named after him.
In World War II he was a first lieutenant in the Army, attached to the Office of Strategic Services. He was then assigned to the legal staff of Robert H. Jackson, the United States' chief prosecutor at the main Nuremberg war crimes trial.
Mr. Doman's first wife, Katharine Huntington Bigelow Doman, died in 1991. He is survived by Judith Nicely Perrin Doman, whom he married in 1992; two sons, Daniel B., of Manhattan, and Dr. Alexander M., of Atlanta; a stepdaughter, Elisabeth Null, of Silver Spring, Md.; and six grandchildren.
