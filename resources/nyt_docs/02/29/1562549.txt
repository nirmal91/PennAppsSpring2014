To the Editor:
I was appalled by A. O. Scott's declaration that current on-screen performances mark the ''New Golden Age of Acting'' [Feb. 15]. There is some excellent work out there, to be sure, but it is work executed by a handful of actors.
Now more than ever, audiences are subjected to third-rate performances by talentless models or other vapid beauties who took a couple of coaching sessions. And talented actresses like Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron are seemingly nominated for Oscars only when they willingly choose to be made less attractive.
Another oddity is that actresses who play prostitutes seem to be especially Oscarworthy as well. These trends illustrate sad truths about our society and the standards we uphold for female talent. Mr. Scott touches upon these double standards when he writes ''Among women, from whom we continue to expect glamour as well as grit, the tradition is harder to trace.'' What would happen, I wonder, if average-looking actresses were given the opportunity to play these ''gritty'' roles that only beautiful-but-made-less-beautiful actresses get to play? For today's actress, there is a glorious range of roles, from prostitute to executive, that only the beautiful seem privy to. Golden, indeed.
