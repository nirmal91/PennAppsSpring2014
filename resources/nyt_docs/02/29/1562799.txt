Two of Hartford's most prominent 19th-century institutions, the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art and the Hartford Club, have agreed in principle to a purchase deal.
The museum's trustees on Feb. 19 unanimously approved the purchase of the Hartford Club's century-old clubhouse. The club's membership is expected to ratify the agreement March 10. No sale price was announced.
The sale will be beneficial to both institutions, according to officials of the museum and the club. The Hartford Club, whose membership has dropped from 1300 to 800 since 1998, will move to a new downtown site better suited for its current membership, and the museum will be able to expand to a building only 100 yards from its existing location on Prospect Street.
''In the long term, this annex will free up about 17,000 square feet in the current museum campus, most of which is being used as offices, non-art storage, our woodworking shop and catering facilities, but could be gallery space once more,'' said Willard Holmes, the Atheneum director.
It will also mean the Atheneum can remain open during a renovation and expansion for which it has raised more than $63 million. The museum's trustees dropped plans for an addition that would have cost $80 million and required the museum to close during construction.
The Hartford Club, which has been temporarily closed since Jan. 16 when a pipe burst, causing extensive water damage, had been looking at several downtown sites, said Alfred Bertoline, the club's president.
''The sale of the club is the next step in the implementation of a two-year strategic plan for the Hartford Club, the goal being to provide an improved facility for our members,'' Mr. Bertoline said.
The agreement permits the club to remain in its present clubhouse until June 2005. The club is expected to reopen in May.
