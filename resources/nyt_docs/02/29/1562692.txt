Nick Bollettieri, who is legendary for his coaching of Mr. Agassi, is designing a tennis program for the new Ritz-Carlton resort in Grand Cayman.
Mr. Bollettieri, 72, still keeps to a routine that would flatten most people half his age: he gets up at 4:30 a.m., then goes to the academy in Bradenton, Fla., that he founded in 1978 to train tennis players. (Under new ownership, it was expanded to train golf, basketball, baseball, hockey and soccer players.) He works out with a trainer for one hour, teaches tennis for five hours, works with his secretary for three hours and then spends an additional two to four hours observing players and coaching his top students. Evenings are reserved for writing articles.
Surprisingly, his favorite pastime is golf, which he called ''a great game.''
