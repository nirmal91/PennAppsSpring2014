RISING
BOSTON UNIVERSITY -- The Terriers (22-4, 16-1) have won 11 in a row and 22 of 23 to earn a share of their third consecutive America East regular-season title. They are led by forward Rashad Bell (11 points, 6.7 rebounds) and guard Chaz Carr (13.2 points), both juniors.
VALPARAISO -- Coach Scott Drew left for Baylor a week before classes began, and the Crusaders lost 9 of their first 13. Drew's father, Homer, who led the Crusaders to 6 N.C.A.A. bids in 14 seasons, has helped them recover. Valparaiso (14-12, 10-5 Mid-Continent), 7-3 in its last 10, can clinch the regular-season title Tuesday against Chicago State.
MISSISSIPPI STATE -- The No. 7 Bulldogs (23-2, 12-2 Southeastern) edged Vanderbilt last night, 72-69, to go to 11-0 on the road and 7-0 on the road in the conference.
FLORIDA -- The Gators (17-8, 8-6 S.E.C.) were ranked No. 1 in the country in early December. Then they struggled, and Christian Drejer, a 6-9 sophomore forward from Denmark (10.2 points, 4.8 rebounds), left school to play professionally in Europe. The Gators have recovered; they held off Arkansas, 73-68, last night to win their third straight.
FALLING
TEXAS TECH -- The Red Raiders (19-9, 7-7 Big 12) lost on the road again yesterday, 74-71 at No. 10 Texas. They are 3-7 in their last 10 and have lost their last six road games. That includes a 28-point loss at Nebraska, a 15-point loss at Oklahoma and a 19-point loss at Kansas. They scored 44 against Nebraska, their lowest point total since a 54-43 loss to S.M.U. in 1990.
MARQUETTE -- The Warriors (15-10, 6-8 Conference USA) lost at Alabama-Birmingham yesterday, 87-69, and are 4-6 in their last 10 games. Marquette reached the Final Four last season but is in danger of missing the tournament this season.
MARYLAND -- The Terrapins (14-11, 5-9 A.C.C) won the national championship two seasons ago. By losing to No. 11 Wake Forest yesterday, 91-83, they clinched their first losing season in the conference since 1992-93.
FLORIDA STATE -- With a soft nonconference schedule (Fairleigh Dickinson, Wagner, Nicholls State, Georgetown, Ky.), the Seminoles (17-9, 6-7) won their first 10 games and were 12-3 when they began their A.C.C. schedule. But they are 0-6 on the road in the conference.
