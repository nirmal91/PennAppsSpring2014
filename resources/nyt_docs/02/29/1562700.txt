To the Editor:
Re ''Preppy Punks'' (Feb. 22): Sam Stillman may survive the lifestyle he and his parents seem to embrace, but neither his parents nor any of the adults quoted in the article seem to understand the punk movement among young New Yorkers for what it really is: a mask for self-destructive behavior, depression and a sense of powerlessness that the adults in the lives of these teenagers refuse to help them confront.
Punk behavior includes activities about which parents seem blissfully unaware, including stealing, lying, fighting, self-mutilation and a rapacious appetite for drugs.
We're talking about 15-year-old kids who lived through 9-11. Do they have a right to be angry and scared about what's going on in the world? Of course. But if adults won't help them deal with their feelings in a safer, healthier way, nothing can save them from themselves and from the grave danger in which they place themselves.
