To the Editor:
Regarding the County Lines column ''On Marriage and Other Pressing Concerns,'' Feb. 1, by Debra West:
As far as Peekskill is concerned, the writer might want to take advantage of the walking tour of Victorian houses open during the ''Peekskill Days'' celebration in summer. The park at Riverfront Green and China Pier are open to the public at all times, and there are a number of quaint restaurants, a tea room and a new coffee shop. Besides the artists' shops, the Paramount Center for the Arts and free summer concerts at the Green, there is much more to Peekskill.
