While Americans recognize the debt that we owe to the men and women wounded in Iraq, Corbett's article went beyond that to describe the anger, isolation and depression that accompanies the physical wounds of war, as well as the awkwardness that so often permeates the experiences of wounded veterans returning to American life -- the stares, the fulsome praise from strangers or the people who quickly turn away to avoid eye contact. It may be difficult for those of us who are the beneficiaries of their valor to know how to respond to these wounded veterans.
