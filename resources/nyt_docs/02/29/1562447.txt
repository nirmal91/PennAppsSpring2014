To the Editor:
You were poorly served by the reviewer of the Library of America volume ''Ezra Pound: Poems and Translations'' (Feb. 1). Nothing was said about the faults of this new edition of Pound's work, which are considerable. The reviewer dwelt instead on what in his opinion were the faults of Ezra Pound. Pound had many faults, certainly, and he loved controversy, but he was, when the faults are numbered and the controversies forgotten, one of the greatest American poets ever, an opinion that is well supported by critics, scholars and other poets and writers who have for over a century done homage to Pound in thousands of ways. Without him, there would be no modernism in literature; with him, America led the way in innovations that made American poetry the vanguard of world literature.
The Library of America volume is the largest selection of Pound's work that has appeared so far, but it is not as comprehensive as it purports to be. Poems and translations are left out of it that some readers will miss; they will have to go to other Pound publications to find them. The introduction, chronology and notes are most helpful, but the impression that this volume contains all the poetry and translations of Pound except the ''Cantos'' is misleading.
