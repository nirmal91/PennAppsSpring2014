I do not want to discount the seriousness of the emotional disorders these soldiers are experiencing. Nevertheless, I found the descriptions of their treatments appalling. In many cases, the symptoms these young people were describing are well-known adverse effects of antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs, and yet this was not acknowledged in the article. These include insomnia, restlessness, agitation, irritability and emotional blunting.
