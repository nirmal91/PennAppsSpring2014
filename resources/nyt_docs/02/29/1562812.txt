To the Editor:
Re ''For Teenagers, a Course to Deal With Obstacles,'' (Jan. 4):
This article was thought provoking, however, it is critical to clarify that the Housatonic Youth Service Bureau sponsored the one-day defensive driving course, developed by the experts at the Skip Barber Racing School specifically for the teenage driver at a substantially reduced rate.
The Housatonic Youth Service Bureau is a nonprofit social service agency dedicated to providing a range of prevention and support services to the youth in northwest Connecticut. In addition, the Berkshire Taconic Foundation enabled the defensive driving program to be offered at relatively low cost to the students by awarding a sizeable grant to the youth service bureau for the last four years.
During this period of state reductions in prevention programs, it is imperative that your readers understand that valuable programs such as the one featured, happen only through extensive collaborative community effort and support. We are grateful to both the Skip Barber Racing School and the Berkshire Taconic Foundation for working with us to allow this extraordinary opportunity for young drivers to occur.
