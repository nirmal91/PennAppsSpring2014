To the Editor:
I disagree with Caryn James on her ''take'' on Dennis Miller and Bill Maher's shows [''They're Celebrities, and You're Not,'' Feb. 8]. Watching them is like being with friends, with some of whose opinions we may disagree, but whom we listen to with an open mind. These two guys have great personalities and killer humor to offer, and there's nothing pretentious about them as far as this viewer is concerned (my husband agrees). What a privilege it is to hear and see people like Rudy Giuliani and, yes, Al Sharpton, whose personalities we wouldn't have access to but for these shows.
Today, more than ever, the public is tired of lies, twisting of facts and self-aggrandizement put forth by our so-called leaders. All we want is the truth, whether it's good or bad. Let us make our own decisions on what makes sense to us.
