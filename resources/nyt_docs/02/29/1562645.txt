New York restaurants have not escaped the trend toward ever more casual attire. But if you feel inspired to dress up for dinner, you won't feel out of place at these restaurants.
ALAIN DUCASSEAT THE ESSEX HOUSE  **** [rating: four stars]
(212) 265-7300; 155 West 58th Street (near Seventh Avenue); $$$$; Review: 12/19/01.
Alain Ducasse promised a great restaurant and he has delivered it. His inspired, classically grounded French cuisine is served with the polish and grace befitting this intimate jewel box of a dining room.
CAFÉ DES ARTISTES  ** [rating: two stars]
(212) 877-3500; 1 West 67th Street (near Central Park West); $$$; Review: 9/24/03.
Take one step inside Café des Artistes and the tumultuous New York world outside disappears in a flash, replaced by lush floral displays, flattering lighting and Howard Chandler Christy's pastel murals. The continental menu includes classic dishes like Dover sole with brown butter and lemon; and pot-au-feu.
LA CARAVELLE  *** [rating: three stars]
(212) 586-4252; 33 West 55th Street (near Fifth Avenue); $$$$; Review: 9/18/02.
With its colorful murals, flattering lighting and dressed-up waiters boning ducks and filleting fish, La Caravelle's dining room is an oasis, or at least a welcome respite from the sweatsuits and tank tops that seem to dominate contemporary life. The chef, Troy Dupuy, has a delicate hand, especially with seafood.
CHANTERELLE  *** [rating: three stars]
(212) 966-6960; 2 Harrison Street (Hudson Street); $$$$; Review: 3/22/00.
Some restaurants win admiration; others inspire love. Chanterelle does both. Few restaurants are so welcoming or comfortable to enter. The strong suits of the chef, David Waltuck, are depth and intensity of flavor, and he doesn't shy away from thick, rich sauces in his quest to ravish the palate.
LE CIRQUE 2000  *** [rating: three stars]
(212) 303-7788; New York Palace Hotel, 455 Madison Avenue (50th Street); $$$$; Review: 5/9/01.
As pure spectacle, there is nothing in New York like Le Cirque. Diners go there to see and be seen. The menu moves back and forth between two poles: an almost rustic simplicity and sometimes heavy, lavishly presented fancy food.
DANIEL  **** [rating: four stars]
(212) 288-0033; 60 East 65th Street (near Madison Avenue); $$$; Review: 3/14/01.
Daniel is a top-flight French restaurant, sumptuous and grand, but still very much the personal expression of its chef and owner, Daniel Boulud. An inventive classicist, Mr. Boulud has both feet planted in the rich gastronomic soil of the Lyonnais region, but his influences come from all over the Mediterranean, and as far afield as Japan and India.
THE RIVER CAFÉ  ** [rating: two stars]
718) 522-5200; 1 Water Street (near Old Fulton Street), Brooklyn; $$$$; Review: 2/13/02.
With waterside seating, a spectacular view of Lower Manhattan, dim lighting, banks of flowers and live piano music, this may be New York's most romantic restaurant. The food is excellent and innovative.
