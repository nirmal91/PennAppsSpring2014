Migrant laborers living and working on the North Fork are the subject of a series of photographs that is part of an exhibition, ''Coming Up on the Season: Migrant Farmworkers in the Northeast.'' The show opened earlier this month at the Long Island Museum in Stony Brook and will run through May 16.
The show has previously been shown at museums in New Jersey and Massachusetts. This version includes photographs taken by Drew Harty last summer on the North Fork, once nicknamed ''Migrant Row,'' to emphasize the Long Island aspect of the history and culture of migrant workers. Other images in the exhibition look at migrant labor in Maine, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.
The exhibition, which is bilingual, also includes artifacts, historical photographs, interactive displays and videotaped interviews with laborers and growers.
The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday. Details are available at www.longislandmuseum.org.
