To the Editor:
As a 16-year-old punk and a student at Riverdale Country School, I found the article a mockery of everything my punk friends and I stand for. The portrayal of punk was almost completely aesthetically oriented.
Punk rock is about a state of mind and the way you live your life. It's about living by a code of ethics that involves striking back at what's wrong with society. If something is amiss, the brave will take action. They are today's punks.
