While I applaud the Army for establishing the support group at Fort Campbell, apparently a first of its kind, the Army must do more to help these young soldiers heal from the hell of war, not only physically but emotionally. As a private citizen, I would like to challenge wartime vets to come forward and to serve their country in a new way -- as mentors and friends to help these young men and women confront their pain and to get involved in helping them move into productive and meaningful lives.
The soldiers featured in your article have a lifetime ahead of them, full of opportunities to do great things. Alcohol and painkillers will not get them there; the love and support of human beings will.
