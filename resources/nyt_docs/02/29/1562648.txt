To the Editor:
Re ''Blunt and Influential, Kerry's Wife Is an X Factor'' (front page, Feb. 22):
I presume that John Kerry is grateful to have a strong, intelligent wife. Those of us who are fortunate enough to have married such a woman feel the same.
I did that 54 years ago and consider myself very lucky. She, with some help from me, raised six highly intelligent, strong daughters, along with two sons, all of whom are very successful and outspoken. I might add that we are never bored!
I hope that Teresa Heinz Kerry continues to call 'em as she sees 'em.
