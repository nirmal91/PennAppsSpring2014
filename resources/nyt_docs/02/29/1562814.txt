To the Editor:
Re ''Talk of a Gravel Pit Unravels Quiet Town,'' (Feb. 15), I would like to encourage the people of Lyme in their resistance to an unwanted gravel pit. We had a similar situation in the town of Sprague, but an outpouring of public participation, including Cub Scouts on a picket line, discouraged the would-be buyer. The townspeople, though among the least wealthy in Connecticut, then decided to buy the land and preserve it as open space.
The town has since declared a moratorium on subdevelopment and is rewriting its zoning regulations under an explicit philosophy of maintaining Sprague's rural character.
It was the threat of a gravel pit that awakened the town and may ultimately save it.
