A fashion designer and Spence School senior, Jessie Della Femina has always had a head for business. ''I started keeping a sketchbook in second grade -- I arranged the clothes in delivery groups,'' she said, using the industry term for store shipments. ''The drawing of a shirt would be messy, but it would have a price: $39.95.''
Ms. Della Femina, daughter of the adman and restaurateur Jerry Della Femina and the ''Full Frontal Fashion'' co-host Judy Licht, was discovered at a Henri Bendel open call for designers when she was 15 and has been in business ever since.
Her clothes, which are sold at Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Scoop in New York, are a sexy mix of bohemian and preppy, and not coincidentally her favorite designers are Tracy Feith, Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, along with Blumarine ''for the colors and freshness,'' she said. Here, she wears a Joy vs. Happiness sweater ($170), Arden B. jeans ($118) and Michael Kors fur boots ($490). Accessories include an Herm√®s bracelet ($430) and a Spence class ring, stacked with a wedding band from her mother's first marriage.
This fall, Ms. Della Femina, 18, plans to start juggling delivery groups with classes at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Work helps me keep a healthy perspective,'' she said. ''I don't get hysterical over a science test, because I know I do other things that are more meaningful to me.''
