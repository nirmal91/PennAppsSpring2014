The Streetscapes column on Jan. 25, about the architecture of the midblock buildings on 28th and 29th Streets visible from a parking lot running through the block between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, misstated the name of the landmark district that encompasses the south side of the property. It is the Madison Square North Historic District, not Midtown North. A reader alerted The Times last week about the error.
