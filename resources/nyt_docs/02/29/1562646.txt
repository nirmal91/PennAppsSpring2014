The premium wines of Carmel, Israel's giant 122-year-old winery, are undergoing a full-dress upgrading. The first example to reach America, a single-vineyard chardonnay, was fashioned to be food-friendly. A light, appley, quasi-Burgundian white called Tavor, it comes from grapes from Mount Tabor in lower Galilee.
McCabe's, 1347 Third Avenue (77th Street), asks $17, and limits a customer to two.
