To the Editor:
One-half of the American psyche wants the best health care and the other half doesn't want to pay for it.
More important than who should pay is, what are we paying for? My organization has determined that quality gaps -- failing to control blood pressure after a heart attack, for example -- lead to 57,000 avoidable deaths every year. Billions are wasted on unnecessary procedures because doctors feel compelled to practice defensive medicine.
Politicians of all stripes are promising Americans better insurance and fewer controls on care. Few talk about reining in costs by focusing on quality. Until we say ''no'' to the wrong kinds of care, we won't have the resources to say ''yes'' to the right kinds.
