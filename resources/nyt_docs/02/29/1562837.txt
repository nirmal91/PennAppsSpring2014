The Nassau County Legislature last week unanimously approved a law that will make permanent the fiscal reforms that were established by the oversight board imposed by the state in 2000 when the county teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.
The reforms that will now become mandatory for all future county administrations include the preparation of a four-year financial plan, quarterly budget reports and authorization for the county to reserve funds for future budget stabilization.
Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, said he proposed the law to help secure the county's financial future. ''We have worked very hard toward fiscal recovery,'' he said. ''This law will nsure that our hard work will not be undone.''
The state pledged a $105 million bailout and created the Nassau Interim Finance Authority in 2000, when the county was mired in deficits and carried a credit rating just one notch above junk status.
The state panel reviews and approves the county's budgets, allows the county to borrow money using the agency's stronger credit rating, and if necessary reserves the right to take over county finances.
But the county ended the last fiscal year with a $21.7 million surplus and was the only municipality in the country to receive two credit rating upgrades during the 2003 calendar year.
Ronald A. Stack, the finance authority chairman, applauded the new law but said that having it in place will not make the financial oversight board obsolete, because state law requires the agency stay in place for as long as any bonds issued for the county by the board are outstanding.
