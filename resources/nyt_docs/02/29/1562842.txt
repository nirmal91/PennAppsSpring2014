Does anybody seriously doubt the existence of racism and segregation on Long Island? The report by Acorn on housing discrimination [''Open Arms, Closed Doors and Racism,'' Feb. 22] might convince nonbelievers.
About 20 years ago my husband, toddler daughter and I moved to the Island. Renters at first, we quickly decided that buying a house was a financial priority. But we were ignorant of the region's layout and character and had no local relatives or friends for neighborhood guidance or advice. We scoured the classifieds and signed up with a few real estate agents. We had no idea what we were in for.
Some agents were subtle in their steering. But one of them came right out and said it.
''You'll like East Northport better than Greenlawn,'' she said, ''because it's all white there.''
We emphatically told her that we wanted a diverse neighborhood for our children to grow up in. So we moved to Greenlawn and lived there happily until last year, when our youngest flew the coop.
We should have reported that real estate agent but we didn't. For that I shall always feel regret.
Am I saddened that Acorn's results were so disheartening? Naturally. Surprised? Of course not.

Discrimination is not limited to the western part of Long Island. It is prevalent in East Hampton. In fact, it was part of William McGintee's successful campaign for town supervisor seat last year. In an August letter targeted to the Springs, where numerous Hispanics live, he vowed to ''take back the town'' so ''we'' don't have to move away. A woman who voted for him is already disappointed in him because, she said, ''he did not get rid of the Latinos as he promised.''
