To the Editor:
The plot in which a man is born old and gradually ''grows young'' is hardly novel. In his review of ''The Confessions of Max Tivoli,'' by Andrew Sean Greer (Feb. 8), Gary Krist seems to have forgotten F. Scott Fitzgerald's wonderful short story ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' (1922), in which the hero, born in 1860, is an old man of 70 who proceeds to grow young until he reaches the moment he begins life and disappears. Fitzgerald himself noted that the story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's that it was a pity the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end. Weeks after completing the story, Fitzgerald added, he discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's ''Notebooks.''
