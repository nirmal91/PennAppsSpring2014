To the Editor:
Re ''What Goes Around . . .'' (column, Feb. 26):
If Thomas L. Friedman, in touring a call center in Bangalore, India, had looked inside those American-brand computers and telephones, he would have probably found labels saying ''made in China'' (or the Philippines or Taiwan, name your preferred off-shore place).
Yes, many American companies are doing well, but only for the benefit of their highly paid executives and their larger stockholders; their success does not trickle down.
It will be interesting to watch this experiment in international trade and social reconstruction unfold to a not-so-outlandish predictable end: the point when a Bangalore call center or a Chinese slipper maker will discover that it can export jobs to America to take advantage of the misery salaries that a jobless and health-care-less population in the former rust belt and manufacturing belt and office high-rise belt will find itself glad to accept.
