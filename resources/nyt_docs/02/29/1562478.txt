Jon Gertner's article (Feb. 15) confirmed my sense of politics as marketing. In essence, voters are like consumers, and the retailing of ideas as opposed to consumer goods is not vastly different. Retail politics and traditional campaigning will remain the same, but the sophistication of data analysis creates a candidate's dream: calibrating the pitch to the most receptive ears.
The trend from fund-raising to building a movement makes technomarketing even more compelling. Getting a voter in the door with one issue sounds like retailing basics to me.
