To the Editor:
I do not share Thomas L. Friedman's optimism about exporting lower-skill jobs abroad (column, Feb. 26).
When I graduated from high school, I could get a job that allowed me to be self-supporting, and because I had this job, I could go to college (in fact, my employer paid for college).
Today, my nephew's son cannot do this. The only jobs available to him were in fast-food places (no college tuition there). After months of searching, he enlisted in the Army. He will be deployed next month.
Good show, Mr. Friedman. I am so glad that Indians drink water bottled by Coke and use Carrier air-conditioners.
