NAPOLEON
A Political Life.
By Steven Englund.
Lisa Drew/Scribner, $35.
The French remain passionately divided about both Napoleon's accomplishments and his crimes, according to Steven Englund in his lively biography ''Napoleon: A Political Life.'' Most recent scholars, he writes, ''fall over themselves'' to prove that Napoleon Bonaparte's rule amounted to nothing more than the most brutal of tyrannies, a tendency he attributes to a contemporary obsession with the ''Nazi-fascist model,'' typified by unambiguously vicious dictators like Hitler and Stalin. Englund seeks less to rehabilitate Napoleon's reputation and legacy than to provide readers with fuller view of the man and his actions. Although Napoleon is celebrated in French popular culture, in laudatory novels, songs and pageantry, official commemorations elide Napoleon -- no Paris metro stop, street or place has been named
for him, although a metro stop recalls Robespierre, who sent far more of his adversaries to the guillotine than Napoleon did. Only very recently has Englund observed any serious scholarly attempts at more complex and realistic portrayals that acknowledge Napoleon's accomplishments, like his insistence on freedom of religious practice and educational equality. Despite his sometimes boyish fascination, Englund, whose books include ''Grace of Monaco,'' also vividly details the violence of Napoleon's increasingly ambitious excesses.
