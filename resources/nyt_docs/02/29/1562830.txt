On Tuesday, Governor McGreevey introduced a $26.3 billion budget proposal for 2005 containing the largest increase in state spending in five years. New spending would include $125 million to revive the Division of Youth and Family Services, a $113 million increase for higher education and $205 million in direct aid to school districts.
The plan would lift a freeze on state aid to municipalities as part of a $48 million tax-relief package that includes $25 million in direct aid to be divided among New Jersey's 566 municipalities.
To offset the increased spending, the plan calls for the state to borrow $1.5 billion and to impose more than $1 billion in taxes and fees.
It raises cigarette taxes, already the nation's highest, by 45 cents a pack, puts a fee on cellphone towers and increases surcharges for traffic violations. It also adds ''environmental impact'' fees to be charged to manufacturers of petroleum products, a 1 percent tax on the purchase of homes valued over $1 million and a surcharge on new tire sales.
