FIVE MEN WHO BROKE MY HEART
A Memoir.
By Susan Shapiro.
Delacorte, $21.95.
Shortly before her 40th birthday, one of Susan Shapiro's former boyfriends, a scientist with whom she had a 15-year off-and-on affair, tracked her down to ask if she would help him promote his new book. Shapiro decided to use the experience as inspiration for a book of her own, and embarked on a six-month bender of revisiting old flames with a midlife-crisis fervor. The result is her bluntly titled ''Five Men Who Broke My Heart,'' a light, playful, quasi-autobiographical (Shapiro changes names, dates, and descriptions of some characters) history of her love life from her first date at the age of 13. Through dinner dates and e-mail messages she confronts her former boyfriends, who are categorized like Ken dolls (the mild-mannered professor, the rock-star-like older man, the handsome lawyer) and asks them why they were attracted to her, how they felt about the relationship and, of course, what went wrong. They don't offer much, and the bulk of the book relies on Shapiro's ruminations. Happily married but depressed about not having a book deal or a baby, a
''romantic extremist with no sense of irony,'' she recounts years of therapy sessions. Shapiro's sentimentality becomes grating, but the entertaining dating philosophies she culls from her overdramatic soul-searching offer a decent payoff. After telling the story of a vicious separation from a writer, for example, Shapiro rationalizes her penchant for sensationalist celebrity breakups: ''No matter how rich or talented or smart you were, sex gone wrong could turn your life into an ugly circus. It made me feel better knowing this transcended race, class and geography.''
