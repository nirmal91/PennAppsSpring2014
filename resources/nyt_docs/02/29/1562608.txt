Xocolatz, a tiny cafe with a big, Aztec-like name, began as a dessert shop two years ago just off the corner of North Avenue and Elm Street in Westfield.
''The name came to me while reading a book on chocolate,'' said Jaime Chaves, the owner and executive chef. ''At first we specialized in fabulous desserts, but folks kept asking for more.''
More turned out to be soups, salads, sandwiches and entrees accompanied by oven-baked bread sticks and Mr. Chaves's original potato chips.
Patrons entering the busy little Xocolatz (pronounced chock-oh-lahtz) know the drill. At the tiny counter, they peruse the menu, check out the daily specials and mentally devour a basket of chocolate fudge brownies, huge chocolate chip cookies and blueberry scones before placing their orders. Three recent menu items, all at $7.95, included a frittata with spinach, pepper, onion and cheese served over a bed of mixed greens with tomato, thinly sliced cabbage and cucumber, tossed in a low-fat tropical guava dressing; breaded eggplant topped with Black Forest ham, tomato and melted Mozzarella cheese and dressed with honey mustard on a rustic roll with farfalle pasta in a sun-dried tapenade; and tuna salad topped with Gruyere cheese, tomato and lettuce on a fresh baked croissant with a side of penne pasta and broccoli. Xocolatz's copper-topped tables for two can accommodate fewer than 20 hungry people, but the good news is that Mr. Chaves offers takeout and is available for catering all over the state.
