An article on Jan. 11 about the spread of AIDS through drug addicts' use of dirty needles misstated the number of people in New Jersey who have died of AIDS. (The error was repeated in a correction in this space on Feb. 1.) Since the start of the epidemic in the 1980's, according to the State Department of Health and Senior Services, 61,698 cases of H.I.V. and AIDS have been reported, and 30,951 of those infected have died.
