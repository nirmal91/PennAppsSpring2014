URBAN OUTFITTERS, so successful at peddling hipsterdom that it is practically the new Gap, may have hit a false note when it marketed a $28 T-shirt that said ''Voting is for old people.''
Russell Simmons, who runs a hip-hop empire and a voter education group, lashed out at the chain, and on MTV, a 21-year-old named Kat Storemski crossed out ''Old'' and wrote in ''All.''
Urban Outfitters defended itself with the explanation -- incorrect, it turns out -- that the shirt was a reprint of an old design ''meant to draw attention to the growing rift between politicians and their platforms and the concerns of young people in this country.''
John Foster-Keddie, a 25-year-old Yale graduate who designed the shirt for his clothing company, Vintage Vantage, said if anything, it was meant to poke fun at young people's apathy. ''It's not supposed to be a political instruction,'' he said. ''I don't know what kind of people would take instruction from a shirt that you find at a store. I hope those people aren't voting, actually.''
Statistically, Mr. Keddie's T-shirt is correct: about a third of people 18 to 24 vote, as opposed to two-thirds of people over 65. Boosters of the youth vote perennially predict a higher turnout, and this time, they say, the war and the Web will pull in more young people. ''More young people say they plan to vote next fall than at any time during the 1996 and 2000 elections,'' said Hans Riemer, the political director of Rock the Vote.
The smart money says believe it when you see it.
