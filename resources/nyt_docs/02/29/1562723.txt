Israeli helicopters fired missiles on Saturday night that killed three members of the Islamic Jihad faction as they traveled in a small car in Gaza City, Palestinian witnesses and officials said.
The Israeli strike caused a thunderous explosion and destroyed the sedan as it moved through the northern part of the city. More than a dozen bystanders were hurt, including a 6-year-old boy who suffered life-threatening injuries, said doctors at Shifa Hospital.
Hundreds of Palestinians rushed to the site, immediately surrounding the scorched car. Some helped remove the wounded, while others climbed atop the mangled vehicle and called for revenge.
Israel's military said the attack was aimed at ''senior Islamic Jihad terrorists'' who had helped plan multiple attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians.
Palestinian officials and relatives identified the dead as Mahmoud Joudah, an Islamic Jihad leader in the area, and two cousins, Ayman and Anin al-Dahduh, who also belonged to the group. Islamic Jihad has carried out many of the suicide bombings and shootings against Israel.
Israel's military has staged dozens of targeted killings against Palestinians suspected of involvement in violence against Israel.
Many of the airstrikes take place in the Gaza Strip, and in Gaza City in particular. In the West Bank, Israel generally pursues suspects with the ground troops that have been in or near most Palestinian cities for most of the past two years.
But Israel does not have such a presence in Palestinian cities in Gaza, and has often relied on the airstrikes. Palestinian civilians have often been killed or wounded in the strikes.
The last attack was on Feb. 7, when helicopters fired missiles that killed a prominent Islamic Jihad figure traveling in a car. A 12-year-old boy on the sidewalk was also killed.
