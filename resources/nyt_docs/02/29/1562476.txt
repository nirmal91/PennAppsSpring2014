When Charles McGrath (The Way We Live Now, Feb. 15) writes that ''the unspoken theme of all the really good political thrillers . . . is not good versus evil but pretty bad versus slightly worse,'' what he is saying is that ambiguity is what makes novels compelling. Good versus evil isn't interesting or rich enough for a satisfying novel; the works of Tom Clancy prove that point. But you don't have to be a moral relativist either; the Nazis were evil, and the Communists, along with contemporary terrorists, were just as bad.
The novelist's job is to make the reader see the people behind movements or ideologies as human, even when they do inhuman things; novels are more about people and actions than ideas. It is the characters and how they behave that interest readers.
In addition to the justly noted titles by Alan Furst and Robert Wilson, readers interested in good thrillers might try Henning Mankell's ''Dogs of Riga'' or a novel set in Sarajevo, ''The Small Boat of Great Sorrows,'' by Dan Fesperman.
