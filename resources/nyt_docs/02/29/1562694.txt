On Thursday, the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, kicked off its seventh annual National Corporate Governance Conference.
Duke Bristow, an economist at U.C.L.A. who helped organize the two-day event, which focused this year on the financial impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on companies, said the conference was ''a little more uneventful'' than last year's. During the 2003 event, which attracted about 150 executives from companies of all sizes, the bombing of Baghdad had just begun, and Mr. Bristow had to set up televisions in conference rooms so participants could watch war coverage.
But there was one advantage to all that hubbub: every speaker showed up as planned. ''Because of the war, all was quiet on the corporate front,'' he said.
