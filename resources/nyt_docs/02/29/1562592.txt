For those who think going to the refrigerator for a can of soda is just too obvious, there's a cool new alternative. Maytag is introducing the first beverage vending machine made expressly for residential use. Called SkyBox, it dispenses up to four different beverages, with room for 66 12-ounce cans, 33 12-ounce bottles or some combination. Lest the machine clash with the d√©cor, SkyBox, just under two feet wide and three feet tall, comes with a black or platinum finish and can be fitted with custom panels decorated with drawings, photographs or sports team logos. Soon to be available at Home Depot stores, it comes with a lock, which is wise since icy drinks tumble forth with no money required -- aside, of course, from the $499 purchase price.
