To the Editor:
Did it occur to your writer that young people engage in this behavior because their parents don't set rules or impose consequences?
There are teenagers who are clean and sober, go to 12-step meetings, and are also into punk and rock. These teens in recovery are musicians in bands, are smart, and have functional families that set rules and demand respect.
Check the Web site for Road Recovery, which sponsors the band Keeping it Real, with the Caron Foundation. The band is made up of teen-agers who are creative, committed to sobriety and still have meaningful relationships with their families, their communities and the world.
