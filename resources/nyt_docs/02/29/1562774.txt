Re ''Theory vs. Reality,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 23):
According to the experts, I'm an example of someone who was able to bounce back after my engineering job at Hewlett-Packard left for India without me. I'm pursuing a master's degree in civil engineering.
It is frustrating to hear people harping about the need for more training and better education. Here's a news flash: because of the diverse knowledge base of each field of engineering and science, more education and training usually means a college degree in another field. How in the world is someone who has to support a family going to go to college while still having enough money to pay the rent and feed the family?
Step out of your ivory tower and live in the real world with the rest of us.
