He may have all the right moves on the tennis court, but can Andre Agassi hack it as a businessman?
He took the first step in that direction last week, opening the 24 Hour Fitness Agassi Super-Sport Club in his hometown, Summerlin, Nev. The club is among several that Mr. Agassi will open in the Las Vegas area as part of a new partnership with 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, a chain of more than 300 health clubs in 16 states.
The club has Mr. Agassi's personality ''written all over it,'' said Mark Mastrov, the chief executive of 24 Hour Fitness. Large, colorful photographs show Mr. Agassi whacking the ball around the court.
Mr. Agassi, who is 33 and ranked as one of the top five male tennis players in the world, said he signed the health club deal because of his love for fitness. ''Working out in gyms is the reason I still get to play tennis for a living,'' he said. ''It keeps me young.''
He said he plans to be a regular at the club, which is down the street from his home. But there may be some distractions while he pumps iron. ''Whenever I look up, I see the photos of myself on the wall,'' he said. ''I'm going to try and ignore them as best I can.''
