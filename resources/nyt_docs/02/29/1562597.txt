The latest skin-refining masks rely on enzymes derived from plants and fruits, including pineapple, papaya and sugar cane, which are said to exfoliate more gently than acid peels. ''They're effective and nonirritating, especially for people who have abused their skin with too many acids,'' said Dr. Debra Jaliman, a New York dermatologist who suggests them for clients whose skin is too sensitive for harsher products.
From Amorepacific, the Treatment Enzyme Peel ($50 at Bergdorf Goodman) features papain, an enzyme derived from green papaya described as able to slough off dead skin cells thoroughly but gently. The Violet Flame Enzyme Mask from Astara also contains papain; $37 (877-427-8272). Astara says it subscribes to raw food practices: to protect the potency of enzymes and vitamins, it never heats products above 103 degrees.
Z. Bigatti is introducing the Illuminate Exfoliating Skin Treatment, with papain and bromelain, an enzyme derived from pineapples ($175 at Saks Fifth Avenue in late March). Rounding out the list is the Juice Beauty Green Apple Enzyme Peel ($48 at Sephora), which features enzymes extracted from apples -- along with a little lemon and sugar cane.
