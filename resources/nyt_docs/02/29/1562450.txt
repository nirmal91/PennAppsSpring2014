of the Antiquarian Book Trade.

One of the specialized commercial neighborhoods that once dotted Manhattan was the used book district on Fourth Avenue between, roughly, Union Square and Astor Place. For more than 70 years, beginning in the last decade of the 19th century, blocks and blocks of sidewalk bins filled with bargains, and scores of disorderly shops, piled high with dusty volumes, rivaled the quays of Paris and the bookshops of London's Charing Cross Road. Although barely a shadow remains, Book Row has left behind a colorful history almost as cluttered as one of its stores. According to Marvin Mondlin, a veteran of more than 50 years in the trade, and Roy Meador, a book collector and writer, it is a history of the strange business practices of stranger personalities. ''You had to beg those guys to sell you a book,'' as Fran Lebowitz puts it. And consider Eleanor Lowenstein, who knew all there was to know about cookbooks but virtually nothing about actual cooking; she gave a lunch of canned soup served in jelly jars. From time to time, the proudly independent merchants put aside differences to beat back threats, from defenders of public morals trolling for banned books to a proposed city ordinance banning sidewalk stalls. But nothing -- particularly not selling paperbacks at five for a dollar -- could defeat the curse of rising rents. There are still used bookstores scattered about the city, but the loss of this unique neighborhood, as ''Book Row'' illustrates time and again, is one to be mourned.
