What defines cultural landmarks in the city and beyond? Are they defined by heritage or architecture? How are they saved?
''Cultural Landmarks: Controversy, Practice and Prospects,'' a three-day conference sponsored by the Historic Districts Council, is to explore such topics, beginning at 6 p.m. on Friday with a reception at the Edgar J. Kaufmann Conference Rooms, at 809 United Nations Plaza (First Avenue) between East 45th and 46th Streets. The cost is $25, except for students, the elderly and council members, who pay $20.
On Saturday, the conference will be at the New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street. A keynote address on efforts to preserve and interpret fragments of the city's past will be delivered at 9:30 a.m. by John Kuo Wei Tchen, author of ''New York Before Chinatown,'' and three panels will be held. The fee is $15 for students, the elderly and council members and $25 for others.
On Sunday, there will be three-hour walking tours of Harlem, the Upper West Side, the East Village and Chinatown; Fort Greene, Brooklyn; Flushing, Queens; and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. Each tour costs $25 and is to begin at 10 a.m. Information is available at www.hdc.org.
