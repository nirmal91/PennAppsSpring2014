As one who served in World War II, I found your report on wounded veterans of Iraq a hurtful read, and not only because it made me feel these kids' pain. It is disturbing to hear that these soldiers sense the war will stay with them ''but after a point the Army won't.'' If they are right and are eventually neglected, we're shamefully wrong as a nation.
Aspirants to elective office should not be quibbling about who did what in the service. They should be committing themselves to promising these men and women, especially those whose lives have been permanently damaged, that they will not be forsaken.
