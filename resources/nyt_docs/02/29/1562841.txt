To the Editor:
Re ''May the Biggest Bar Mitzvah Win?'' (column, Feb. 22): The most important part of a bar mitzvah is the religious education and preparation that precede it. Second is the religious ceremony. Least important is the party, if there is one. Of course, a party can be fun, but it should not be a competition, nor so elaborate that it becomes forever the high spot in the child's or the family's life.
