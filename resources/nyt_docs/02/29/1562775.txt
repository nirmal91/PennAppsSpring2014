To the Editor:
Bob Herbert's defense of the average worker (column, Feb. 23), while noble, is based on the myth of the American dream.
Who is the average American worker? Large swaths of the population have worked for years at the minimum wage. In addition, they struggle in the health care bracket between Medicaid and insurance.
The outrage at the economic stresses on the previously comfortable middle class is justified, but it sounds hollow, I'm sure, to those who have no hope of reaching middle class.
Even in high-quality jobs, employees work more hours for fewer benefits and less paid vacation than in comparably wealthy countries like Britain, France and Germany.
Purveyors of the American dream should consider that years of complacency among trade unions and legislators in the face of longer working hours and rising health costs are also responsible for the instability the middle classes are facing today.
