In presidential election years since 1964, February, on average, has been the only down month of the year for stocks. So it is notable that the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index beat the odds this month, managing a gain of 1.2 percent despite falling on nine of the 19 trading days during the month.
The Dow Jones industrial average also rose for the month, by 0.9 percent. But the Nasdaq composite index stumbled, falling 1.8 percent.
For the week, the Nasdaq was down 8.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,029.82. It was its sixth consecutive weekly decline, the longest such streak since the sell-off that ended on Oct. 4, 2002. The Dow slipped 35.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,583.92, while the S.&amp;P. 500 inched up 0.83 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,144.94.
Among the best performers for the month were Wal-Mart Stores, Walt Disney, Biogen Idec, Petsmart, Allegheny Technologies and AT&amp;T Wireless Services. For the week, McDonald's, the Altria Group, Petsmart, Research in Motion, Pulte Homes and the Andrew Corporation had the best returns.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note plunged to 3.98 percent, from 4.09 percent a week earlier.
