Several hundred people, most of Haitian descent, marched through Brooklyn yesterday to protest the policies of the United States and France toward the armed rebellion in Haiti, and to demonstrate support for Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's beleaguered president.
The marchers, who gathered about noon in Crown Heights, walked several miles to Grand Army Plaza, where several speakers harshly criticized the Bush administration for what they called subversive and racist attempts to displace Mr. Aristide.
''What unified us out there today was a determination to see that the Haitian people have a right to self-determination,'' said Dustin Langley, an organizer for the International Action Center, one of the groups that organized the March.
One focus of the marchers' anger were statements by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, calling for Mr. Aristide to cede power.
People in the crowd waved placards reading ''U.S. &amp; France: Stop Supporting Subversion in Haiti'' and ''Election, Yes, Coup d'Etat, No.''
''Aristide, whatever you think of him, is democratically elected, and it is not for the U.S. to call for his overthrow or fund groups working for his overthrow,'' Mr. Langley said in an interview last night.
The police said the demonstration was peaceful and there were no arrests.
