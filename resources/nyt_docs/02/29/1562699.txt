To the Editor:
Re ''That Big Fat Budget Deficit. Yawn.'' (Feb. 8), which described the calm in the bond market and elsewhere about the government's deficit spending:
Both liberal Democrats and so-called conservative Republicans have given up balancing the budget, believing that the best way to grease the wheels of re-election is to load up on pork-barrel projects. Democrats and Republicans have morphed into one inside-the-Beltway party. Liberals won't say no to social welfare programs, and conservatives are the same way about military spending. They are leaving the next generation an inheritance of government debt in the trillions of dollars.
The debt clock in Manhattan has been a beacon of light reminding us of this ticking time bomb that could destroy our long-term financial security.
