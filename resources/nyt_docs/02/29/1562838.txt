The Suffolk County Campaign Finance Board last week released an analysis of the 2003 election and declared the year ''a disappointing year for Suffolk's nascent public financing program'' because none of the candidates for county executive or county legislator participated.
The program, which was approved by voters in 1998, provides public campaign funds to a candidate who agrees to adhere to campaign contribution and spending limits.
Instead, candidates for county executive raised and spent record amounts of money. For the primary and general elections, the Democrat, Steve Levy, raised $1.14 million and spent $981,366, while the Republican, Edward P. Romaine, raised $1.53 million and spent nearly $1.45 million.
The fact that 7 of 18 legislative seats were actually or virtually uncontested elections ''remains a problem for Suffolk County democracy,'' the report said. Two legislative districts did not have a major party opponent; two other districts included major party candidates who raised and spent no campaign money; and three other districts had losing candidates who were outspent by their opponents by a ratio of at least 13 to 1.
