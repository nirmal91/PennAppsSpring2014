To the Sports Editor:
Chris Broussard's article on the dunk (''A Game Played Above the Rim, Above All Else,'' Feb. 15) was full of great tidbits about the history of this game-transforming shot. Where I part ways with Broussard is at the point of his assertion that ''Michael Jordan improved on Erving. . . . '' Having followed Erving's career closely, I think it is clear that no one, including the otherwise iconic Mr. Jordan, has improved on what Julius Erving did with the dunk shot.
The dunk, for Doc, punished and demoralized foes and left those of us who were fortunate enough to observe and even try to emulate him with a perpetual smiling gasp. No one has done it better and I await the arrival of someone who might do it as well.
