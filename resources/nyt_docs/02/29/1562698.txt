To the Editor:
Re ''Your Next Boss Could Be a Temp'' (Executive Life, Feb. 15), about the growing numbers of temporary senior executives:
The use of such executives is a win-win situation. The company gets experienced input with more objectivity, and the senior executive gets a lucrative challenge.
If we are to believe the theorists that the universe is a seamless whole, such a temporary assignment gives the executive and the company a chance to see if the relationship works, without falling off the planet. And there is minimal acrimony if the relationship doesn't create the desired order out of chaos. As baby-boomer executives age, they can still feel groovy, or at least needed, in such jobs.
