JAPAN UNBOUND
A Volatile Nation's Quest
for Pride and Purpose.
By John Nathan.
Houghton Mifflin, $25.
In ''Japan Unbound,'' John Nathan, a professor of Japanese cultural studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, investigates what he calls ''the troubling if often vaguely perceived sense of being lost'' experienced by many Japanese people, a situation marked by a ''deeply unsettling emptiness.'' He gives portraits of politicians, a hugely popular cartoonist, maverick entrepreneurs who have broken out of Japan's rigidly company-dominated culture to start their own ventures, and dispirited students who suddenly stop attending school. Nathan's analysis is dominated by these interviews with the atypical rather than people who more closely exemplify the identity crisis he set out to explore; he gives a fuzzy picture of this malaise. Nevertheless, his extensive reportage, combined with an understanding of Japanese culture gained from his years as a student, gives an insightful study of a culture little understood in the United States.
