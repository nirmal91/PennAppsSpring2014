A traveling exhibition on endangered wildlife in New Jersey that has been circling the state for nearly a year is ready to land at Terminal B of Newark Liberty International Airport.
The exhibit, which opens on Monday and is scheduled to stay at the airport for a month, is meant to commemorate 30 years of effort since the passage of the state's Endangered Species Conservation Act to bring back regional species from the brink of extinction, including both eagles and osprey.
Incorporated in the exhibit is an interactive 12-by-8-foot plasma ''wall'' that pulls together video, audio and graphics.
New Jersey has dozens of threatened or endangered species. So, the state Department of Environmental Protection, through its Division of Fish and Wildlife's Endangered and Nongame Species Program, still has a big job to do. The program receives no dedicated government funds for its biologists and depends on donations from the public to fund their work. The major source of revenue is the sale of Conserve Wildlife license plates that began in 1993.
But why take the exhibit to the airport? Linda Tesauro, executive director of the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey, a nonprofit arm of the Endangered and Nongame Species Program, says that placing it in Terminal B allows it to be seen by passengers on departing international flights who might have overlooked the beauties of their own state. Maybe, on return, they will take a closer look at what they have missed.
