We were pleased that our forthcoming novel, ''The Rule of Four,'' by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason, was included in your essay on thrillers. Although it shares certain characteristics with ''The Da Vinci Code'' and we hope it will be as successful, it is not, as Charles McGrath suggests, a '''Da Vinci Code' knockoff.'' ''The Rule of Four'' took the authors five years to write and was acquired before ''The Da Vinci Code'' was published.
