To the Sports Editor:
Chris Broussard reports that Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O'Neal are the leading candidates to be the Man in the N.B.A., with Duncan perceived to be the front-runner (''Who's The Man?'' Feb. 22). He deserves to be considered the foremost contender, but it is worth keeping in mind that it is easier to be the Man when playing alongside the Admiral (David Robinson), as Duncan did until this season. Thus this year's playoffs ought to be especially telling about whether Duncan really is ''the ultimate franchise player.''
