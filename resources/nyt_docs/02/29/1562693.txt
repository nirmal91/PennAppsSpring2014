L. Dennis Kozlowski's old office has a new tenant: Leon Black. Apollo Management, a private equity firm run by Mr. Black, has leased Tyco International's former office space at 9 West 57th Street, which has sweeping views of Central Park.
Tyco's new chief executive, Edward D. Breen, left the expensive space to move the company's offices to New Jersey.
Mr. Black, a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert, is planning to use Mr. Kozlowski's office. ''The desk is going to be changed,'' Mr. Black joked.
