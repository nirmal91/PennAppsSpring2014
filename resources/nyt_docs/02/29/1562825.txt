Presidential pundits take note: if you pick a horse too early in the race, you risk watching your front-runner end up at the glue factory rather than the finish line.
''Howard Dean will be the next president of the United States because he is inspiring people to believe in democracy again,'' Governor McGreevey predicted in a speech last December as he became the first governor to back Dr. Dean.
But inspiration soon turned to desperation: Dr. Dean took a drubbing in the early primaries and, after losing his 17th state contest, dropped out of the race. For people like Mr. McGreevey, former Vice President Al Gore and other political gamblers with a shrinking stack of chips, the message was clear. All bets were off.
''The governor's decision to prematurely endorse Howard Dean reflects badly just as a matter of judgment more than anything else,'' mused Brian Nelson, executive director of the Republican State Committee. ''That will probably hurt him the most among other Democrats in New Jersey who were compelled to get behind him in endorsing Howard Dean, who imploded shortly thereafter.''
In the meantime, Governor McGreevey and other implosion victims are regrouping.
The Star-Ledger reported on Thursday that the governor was getting back in the saddle and is expected soon to announce his support for Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
''What happens next is that the governor's been in conversation with the remaining campaigns,'' Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, said on Monday. ''He's talking to other Dean supporters, and at this point no decision has been made.''
Will patience trump punditry?
Probably not.
