To the Editor:
Mr. Rich is absolutely right. Just as in the inevitable slowdown past an automobile accident to try to detect dead or mangled bodies, we have become a nation of mental rubbernecks who decry sex and violence on ''family entertainment'' like the Super Bowl. Ms. Jackson was the only empowered woman on the entire program. Justin Timberlake, on the other hand, is a laughingstock if for no other reason than his denials are so hilarious.
