For more than 25 years, Tim Barnwell has been keeping a close eye on the people and topography of Southern Appalachia, a region of family farms and tobacco fields, rolling hills giving way to steep mountain passes and communities that have, in their relative isolation, developed a distinctive way of life. Equipped with a 4-by-5 camera, Barnwell, who was himself raised in the area, combed the back roads of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee to find its tobacco farmers, quilt makers, ballad singers and molasses brewers not only to photograph but also to gather testimonies on a way of life that has been slow to change over the years. Yet, with the advent of new highways and new housing developments, change is the inevitable theme of THE FACE OF APPALACHIA: Portraits From the Mountain Farm (Norton, $29.95). Stirring as the more than 100 black-and-white photographs are, the book's 37 pages of interviews are equally riveting. Here you will learn a few tips on making molasses (''when it drips off in about an inch-long drop,'' it's ready), when to harvest tobacco (the cut stalk should resemble ''corn bread that's been cooked with too much baking soda''), how to avoid getting jumped on by a bear (''you never want to get below him. . . . I've seen 'em leap 12 feet at a bound even uphill and if you're below 'em, they can be on you before you know it'') and, repeatedly, the theme of independence: ''All we have is what we can make,'' says Marian Anderson, who once used leftover yarn from hosiery mills to make her hand-hooked rugs. More than a volume of photographs, ''The Face of Appalachia'' is a notable work of anthropology.
