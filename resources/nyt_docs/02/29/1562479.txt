Recently I received a photograph of George and Laura Bush in the mail. As a longtime Democrat, I was quite disturbed by the inscription, which thanked me for my expected political support. Your article helped to clarify for me why the Bush campaign might have believed that it was able to decode my political DNA.
Do the Republicans consider my license as a family and marriage therapist a signal to them that I might vote for Bush? Or my religious affiliation in the Presbyterian Church? Or the fact that I am married with children?
It is precisely for the above reasons that I would not vote Republican. By utilizing data-mining technology, Republicans have given themselves quite a compliment if they believe they know this voter!
