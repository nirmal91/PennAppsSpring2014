Looking for a fresh color scheme for your Shore house? How about Laura's Pink Fudge, with a trim of Morey's Pier Ruby and maybe a splash of Jolly Roger Gold?
Main Street Wildwood, its feet wedged firmly in the 1950's, but only in the best way, has come up with a palate of 36 colors authentic to the Shore haven's vaunted roots in that era of doo-wop, the group singing style characterized by nonsense syllables and a strong, rhythmic beat.
Margaret Westfield, an architectural and preservation consultant based in Haddon Heights, perused old magazines and took chips from un-repainted features at Wildwood motels to come up with colors that were used on local commercial buildings in the resort's heyday, the 50's and 60's.
''I then scoured around town, seeing if I could match the colors to current buildings,'' Ms. Westfield said. The result is the 36-color palate, with each color named after the motel, shop or building where Ms. Westfield found it matched.
Thus, Caribbean Green is the vibrant green color found at the Caribbean Motel, and Lu Fran Concord is the purple-grape hue of the Lu Fran Motel nearby.
The Wildwood Sherwin-Williams store is prepared to mix the new/old colors and donate part of the profit back to Main Street Wildwood, a nonprofit agency that helps coordinate events and programs for the local business community.
''Doo-wop is what makes Wildwood what it is,'' said Ms. Westfield, who does consulting for Main Street New Jersey, an agency that helps 17 towns in the state promote their business districts. ''The more authentic it can be, the better it is. And these colors are just fun.''
