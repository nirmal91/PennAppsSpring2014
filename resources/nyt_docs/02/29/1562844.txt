In 1968 my husband almost died from tularemia, an Asian rodent disease related to bubonic plague. It is transmitted by insects and is frequently fatal. Since he never visited Asia, nobody could explain where he caught this disease other than that he spent much time out in the woods bordering Peconic Bay. Only a few years ago, when government information was declassified, did I read that tularemia bacilli were cultivated on Plum Island for possible use in biological warfare. My husband died in 1994, at age 69, from viral liver disease also of unexplained origins.
