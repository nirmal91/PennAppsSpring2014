There is a certain attraction in harking back to the old days, especially in trying to revive them in contemporary ways. This can often be fertile, the source of new ideas, but it can just as often be disastrous. It is not easy to thrust yourself into the thinking of a past epoch. It is entertaining to deride ancient errors, but these should not blind you to what the old-timers did understand.
The game between the grandmasters Bartlomiej Macieja of Poland and Giovanni Vescovi of Brazil in Round 6 of the Fourways Inn Grandmaster Tournament, held Jan. 15 to 25 in Bermuda, is instructive. It was also beneficial for Vescovi, who compiled the winning 7-3 score in the six-man double-round-robin invitational event. Both players were willing to play into an old-fashioned variation, but only Vescovi got into the spirit of the thing, while Macieja failed to match him.
With 3 Bc5, the Giuoco Piano (Italian for quiet game) arises. Actually, it is a quiet, slow-maneuvering mode of play only if White continues with 4 d3, the Pianissimo. If White plays 4 c3, as Macieja does here, aggressively aiming to take over the center, it is anything but pianissimo.
For over a century, it has been accepted that if Black wishes to avoid inferiority he must fight back energetically, as Vescovi does with 4 Nf6. If, instead, Black plays 4 d6?!, he gets pushed around by 5 d4 Bb6.
After 5 d4 ed 6 e5, Vescovi continues the plan of striking back with 6 d5, preparing to meet 7 ef with dc 8 fg Rg8 9 Bg5 Qd6, which would leave him with the more effective mobilization.
After 8 Bb6, a correspondence game, Schwan/Michaelson, 1892/93, went cautiously with 9 Be3 O-O 10 Qc2 Ne7 11 Nc3 Nc3 12 bc Bf5 13 Bd3 Bd3 14 Qd3, with equal chances for both sides. But this time Macieja seems to think he's onto something wonderful.
His 10 Bc6 bc, though, is the first step toward weakening his light squares.
After 11 f5!, Macieja is already in a quandary: he must guard against f4 if he is to castle kingside, but he cannot do this by playing 12 Ne4? because 12 de 13 Ng1 f4 yields Vescovi a crushing attack. So he instead played 12 ef Qf6 13 Ne4 de 14 Nd2.
At that point, Macieja may have been expecting the routine 14 Bf5, but Vescovi struck with a strong gambit -- 14 Ba6! -- preventing castling.
After 15 Ne4 Ba5, Macieja could not retreat with 16 Nd2? because 16 c5! 17 Qa4 cd 18 Bd4 Bd2 19 Kd2 Rad8 20 Kc3 Qg6 21 Rad1 c5 22 Bc5 Rd3 23 Rd3 Qd3 24 Kb4 Rf4 wins. In this line, 18 Qd4 Qd4 19 Bd4 Rad8 20 Be3 Rd2! 21 Bd2 Re8 22 Kd1 Rd8 23 Kc2 Rd2 also wins for Black.
But 16 Nc3 was quickly besieged by 16 Bc3 17 bc Qg6 18 Rb1 Bd3 19 Rb7 Bc2 20 Qe2 Rab8.
After 23 Ke2 Rb2 24 Qc5 Bb3 25 Kf3 Bd5 26 Kf4 Qe4 27 Kg3 Qg2 28 Kf4 Qh1, Macieja, a rook down and with his one check, 29 Qf8, blocked by 29 Bg8, gave up.
