The Carver Center Community Action Program's food pantry is running low.
While the center would normally serve about 400 families a month, the demand increased dramatically this winter to more than 500 a month, said Nancy Haneman, a spokeswoman for the center.
With four months remaining in the center's budget year, it has exhausted most of the money used to help stock the pantry.
''We've just seen a tremendous increase in new clients and these people are hungry,'' Ms. Haneman said. ''Really hungry.''
Food donations can be brought directly to the center, at 400 Westchester Avenue in Port Chester. The center is especially in need of canned vegetables, pasta and rice.
''We're not going to let the food pantry close, but we need donations,'' Ms. Haneman said.
The center, which has served the Port Chester area for more than 60 years, provides services ranging from food, clothing and furniture to a free after-school program and programs for teens.
Its annual fund-raiser is being held next Saturday from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at Manhattanville College's Reid Castle. Tickets are $75 and can be purchased by calling the center, at (914)939-4464 or sending a check.
