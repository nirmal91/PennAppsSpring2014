AN aspiring priest, in flowing tribal robes, is sent by his Nigerian village on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. But when he lands at Ben-Gurion International Airport, the Israeli authorities immediately nab him as an illegal immigrant. A shady businessman bribes a guard to free him, then sends him to work cleaning high-rise apartments in Tel Aviv.
''James's Journey to Jerusalem'' (opening at Film Forum in New York on Friday), Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's hilarious and poignant debut feature, explores the sacred and profane impulses that shape both Israeli society and its individuals. James (the charismatic Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe) is a quick learner; his transformation from hard-working, wide-eyed servant of God to canny entrepreneur is a biting (if affectionate) satire of a Zionist dream gone wildly awry in a land of traffic jams and shopping malls.
''I realized that my country has two existences,'' Mr. Alexandrowicz, 34, said on a recent visit to New York, ''this abstract existence, in the minds of so many people, and the very practical existence of a normal -- or almost normal -- country. In Judaism, we have an expression for this split between fantasy and reality. We call it 'the Jerusalem of above and the Jerusalem of below.' In that gap, I thought, begins a film.''
Mr. Alexandrowicz was born and grew up in the latter Jerusalem, where he studied filmmaking. His documentary, ''The Inner Tour'' (2000), which followed a group of West Bank Palestinians on a three-day bus tour of Israel, was remarkable for its sensitive handling of emotions about to explode in a second intifada.
What does it mean to make a film like ''James's Journey'' -- a send-up of Western materialism -- at a time when Israel's economy is crumbling?
''It means that this modern philosophy of grabbing whatever you can doesn't always get you the best results in the long run,'' Mr. Alexandrowicz said. ''Whoever you left behind will come knocking on your door.''
