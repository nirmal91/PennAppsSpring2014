To the Editor:
Re ''Unhappy Hour'' (letter, Feb. 22):
No doubt you got angry letters about moms getting together for drinks with their babies in tow (news article, Feb. 20). But I understand the rationale behind the ''Tots and Tonic'' happy hours: at-home motherhood is often exhausting, tedious and lonely.
How can I say that is so when, these days, staying at home with your kids is considered a privilege? Because parenting is the same tough job that it was a generation ago, only more lonely now that the majority of moms are working.
And with the divorce rate hovering at 50 percent, it's more of a career and a financial gamble.
So let these moms enjoy themselves and get out once a month for a beer.
After all, their 24/7 jobs of changing dirty diapers, soothing colicky babies and wiping spit-up off their shirts is enough to drive a person to drink.
