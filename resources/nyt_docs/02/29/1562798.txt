Despite the Pentagon's announcement last Monday that it was planning to end its Comanche helicopter program, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents workers at Sikorsky Aircraft, said it would work to get the decision overturned.
Harvey L. Jackson, president of the Teamsters Local 1150, said Tuesday that the union had already spoken with state lawmakers and was planning to meet with Sikorsky officials.
''We're very confident that if there is any hope to revitalize this program, it will come through the Connecticut delegation,'' he said.
Mr. Jackson said about 400 union members are working on the Comanche. He said about 50 highly skilled members would be affected in the short term if the program were ended.
''Part of what we do here is to relocate those people into other programs, the Blackhawk and Seahawk programs, which are very healthy programs,'' he said.
Mr. Jackson also said it was important for the union to take a calm approach to the announcement. He also expects the union to get involved at the national level.
''We're in the defense industry,'' he said. We've been here before. We've heard things like this before. The bad news is that we're dealing with something that is very common in the defense industry. The good news is that we have a seasoned team in place and all the connections are there. We're going to put our talent and resources together to try to revitalize this program.''
