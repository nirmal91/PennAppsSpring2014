With two contracts that could affect 6,000 workers in the state set to expire April 3, negotiations between SBC Connecticut and the Communications Workers of America began last week.
Both company and union officials said the cost of heath care benefits would be a major issue.
Walt Sharpe, a spokesman for SBC, said company revenues were down $11 billion since 2000, while its costs for health care benefits had increased at a double-digit rate to almost $3 billion a year during the same period.
''The issues of declining revenues and the increase in costs for health care benefits are definitely going to be discussed at the bargaining table,'' he said.
Paul J. Hongo Jr., president of C.W.A. Local 1298, said he wanted to maintain health care benefits for active employees and retirees. He said the union was also concerned about job security.
''We want to make sure our members get first dibs on new opportunities,'' he said. ''We're also concerned about consolidation involving our call centers, and we also have reason to believe that SBC is considering moving that type of work overseas.''
Both sides had come to an agreement before the negotiations began. The union pledged to give 30 days' notice before any labor action, while the company promised it would not cut off heath benefits in the event a labor action did take place.
''That shows a willingness by both parties to want to stay at the table and negotiate a fair settlement,'' Mr. Hongo said.
