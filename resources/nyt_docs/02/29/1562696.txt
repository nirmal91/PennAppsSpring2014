To the Editor:
Daniel Gross correctly ends his column, ''Whose Problem is Health Care?'' (Economic View, Feb. 8) with this statement: ''Whatever way, we all pay.'' And, indeed, the problem is us.
People are focusing only on who pays for health care -- employers, government or consumers -- without addressing the core issue.
Consider cancer. The costs that are associated with diagnosis, treatment and convalescence run into billions of dollars. Yet there are many available ways to reduce cancer risk, so the future could be much brighter.
The major solution to health care is all around us. It just must become a priority, an investment objective, for each one of us and for our society as a whole.
