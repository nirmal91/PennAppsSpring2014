To the Editor:
I read with pleasure Bob Herbert's column, ''Bliss and Bigotry,'' and then with dismay your news article ''State Action Is Pursued on Same-Sex Marriage,'' both on Feb. 27.
I have been married to the same man for a few months shy of 50 years and do not feel that the legal union, religious or civil, of gay couples has any effect on our relationship.
The suggestion by Georgia Democrats of a constitutional ban on adultery makes more sense than one banning gay marriages. Of course, the adultery law would never be seriously proposed or enacted. Too many people in high places would be lawbreakers.
Congratulations and mazel tov to Deborah Gar Reichman and Shelley Curnow, who plan to marry in May and were interviewed by Mr. Herbert.
And by the way, can I get Ms. Reichman's recipe for noodle kugel?
