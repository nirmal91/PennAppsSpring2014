The Long Island Power Authority will allow residential customers to buy electricity produced by nonpolluting, renewable technologies for about $7.50 to $12 more a month than what they now pay for power from conventional sources, the authority announced last week.
The option, called the Green Choice Program, will link customers to so-called green power marketers of electricity produced in New York State by solar installations, wind turbines and biomass sources such as methane gas from landfills.
If the LIPA trustees approve the program at a meeting on March 24, bill inserts will advise customers how to contact marketers directly. Links to marketers will also appear on the LIPA Web page, www.lipower.org. The marketers are registered with the New York Public Service Commission and currently supply similar services to customers of Niagara Mohawk, an upstate utility with its own green option.
Customers will be able to purchase all or some of their power from the marketer they select. They may also arrange mixes of renewable sources, choosing, for example, all solar power or a combination of solar and wind power. At least some of the power will be from hydroelectric plants.
Large generation stations that burn oil and natural gas produce nearly all power LIPA now sells to its 1.1 million customers. The authority also owns an 18 percent share of the Nine Mile Point Two nuclear power plant in Oswego, and imports power from that plant for use on Long Island.
Richard M. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, said the new program would advance an initiative by Gov. George E. Pataki for renewable sources to provide 25 percent of all power consumed by in the state by 2013.
