After an eight-year absence, commercial jet service is returning to Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport.
Last Monday, the Tweed-New Haven Airport Authority and Comair, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, announced that the airline would be running three nonstop, round-trip flights to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport beginning May 27.
Comair said that by flying to Delta's second-largest hub, passengers would be able to connect with over 580 flights to about 120 domestic and international destinations.
Comair will have a 40-seat Bombardier CRJ regional jet departing New Haven at 6 a.m., 1:20 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. daily for the hour and half trip. Return flights are scheduled to land at 1 p.m., 4:55 p.m. and 11 p.m.
Nick Miller, a spokesman for Comair, said the cost would depend on the itinerary of each passenger. He said the service would result in about 20 new jobs at Tweed Airport.
Comair's decision came after local businesses and nonprofit institutions agreed to put up $1.6 million to cover any losses in the first year.
Bruce D. Alexander, the vice president and director of New Haven and state affairs at Yale University, who led the effort, said the university, the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven, the Knights of Columbus and New Haven Savings Bank were the major donors.
''Everyone recognized the importance of the airport in attracting business to Southern Connecticut,'' he said.
Rick A. Lamport, the airport's manager, said Comair's presence would mean additional landing fees, fuel fees and terminal rental.
''This market is arguably the second or third most underserviced in the country, he said. ''This airport is closer to 1.4 million residents than any airport in the state.''
US Airways Express currently runs turboprop service to Philadelphia out of Tweed Airport.
