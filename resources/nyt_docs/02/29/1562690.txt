Sam Solovey's unorthodox business plans on ''The Apprentice,'' the NBC reality show, led Donald Trump to fire him. But now Mr. Solovey, who tried unsuccessfully to sell a glass of lemonade for $1,000 on the show, is trying to parlay his pink slip into a new job: management guru.
Mr. Solovey, 28, of Chevy Chase, Md., is hoping to speak at team-building seminars and corporate functions, giving lessons on how to start a business and on the importance of relationships.
If his antics on ''The Apprentice'' were any indication, his talks might be titled ''How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.'' (He angered virtually all of his teammates on the show by sleeping through tasks and proposing outlandish ideas, like the expensive lemonade.)
But Mr. Solovey, who is asking for $2,000 to $3,000 a speech, promises more useful advice. ''Although I behaved in a certain way on the show, I actually don't function like that on a regular basis,'' he said.
Still, he has no plans to quit his day job soon. He is the director of sales and business operations at Potomac Tech Wire, a regional business news service with 80,000 subscribers; he was one of its co-founders.
Mr. Trump, who dismisses one contestant a week from the series, booted Mr. Solovey in January. Since then, Mr. Solovey has lined up some conference engagements and has appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Today.'' Even his former boss says he would hire him back -- at least, to speak.
''I think Sam would be terrific at motivating the people,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Sam has a lot to learn, but he also has a lot to teach.''
