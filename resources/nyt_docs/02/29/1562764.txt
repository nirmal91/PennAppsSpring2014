A 14-year-old boy has been arrested in the Jan. 17 shootings at the Galaxy Diner in Brooklyn. He was identified by the police yesterday as one of two gunmen who wounded nine patrons and employees during a robbery early that morning.
The police did not release the boy's name because he is a juvenile. They said he was arrested early Friday morning at an address on Batchelder Street in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.
In the January shootings, the police said, two people opened fire in the diner, at 805 Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York, sending breakfast customers diving for cover beneath tables. The gunmen then robbed several people of jewelry and money before fleeing in a car parked outside.
The shootings were remarkable in that few serious injuries resulted despite the number of shots fired. Two victims were grazed in the head by bullets; a third was shot in the chest and survived.
On Feb. 4, the police tracked one suspect, Ramel Simmons, 23, to an apartment in Albany, but he shot and killed himself before he could be arrested, the authorities said. A third suspect, Mark Blount, 27, of East New York, was arrested a week after the shooting and has been identified as the getaway driver, the police said.
Correction:  March 6, 2004, Saturday  An article in some copies on Sunday about the investigation into the shooting and robbery on Jan. 17 at the Galaxy Diner in East New York, Brooklyn, misstated the role that the police say Mark Blount, 27, played. He is charged with attempted robbery, assault and possession of a weapon, they said, but he is not believed to have acted as the getaway driver.
