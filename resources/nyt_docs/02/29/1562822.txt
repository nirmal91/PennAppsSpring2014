To the Editor:
The County Lines column, (''No Accounting for Tasteful Turrets? There Ought to Be a Law,'' Feb 22, by Marek Fuchs nicely crystallizes the problem facing Westchester residents and legislators alike: How to preserve the geographic beauty and rural feel so many county residents crave, without impeding a homeowner's right to square footage.
In Briarcliff Manor, our new Bulk Law, passed last September, allows generous-sized homes but now also requires larger setbacks as house size increases. A developer wishing to build a 10,000-square-foot home, for example, would need to plan for a buildable two-and-a-half acre lot, and would have to provide buffers between homes roughly three times the area required of a more modest 3,500-square-foot home. We respect the rights of both those who elect to build very large homes, and neighbors who may not want to feel dwarfed by a looming mass just a few feet from their property line.
We were careful to craft a law that subjects all new development to the new standards while allowing existing homeowners greater leeway. Setbacks for existing homes were grandfathered, and the new law is more generous to a variety of home designs, like ranch and other low-style houses.
As may be inevitable, opposition continues to come from a few local developers, who are now forced to plan their projects with additional consideration and sensitivity to existing neighbors. That protest, however, has been offset by the welcome reaction of residents relieved to find their property buffered and their privacy protected from an adjacent tear-down or new subdivision development.
