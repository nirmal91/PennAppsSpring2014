To the Editor:
The novel approach to Title IX discrimination and the results of the court case presented in the article ''Spring: Season of Bias in Girls' Soccer?'' (Feb. 22) were quite interesting. In spite of the outcome though, it appeared likely that the parents might never have felt compelled to bring the suit if the coaches for both the club and school teams had behaved like responsible adults -- putting the best interests of the girls first -- instead of behaving like petulant, self-important children who had to be sure that their team came first.
I have seen similar behavior at the grade-school level. What kind of message are these mentors and role models sending to children when they make all-or-nothing confrontation their modus operandi instead of compromise that addresses the child's desire to play her best, develop her skills, and accommodate both teams.
