Shoe designers are offering vertiginous takes on the classic 20's-era black and white oxfords known as spectators, typically decorated with perforations known as broguing. From the top: Jeffrey carries Manolo Blahnik sandals with a T-strap and spindle heels ($445). Christian Dior's round-toed spectator, called ''D Trick'' ($650), has a 4 3/4-inch heel and conjures the Hollywood glamour and man-tailoring of the shoe's namesake, Marlene Deitrich. At Saks Fifth Avenue, Isabella Fiore spectators are girlishly sexy, thanks to a d'orsay silhouette (closed toe and open sides), a white ankle strap and pin dots ($260). Ralph Lauren has a pointy shoe boot with a fringed kiltie and bow tassel ($650). And Tom Ford for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, inspired by the belle Ã©poque aristocrat Marquise Luisa Casati, offers patent leather spike heels with open back and sides ($575).
