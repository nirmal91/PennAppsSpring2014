To the Editor:
Mr. Rich, along with countless others, completely missed the point of the Janet Jackson fiasco. It's not about the breast; it's about the violence toward women. It is not entertainment to show a man rip a piece of clothing off a woman, especially when she feigns shock and humiliation. Ms. Jackson and Justin Timberlake are co-conspirators in this travesty against women. What are we teaching society when television, the most powerful media tool, glorifies a forcible assalt on a woman?
Mr. Rich, you are dead wrong about this debacle.
