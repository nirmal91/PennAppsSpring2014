To the Editor:
Re ''Bliss and Bigotry,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 27):
Is the president trying, yet again, to keep us afraid?
Does he know that the ''sacred'' institution of marriage was, for thousands of years, a financial and political arrangement?
Nothing is under attack here but love, commitment and the rights of a minority. I just can't get the ideals from that pesky Declaration of Independence out of my head.
