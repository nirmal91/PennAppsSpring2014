POLICE work is in the blood for Steffen A. Kaplan; in 1973 his mother, Dina Kalra, became one of the first female police officers assigned to patrol duty in New York. Mr. Kaplan, who is currently a photo editor with The New York Times News Service, began to photograph officers at work and got the chance to ride along with them all over the city. Some 30 of his police photos, which span the last 15 years, are on display in a show called ''Behind the Scenes: A Photographic Look Into the N.Y.P.D.,'' on view through Oct. 9 at the New York City Police Museum, at 100 Old Slip, near Water Street.
