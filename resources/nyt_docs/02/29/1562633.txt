NEVER mind what the sign says. Moe's Meat Market in NoLIta is not a butcher shop. It was then, and remains, an art workshop. But when ''The Godfather III'' (1990) was filmed downtown, the movie makers gave the store a name it had borne many years before, and although the cameras are long gone, the butcher sign remains.
The same holds for the booth in the front window of the Old Town Bar on East 18th Street, which was built for a 1993 Madonna video. And the new double doors at Columbia University's Havemeyer Hall were installed for a scene in last year's ''Mona Lisa Smile.''
''We've left so much,'' said Jane Musky, a New York-based production designer who has worked on ''Mona Lisa Smile,'' ''Maid in Manhattan'' and other films. After the electrical cords are rolled up after a shoot, many real-life proprietors decide to keep the change, whether it is wallpaper in a Gramercy Park foyer or major renovation in a Harlem church. Life imitates art, and the world of the movies edges its way into the cityscape.
