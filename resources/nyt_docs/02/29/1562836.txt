To the Sports Editor:
Thanks for the inspiring article, ''Blend at Bowdoin Is the Complete Player'' (Feb. 21) about the women's basketball team. I salute the players and their coach, and I salute the college from which I graduated 46 years ago for having the courage and conviction of becoming a men's and women's college 35 years ago after more than 170 years as an all-male institution.
