To the Editor:
Three cheers for Thomas L. Friedman's Feb. 26 column about outsourcing. It is good to see practical examples of what outsourced jobs mean. Sadly, little else we hear is useful or sensible.
The Democrats are making protectionist rumbles, and the Republicans are limiting their policy ideas to tax cuts, which won't finance anything.
But we still need more. Is there some middle ground between protection and completely untrammeled free markets? We can never forget that historically, American industrial capacity was built not under an untrammeled free market, but with protective tariffs.
