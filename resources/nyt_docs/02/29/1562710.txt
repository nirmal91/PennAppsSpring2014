Re ''Questions About a Market System for Mercury'' (news article, Feb. 24): The danger from mercury ''hot spots'' is a primary reason that the Environmental Protection Agency's own Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee raised concerns about the E.P.A.'s mercury proposal.
The committee urged Michael O. Leavitt, the E.P.A. administrator, to strengthen the proposal because it ''does not sufficiently protect our nation's children.'' I am a member of the committee, which includes doctors and health experts from academia, government and industry.
Mercury's harm to fetal and child development is well documented. It is alarming that the E.P.A. is delaying significant mercury reduction until 2018 or later. The technology and means exist to promptly reduce mercury's threat to our children. The E.P.A. should replace its proposal with one adequate to protect them.
