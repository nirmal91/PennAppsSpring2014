To the Editor:
While I agree with Thomas L. Friedman's position that the United States should not cavalierly erect protectionist trade walls (column, Feb. 26), he nevertheless overstates the benefits to the United States economy of outsourcing jobs.
After all, if a customer call center in Bangalore, India, uses computers from Compaq, software from Microsoft and phones from Lucent, why should we assume that a call center located in Bangor, Me., would not also use these same products?
