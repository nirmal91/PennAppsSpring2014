The Westchester Arts Council has published a new softcover book, ''Embracing the Past: The Elders Speak.'' The oral history book, which was developed as a resource for elementary and middle school educators, is the product of the council's Seniors Have a Role in Education program, conducted in partnership with the County Department of Senior Programs and Services, and Diversified Investment Advisors, a firm in Purchase. The program has encouraged older residents to share their experiences with students in Westchester schools to enhance history and social studies lessons. The stories and anecdotes in the book were transcribed under the direction of the council's theater artist and storyteller, Mara Mills, along with Jonathan Mann, the council's program director. The publication includes black-and-white portraits taken by Claire Yaffa. It also includes study guides and resources provided by three New Rochelle teachers, Glenda Bryant, Calvin Z. Heyward and Sally Roman. To obtain copies of the publication, call Ayeshah Wiltshire at the Arts Council, (914)428-4220, extension 241. The cost of the book is $15, including postage.
