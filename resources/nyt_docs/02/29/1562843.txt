Re ''State Pressures Suffolk to Build Jail'' [Feb. 22]: The Suffolk county executive, Steve Levy, and David Bishop, a county legislator, are right on target by opposing the building of a new jail in Suffolk. With a huge county deficit looming, fiscal restraint is the only appropriate course of action. The costs associated with building and staffing this new jail would be unacceptable to taxpayers who are already up in arms over out-of-control overtime costs associated with the existing correctional facilities.
Jail should be reserved for the most dangerous, violent and predatory offenders, and the county should be expanding current programs and creating new ones that divert nonviolent, misdemeanor inmate populations away from incarceration and into less costly treatment programs or other forms of community supervision.
As Mr. Bishop suggests in the article, the jail has become a dumping ground for the indigent mentally ill who were previously confined to state mental health institutions before the closing of many of these facilities over the last few decades. The county should move forward assertively with a mental health court to divert the significant number of mentally ill offenders who end up in jail for nonviolent misdemeanors that are the direct result of their disabilities.
