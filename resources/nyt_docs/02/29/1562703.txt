To the Editor:
I enjoyed "In the Name of Norton" (F.Y.I., Feb. 8) and letters to the editor (Feb. 15), on the subject of naming something in honor of Art Carney, who played the sewer worker Ed Norton on ''The Honeymooners.''
In 1989 at my urging, Howard Golden, then the Brooklyn borough president, proposed that the Gowanus Canal Pumping Station be renamed the Art Carney Pumping Station. ''The sewer workers are always forgotten (until there is a clogged catch basin or sewer) but deserve some recognition,'' he said.
The city's commissioner of environmental protection endorsedthe idea, but Mr. Carney declined to participate and so the renaming was not completed. After his death last year, it seems that the renaming would meet his family's concern. I hope it can proceed.
