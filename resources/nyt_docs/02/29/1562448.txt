To the Editor:
The first sentence of Paul Raeburn's review of David Goodstein's book ''Out of Gas'' (Feb. 8) troubled me: ''If all you knew about David Goodstein was the title of his book, you might imagine him to be one of those insufferably enthusiastic prophets of doom, the flannel-shirted, off-the-grid types who take too much pleasure in letting us know that the environment is crumbling all around us.''
While I understand Raeburn is essentially creating a rhetorical position he can then contradict, and perhaps even hoping to improve Goodstein's chance of drawing a readership in the process, I wonder why he has to do it by deriding people who are correctly, passionately worried about the state of the environment. Having just finished reading a biography of John Muir, I can say that it is only those ''flannel-shirted, off-the-grid types'' like Muir (or Thoreau before him) who gave us national parks, the environmental movement and great wisdom about the urgent need to preserve the natural world.
