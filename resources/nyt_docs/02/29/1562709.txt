A GAS-GUZZLER riddle: If the Rolls-Royce Phantom has an E.P.A. rating of 13 miles per gallon in town and 19 on the highway, and is subject to a $3,000 guzzler tax, how much is the tax on a Maybach, with an economy rating of 12/17?
Answer: absolutely nothing.
At a glance, it would seem that both cars would incur the penalty, since the combined fuel economy of each falls below the tax threshold of 21.5 m.p.g. (Warning: Do not attempt to compute this at home. The E.P.A. bases its calculations on a combined figure that is not a simple average of the city and highway numbers. Nor are those figures listed on the E.P.A.'s fuel economy Web site.)
The distinction is weight. The Maybachs are too heavy to be taxed.
An empty Rolls weighs 5,577 pounds. The short-wheelbase Maybach 57 weighs 6,050 pounds, and the longer 62 is 6,340. I.R.S. rules exempt passenger cars that weigh more than 6,000 pounds.
To verify the numbers, you might click www.fueleconomy.gov, but as of Friday the site listed the Maybach as being taxed -- an error, said David Deegan, an E.P.A. spokesman, who added that a correction would be made.
