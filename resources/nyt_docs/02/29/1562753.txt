Two gunmen opened fire at a Brooklyn nightclub early yesterday, wounding nine people, mostly in the legs and feet, the police said.
The shooting occurred shortly before 3 a.m. at Cabaret Ovation, at 860 Atlantic Avenue in Clinton Hill, injuring seven men and two women, who ranged in age from 18 to 25, according to the police. All nine were treated at area hospitals and were in stable condition, the police said.
One man was hit four times in the ankles and once in the buttock, according to police officials, who did not release the names of the victims or disclose a possible motive in the shooting. The two shooters fled, but detectives recovered shells and casings from two pistols at the club.
Hours before the shooting, the club featured its usual Friday night live jazz performance. Its Web site also advertises that it is available for art exhibitions, baby and bridal showers and private parties. Several private birthday parties were under way there when the shooting occurred, the police said. No one answered the telephone at the club yesterday.
