To the Editor:
I was delighted to read ''A Place in TV History'' (F.Y.I., Feb. 15), about the series ''The Jeffersons,'' on which I appeared as Lionel, the son, from 1975 to 1978.
You mentioned that the high-rise seen in the opening credits was 185 East 85th Street in Manhattan. I believe that the sequence also showed my ''parents,'' Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley, walking into a building in Santa Monica, Calif.
I've done a lot of things since the show ended. From 1986 to 1995 I worked mostly in Europe; among other things, I appeared in ''Carmen Jones'' at the Old Vic Theater in London. I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in psychology and doing volunteer work in East Harlem for Bailey House. But it sure was nice to know that the old gang is remembered.
