One problem plaguing the River Line, the New Jersey Transit train from Trenton to Camden that is at last scheduled to open on March 14, has been its inability to run full service past 10 p.m. Riders who might go to an evening entertainment event on the Camden waterfront, say, could get there by train but would not be able to return that way.
Last week, though, New Jersey Transit officials came up with a partial solution, one that had apparently been hidden since planning for the $800 million project began in the mid-1990's. The line will now operate until midnight Sunday through Friday and until 1:15 a.m. after Saturday night events, from Camden to a 375-car park-and-ride lot in Pennsauken. It will run its entire length to Trenton until midnight on Saturdays.
A transit spokeswoman, Janet Hines, said that the problem was an agreement with Conrail to share the tracks. Conrail insisted on exclusive late-night use, so light rail trains were not allowed to use most of the track after 10 p.m. But now Conrail says that it has no freight service on Saturday nights and that the part of the track from Camden to Pennsauken is not being used for freight at all.
''It is a big thing for us to have people access the Camden waterfront area, so we were happy to change that schedule,'' Ms. Hines said. Ridership projections for the line have been low -- about 2,800 a day over the 34-mile, 20-stop route -- even with the low price of $1.10 a ride. Ms. Hines did not say how much the agency expected the new times to add to those projections.
