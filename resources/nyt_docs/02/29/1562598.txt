Apparently it is no longer hip to be square. Hit Clips, the wildly popular line of music-playing key chains and personal microplayers by Tiger Electronics, has been redesigned for its fashionable fans, mainly girls 8 through 12. The corners of the original square chip players are rounded off to yield versions that resemble CD's roughly the size of a half dollar. Correspondingly circular personal players, equipped with a belt clip, an ear bud and a free disc, have been recast in new colors and designs, including flowers, smiley faces and kittens ($9.99; extra discs $4.99). The discs hold two minutes of music by artists like Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Madonna and Hilary Duff. And hey, parents -- batteries are included.
