To the Editor:
The illustration with Serge Schmemann's review of seven books on America's foreign policy (Jan. 25) shows a chess board in an illegal position. The game of chess can be played only if each player faces the board with a white square on the extreme right. In the illustration a black square is on the right, which means that the game cannot be played. At first I attributed this to ignorance. But I now see that the illustration was a subtle gloss on the review. It must mean that if the bedrock principle of any activity -- chess or war, football or diplomacy -- is set aside, then mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.
