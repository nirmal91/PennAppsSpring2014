To the Editor:
Like Emily Nussbaum [''The Evil Geniuses of Kiddie Schlock,'' Feb. 15], I was 7 years old when ''H. R. Pufnstuf'' first graced Saturday morning airwaves. Seven, traditionally, is the age of reason, so even at that tender age one could recognize the show as a cheap ''Wizard of Oz'' knockoff, right down to the talking trees and wicked witch who wants something the child has -- in this case, a magic flute. Long after the show's heyday, I discovered that the title character was supposed to be a dragon; Pufnstuf always looked to me like a giant mushroom. For many in our generation, it was an early exercise in ''guilty pleasure'' entertainment.
I don't share Ms. Nussbaum's dismissal of the follow-up series ''Lidsville'' as ''deeply strange.'' Strange it certainly was, but creatively it was a vast improvement over ''Pufnstuf.'' It was basically the same wizardless ''Wizard of Oz'' premise, only this time the boy finds himself in a land where all the characters are hats. Charles Nelson Reilly delightfully played the comic villain, an evil magician whose name escapes me (1971 wasn't yesterday). The late Billie Hayes, the former Witchiepoo, appeared in ''Lidsville'' as a genie called Weenie; that I remember.
The subsequent Kroft series I missed. On the outset of puberty, I confined my Saturday morning viewing to ''The Bugs Bunny Show.'' Kiddie shows come and go, but you can never beat the classics.

SID AND MARTY KROFFT  Correction:  March 21, 2004, Sunday  A letter on Feb. 29 about the television producers Sid and Marty Krofft referred incorrectly to Billie Hayes, who appeared in their shows ''H. R. Pufnstuf'' and ''Lidsville.'' She is alive, in Los Angeles, where she makes personal appearances and is president of an animal rescue group.
