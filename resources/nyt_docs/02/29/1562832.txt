To the Sports Editor:
In defending the Yankees' acquisition of Alex Rodriguez, Harvey Schiller argues (''Yanks' Savvy Move Should Be Blessing For All of Baseball,'' Feb. 22) that ''in a perfect world, there would be more A-Rods available'' for everyone. He points to the fact that our youngsters are being lulled away from the baseball field by video games and television.
Here in Michigan, we are ecstatic because the Tigers have finally acquired a player people have heard of, Ivan Rodriguez. The Yankees light their cigars with Ivan Rodriguezes. Detroit cannot afford to put together a competitive team when there is an increasingly unipolar talent pool.
Schiller's argument is tangential because player talent is relative. In a world of A-Rods, there would still be only a handful of A-plus-Rods, and the Yankees would gobble them up.
