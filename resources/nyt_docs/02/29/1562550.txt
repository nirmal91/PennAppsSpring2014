To the Editor:
Regarding Frank Rich's column [''My Hero, Janet Jackson,'' Feb. 15], I would just like to add that Janet Jackson got her idea from Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was in a film with Laurence Olivier called ''The Prince and the Showgirl.'' Marilyn was quite fed up with the way Olivier always stole the scene. At a 10 a.m. press conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, Marilyn appeared in a black cocktail dress with spaghetti string straps. One was designed to break. At an appropriate moment during the proceedings, she pushed herself into that strap, and it broke. Immediately all attention was off Olivier and on Marilyn. Janet should at least give credit where credit is due.
