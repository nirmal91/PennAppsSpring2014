Re ''Study Finds Most Health Care Workers Do Not Get Flu Vaccines'' (news article, Feb. 26):
I was upset to learn that such a low percentage of health care workers are immunized.
I am a college student. As soon as winter hit, the idea of getting a flu shot was thrown at me left and right. It baffles me that health care officials would make such a big deal about the public's taking part in immunization when the people hired to help the public get healthy and stay healthy aren't even participating. People you think are helping you or your loved ones could actually be contributing to your poor health.
