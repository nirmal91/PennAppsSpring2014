Calculating Health Risks
Q. Which increases health risks more, smoking or obesity?
A. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is still the greater risk, by a big margin. But the rising rate of obesity in the United States is narrowing the gap for the general population.
In terms of overall mortality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that tobacco smoking is responsible for more than 440,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The estimate for obesity ranges from 280,000 to 325,000 deaths a year, according to Michael Thun, the chief epidemiologist for the cancer society.
''However,'' he added, ''obesity costs more in annual medical expenditures -- an estimated $75 billion in 2003 -- because of the long and expensive treatment for several of its complications.''
About 27 percent of Americans are classified as obese, and the share has risen by 50 percent in the last 10 years.
Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with some of the same diseases as smoking, including heart disease and illnesses that are specifically linked to excess weight, like Type 2 diabetes, which was long known as adult-onset diabetes.
