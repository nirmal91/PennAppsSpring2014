To the Editor:
President Bush, in a TV interview on NBC on Sunday, defended his decision to go to war, saying it was a war of ''necessity'' rather than a war of ''choice'' (front page, Feb. 9).
The president is correct. The fact that weapons of mass destruction have not been found nor are likely to be found is immaterial. Our presence in Iraq has already begun to show results, with Libya scrapping its nuclear program. At the same time, Iran and Syria understand that this president's goal is to democratize the Middle East in order to eliminate the breeding ground for terrorists.
Despotic regimes know full well that they could be the next target should another terrorist attack strike the United States mainland. That is why there has not been one since 9/11. Sometimes in life, the end justifies the means. This is one of those times.
