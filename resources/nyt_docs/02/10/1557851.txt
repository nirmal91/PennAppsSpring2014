Three members of a group that tried to enter Afghanistan to fight against American forces after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were sentenced in federal court in Portland. Judge Robert E. Jones of Federal District Court sentenced Maher Hawash, 39, a former engineer at Intel, to seven years in prison for conspiring to aid the Taliban. Two brothers, Ahmed Bilal, 26, and Muhammad Bilal, 24, were sentenced to 10 years and 8 years, respectively, for conspiracy and other crimes. Three other members of the group have already been sentenced, and a fourth remains a fugitive.
