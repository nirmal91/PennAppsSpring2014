To the Editor:
Apparently President Bush is in no hurry to improve his ability to see dangers that exist and make decisions as a war president. Delaying the release of the Iraq prewar intelligence commissions report (''In Rare Talk Show Interview, Bush Defends Decision on War,'' news article, Feb. 8) means that he won't be able benefit from better intelligence to deal with threats pre-emptively.
So until the report is released next year, he can make war-related decisions and still have pre-emptive war as an option, without having better intelligence to work with.
