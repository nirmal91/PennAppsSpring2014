To the Editor:
I'm glad David Brooks is chinking away at John Forbes Kerry's honesty armor this early in the race (''Kerry's Special Friends,'' column, Feb. 7). It exposes the damaging effect of the media preoccupation with declaring a winner so early.
It also shows that liberal voters are headed down the path of superficiality blazed by conservative knee jerks. How can voting for a candidate based solely on his already having won elsewhere be construed otherwise?
What will Democrats do, come late October, if (when?) Mr. Kerry is exposed as just another blue-blood rich guy looking out for the rest of us only when the cameras are rolling? What will Democrats do if (when?) they find that only Howard Dean and Dennis J. Kucinich, long since browbeaten out of the race, are what they say they are?
John Kerry may actually be a principled man, but we liberals are being herded into choosing him in an unprincipled way. It will show, and it will haunt us.
