The Market Place column in Business Day on Saturday, about a court decision related to the proposed acquisition of the MONY Group by AXA Financial, misstated the headquarters location of AXA Financial. It is New York; France is the base of its parent, AXA.
The related picture caption misstated the title of an AXA official, Claude Bébéar. He is chairman of the supervisory board of the parent company, not chairman of AXA Financial.
