Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed a bill yesterday that would have required the state to subsidize continued health care coverage for out-of-work entertainment industry employees. The bill would have required that $2.5 million in state funds be made available to help employees of theaters, circuses, and the music, film and recording industries, among others, according to a memorandum released by Mr. Pataki's press office. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, said last night that it was being amended to address criticisms and that it would be resubmitted today. ''We've got to keep New York livable for people in the entertainment business, and this was crucial,'' he said.
