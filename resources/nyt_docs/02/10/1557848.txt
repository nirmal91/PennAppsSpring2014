The execution of a convicted killer was called off Monday night less than four hours before it was scheduled to take place after state officials lost a court battle.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit blocked the execution of the inmate, Kevin Cooper, and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal by the state.
The appeals court said Mr. Cooper, who was convicted in 1985 of killing four people, should be given another chance to present evidence. His lawyers suggested in court papers that blood samples used prosecutors by should be tested for tampering.
