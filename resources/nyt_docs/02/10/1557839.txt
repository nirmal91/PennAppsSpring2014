The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimangagain, insisted that a diet of garlic, olive oil and lemon juice helps fend off the effects of AIDS, repeating a message denounced last year by a leading national medical journal as ''ill-considered advice'' not backed up by scientific data. Ms. Tshabalala-Msimang scolded reporters at a parliamentary briefing for their earlier ridicule of her prescription, saying that the three ingredients are ''absolutely critical'' to boosting the immune system and that as little as a monthly teaspoon of olive oil would reap benefits. Like President Thabo Mbeki, she has cast doubt on what most scientists call an irrefutable link between the HIV virus and AIDS. Estimates vary, but at least one in 10 South Africans is H.I.V.-positive.
