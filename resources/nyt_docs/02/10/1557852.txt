The State Board of Elections voted to postpone the state's primary to July 20 from May 4, and the Democratic Party said it would instead hold county caucuses on April 17 to vote on presidential candidates. Under the May primary schedule, filing for candidates would have begun Monday, but the state is waiting for federal judges to approve district maps drawn by the Legislature. State courts declared previous maps unconstitutional, and in 2002 the state used maps drawn up by a judge.
