To the Editor:
You are kidding yourself if you think that the views offered in ''Mr. Bush's Version'' (editorial, Feb. 9) speak more to the ''average American'' than the president did in his interview on ''Meet the Press.''
What I heard President Bush say was, ''Congress saw the same intelligence I had, and they looked at exactly what I looked at, and they made an informed judgment'' to vote to support the war. And he reminded us that the United Nations had the same opinion of Iraq's capabilities and cooperation.
Intelligence is an imprecise business. Saddam Hussein got caught bluffing. And the world is now a better place.
