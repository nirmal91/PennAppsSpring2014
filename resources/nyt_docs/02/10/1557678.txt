Symptoms of depression, even when mild, put postmenopausal women at much higher risk for cardiovascular disease, according to a new study.
The researchers, who reported their work yesterday in The Archives of Internal Medicine, said their conclusions were based on data from the Women's Health Initiative and 93,676 postmenopausal participants. It is the largest such group ever studied.
All the women were given psychological screening. After following their health for an average of four years, the researchers found that depressed postmenopausal women were 50 percent more likely to die of cardiovascular disease.
The women in the study were described as generally healthy. Women with histories of severe depression were not included.
The results support theories that treating depression with drugs can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. ''That, of course, is the prime question,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
The relationship between the two illnesses is unclear, however. Either condition might lead to the other, the study said.
Over all, the study found, almost 16 percent of the women had symptoms of depression. Other studies link depression and heart disease in men and women, Dr. Wassertheil-Smoller said, but it is unclear whether her study's results extend to men.
