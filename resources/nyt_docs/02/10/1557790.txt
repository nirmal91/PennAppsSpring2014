To the Editor:
''Mr. Bush's Version'' (editorial, Feb. 9) rightly points out the ''fuzziness and inconsistency'' of President Bush's comments on ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday. If, according to the president, the United States must deal with potential threats from rogue nations anywhere before such a threat becomes imminent, and if we tell the offending rogue nation to disarm or face the consequences and are then required to launch a pre-emptive war to keep our word, then another Bush term might well lead to a nightmare of additional pre-emptive wars.
