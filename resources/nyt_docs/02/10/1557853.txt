The State Supreme Court ruled that Gov. Mark Sanford may keep his commission in the Air Force Reserve, to which he was appointed in 2002, a year before he became governor. Mr. Sanford, a Republican, said that if he were called to service abroad, ''that goes with the territory.'' In a statement, he said he was ''a husband and a father first, a governor second and a reservist third.'' He is a logistical officer in the Medical Service Corps. A Greenville man had filed suit, citing a provision in the state's Constitution that prohibits governors from holding any other office or commission, except in the militia. The court said ''militia'' encompassed the Air Force Reserve.
