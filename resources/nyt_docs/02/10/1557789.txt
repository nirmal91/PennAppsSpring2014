To the Editor:
Re ''President Offers Defense on Iraq and the Economy'' (front page, Feb. 9):
A defense? He should be apologizing. Were there weapons of mass destruction? Was Iraq involved with the 9/11 attacks? Did Al Qaeda operate in Iraq? Did Iraq have a viable nuclear program? No, though all were justifications he presented to the American people for his war.
Now we face a record deficit and irresponsible budget gimmickry. When will the lies end?
