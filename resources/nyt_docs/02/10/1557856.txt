The police asked the public last night for information about the rapes of a teenager in Brooklyn and a 32-year-old woman in Queens.
Both sexual attacks happened late last week, a Police Department spokesman said.
On Thursday, a 13-year old girl was pulled from an elevator in a building near Mother Gaston Boulevard and Liberty Avenue in Brooklyn. The attacker led the girl to a top-floor landing in the building, where he raped her, the police said.
In a separate attack a day later, a man in his late 20's approached a 32-year old woman with a knife at 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Grand Avenue and Seabury Street in Elmhurst. The man dragged the victim between two parked cars and raped her there, the police said.
