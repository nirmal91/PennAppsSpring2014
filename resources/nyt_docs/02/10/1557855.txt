A preliminary federal investigation into the deaths of 11 harbor porpoises that washed ashore on the Puget Sound last May ended with scientists unable to determine whether a Navy sonar exercise played a role. Six of the porpoises were too badly decomposed to determine a cause of death, and three died of infections, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The other two suffered head injuries, which could have been caused by collisions with a ship.
