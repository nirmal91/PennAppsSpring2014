To the Editor:
In ''Mr. Bush's Version'' (editorial, Feb. 9), you say, ''The only clarity in the president's vision appears to be his own perfect sense of self-justification.''
Increasingly, President Bush appears to be displaying the characteristics of a fundamentalist. His faith in what he knows to be true is so strong that he rejects any facts that happen to prove him wrong.
