Two men were shot by federal agents yesterday in a raid on a suspected counterfeiting operation in East Harlem, the Secret Service said. The agents were trying to serve one of the men with a search and arrest warrant, accusing them of producing counterfeit bills, when the shooting occurred around 6 a.m. at 70 East 115th Street, officials said. One suspect was treated at a hospital and released; the other was still hospitalized. Investigators recovered a handgun from the scene, said Steven H. Carey, the special agent in charge for the Secret Service, the agency that investigates counterfeiting. Neighbors said the men were brothers in their 20's who shared a sixth-floor apartment. Mr. Carey declined to identify the men or the circumstances that prompted the shooting.
