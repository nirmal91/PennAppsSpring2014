To the Editor:
Re ''Mr. Bush's Version'' (editorial, Feb. 9): No matter what the president might have said short of an apology, I suspect that you would have found his response self-serving.
While time will tell, I believe that most Americans will be more trusting of President Bush's resolve to act in the best interest of America. Anyone who was in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, should recognize that decisive action was demanded.
I, for one, trust that Mr. Bush acted solely on his best judgment. We've taken out lots of bad guys who needed removal.
Continued examination of intelligence mistakes is warranted, but attacks on our president's character will be rejected by voters this fall.
