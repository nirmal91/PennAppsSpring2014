A man convicted of killing his grandfather was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 37 1/2 years to life in prison. The man, Martin Lewis, 34, of Manhattan, had been found guilty of killing his grandfather, David Barnes, 74, and stealing thousands of dollars from him. Prosecutors said Mr. Lewis cut up Mr. Barnes's body, which was never found. Last month, a jury found Mr. Lewis guilty of murder, grand larceny and 83 counts of forgery.
