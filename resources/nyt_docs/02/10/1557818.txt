To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''Benefit of Bed Rest Is Largely a Wives' Tale'' (Feb 3): I was put on bed rest for approximately half of my pregnancy. I fully believe that it enabled me to carry a healthy baby girl to 38 weeks.
One fresh spring morning toward the end of my pregnancy, my husband helped me walk the one block to Central Park. As I sat and watched runners go by, it was not envy that I felt. On my park bench, I felt relaxed and peaceful.
Take advantage of bed rest. It is the only time in life that you are allowed to slow down and let others do things for you.
