A lawyer disbarred last year for questionable handling of a charity's funds was arrested yesterday and charged with embezzlement and diversion of $1.3 million. In May, Charles D. Conway, 55, a lawyer in Toms River, N.J., was disbarred after an audit of the Rita and Harry Greenberger Foundation, of which he was a trustee, uncovered an unexplained overdraft. Yesterday, F.B.I. and I.R.S. agents arrested Mr. Conway at his Beach Haven, Fla., home on a 33-count indictment. The indictment said Mr. Conway has told authorities that the funds were loans. His lawyer did not return a call for comment.
