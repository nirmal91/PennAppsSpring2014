To the Editor:
Re ''Man Who Killed the Mad Cow Has Questions of His Own'' (Feb. 3): As a veterinarian working for the Ministry of Agriculture in England in the 90's, and having diagnosed bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in hundreds of animals, I know from experience that a vast majority of infected cows can (and should) be detected before becoming recumbent.
The animals become too sick to walk only in the last stages of the disease. Several weeks or months may elapse between the time an animal first shows symptoms and it becomes recumbent. In that time it may continue to be milked and even give birth.
