To the Editor:
Re ''Hormone Use After Cancer Can Be Risky, Study Says'' (Feb. 3): The article refers to ''treating'' menopause, suggesting that it is a disease rather than a natural process. Or does society's penchant for valuing comfort at any cost influence scientific inquiry?
Certainly, debilitating problems might require help. But tolerating small discomforts rather than undergoing surgery or taking drugs might prove safer in the long run.
