To the Editor:
The lesson I draw from David Brooks's Feb. 7 column is that we should prefer the Bush administration's catering to special interests over Senator John Kerry's because President Bush has no qualms about lining his friends' pockets with taxpayer money.
I hope that Mr. Brooks will understand if I continue to favor Mr. Kerry's brand of pork, which costs me a few dollars a year, over Mr. Bush's brand, which my children will have to take out a second mortgage to pay for.
