To the Editor:
As a Jewish student in the 10th grade at Trinity School, I can honestly say that I have never experienced, nor have I ever heard, any anti-Semitic or in any way offensive slurs used by Trinity students (news article, Feb. 7).
When I first applied to Trinity two years ago, I was a bit concerned with the religious aspect of the school. But soon after beginning my freshman year, I learned that my concerns were unfounded. Not only was I warmly accepted into the Trinity community, but I also felt that an active effort to eliminate bigotry and racism of all kinds was constantly maintained, including annual events like Diversity Morning, as well as various assemblies.
I trust the judgment of my headmaster and my school's administration, and I believe that their investigation should be given ample time to analyze the incident that occurred. Trinity School is a wonderful place to learn, and a warm and beautiful community in which students of all races and religions can bond together.
