The Alcan aluminum and packaging group reported net fourth-quarter earnings of $143 million, up from $26 million a year earlier. Operating earnings grew by 9 percent. Alcan, based in Montreal, said that the benefits of higher metal prices and improved productivity had been offset by the weak dollar and rising energy and pension costs. The results do not include any contribution from Pechiney, the recently acquired French aluminum producer.
