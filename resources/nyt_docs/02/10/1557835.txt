ST Assembly Test Services, a semiconductor company based in Singapore, is close to a deal to buy ChipPAC, a rival, for about $1.5 billion in stock, a nearly 50 percent premium as the chip industry continues a rebound that began late last year, executives close to the talks said.
A deal could be announced as early as today, they said.
ST Assembly, which tests and packages semiconductors for companies, will offer $11.50 to $12 a share for ChipPAC, which is based in Fremont, Calif., the executives said. That represents a premium of about 50 percent to ChipPAC's closing price of $7.90 yesterday.
The premium underscores the strong recovery in demand for chips, which shrank drastically after the technology bubble burst. The American depository receipts of ST Assembly closed yesterday at $13.34, up 1 cent.
Under terms of the transaction, shareholders of ChipPAC will own about 50 percent of the combined company, which will have combined annual sales of more than $1 billion starting this year, the executives said.
The combined company will be run by Lay Koon Tan, the chief executive of ST Assembly. The chief executive of ChipPac, Dennis P. McKenna, will join the board.
In late January, ChipPAC reported that it swung to a profit in the fourth quarter of 2003.
The company's net income was $3.3 million, or 3 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $7 million, or 7 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 38.5 percent, to $128.4 million from $92.7 million.
For 2004, the company said in its earnings release, ''we again believe that market demand across a broad usage of electronic products will continue to drive volume increases.''
