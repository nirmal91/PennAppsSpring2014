Part of a wall collapsed and fell onto a 10-year old boy on a street in the Bronx yesterday, the police said. His injuries, however, were not life threatening, a police spokesman said.
The boy, whose name was not released by the police, received what police said might have been a skull fracture, when the bricks from a wall of the building at 2720 Grand Concourse, near East Kingsbridge Road, fell on him. A 4-year-old also received minor injuries, the police said.
Witnesses began calling to report the falling bricks about 4 p.m. A small section of the wall near the roof of the multi-story brick building had crumbled and fallen onto the sidewalk below.
The boy was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, the police spokesman said.
A nursing administrator at St. Barnabas said last night that the boy had been transferred to New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, which gave no further details on his condition. The Department of Buildings could not be reached for comment last night.
