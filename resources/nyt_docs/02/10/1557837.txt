President Thabo Mbeki set April 14 for general elections, which are widely expected to give his African National Congress continued control of Parliament and most provincial legislatures. The congress holds about two-thirds of the seats in Parliament; retaining that control in April would all but ensure that the body would re-elect Mr. Mbeki to a second five-year term as president.
