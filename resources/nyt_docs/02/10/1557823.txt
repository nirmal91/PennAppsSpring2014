To the Editor:
Re the Personal Health column ''Often, Time Beats Therapy for Treating Grief'' (Jan. 27): My husband died about four months ago, and so far I have avoided support groups, bereavement groups and pill therapy. I'll mourn the way I brush my teeth: my own way.
Some of us believe that when it's our turn to walk the world, we can and will do so, on our own.
