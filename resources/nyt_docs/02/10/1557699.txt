To the Editor:
Re ''Can the North Rise Again?'' and ''One State, Two State, Red State, Blue State'' (Week in Review, Feb. 8):
Red states and blue states would become moot if the Constitution were amended to abolish or change the Electoral College. Because each state's electoral votes equal the total number of senators and representatives in that state, states with low population have more clout.
Here in Vermont, each elector represents about 203,000 people; in California, 616,000. It's the counting of senators in the totals that skews the results.
A more fair way would be to amend the Constitution to assign electoral votes by the number of representatives only. Except for some anomalies like Delaware, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming, each electoral vote would represent between 550,000 and 700,000 people.
If this system had been in place in the 2000 election, the electoral vote would have reflected the popular vote and Al Gore would have won.
