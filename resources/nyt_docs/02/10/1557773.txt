A Sharp Increase In On-Time Flights
Domestic flights arrived on time 82 percent of the time last year, a sharp improvement over the 72.6 percent on-time performance in 2000, according to the year-end Air Travel Consumer Report by the United States Transportation Department.
A flight is considered to be on time if it arrives at the gate no more than 15 minutes after its scheduled time.
Among the individual flights that were chronically late in December 2003, according to the report, was Atlantic Coast Airlines Flight 7839 from Burlington, Vt., to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago; the flight was late every time.
Major airlines' chronically late flights included: United Airlines Flight 759 from Philadelphia to O'Hare (late 90 percent of the time, for an average of 54 minutes a flight); Continental Airlines Flight 1412 from Newark to Myrtle Beach, S.C. (87.5 percent, 31 minutes); American Airlines Flight 425 from Cleveland to O'Hare (85.2 percent, 55 minutes); US Airways Flight 1470 from Philadelphia to San Juan, P.R. (83.9 percent, 60 minutes); and American Flight 1415 from O'Hare to Minneapolis-St. Paul (83.3 percent, 53 minutes).
Happy Birthday To the Boeing 747
The jetliner that helped shrink the globe, the Boeing 747, was 35 years old yesterday. The plane was first flown in 1969 and carried its first commercial passengers in 1970. Since then, the Boeing Company said it had delivered 1,341 of the super-jumbo planes, which in various versions have carried 3.6 billion passengers.
A Boeing spokeswoman, Leslie Nichols, said yesterday that Boeing was studying development of a new model, the 747 Advanced, which the company first talked about at the Paris Air Show last June. The plane, if built, would seat as many as 400 to 500 passengers and would offer improved fuel efficiency and noise control. The airplane would enter service toward the end of the decade, Boeing said.
Ms. Nichols said Boeing was currently in ''product development discussions'' with potential customers for the plane, which would probably offer be capable of carrying a few more passengers than the approximately 400-seat capacity of the most recent model, the 747-400. Airbus is currently marketing its super-jumbo A-380 aircraft, which can carry 550 to 700 passengers.
The Boeing Advanced, which has been called a stretch version of the 747, ''fills its own niche'' and is not seen as a challenge to the A-380, Ms. Nichols said.
Growing Opposition To Computer Screening
Travel managers from major corporations are voicing growing opposition to the process being followed for the deployment of CAPPS II, the government's proposed new system for using computer databases to prescreen airline passengers.
Fully 95 percent of travel managers surveyed last week by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives found CAPPS II ''unacceptable in its current form,'' the professional group said. The shortcomings identified by travel managers included the lack of an appeals process for removing names incorrectly placed on a list of banned passengers, a lack of published guidelines concerning possible arrests at the airport for offenses not related to terrorism, and inadequate policies for providing fare refunds for passengers who miss flights as a result of being detained without charges.
