To the Editor:
The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, states that ''it is impossible'' to have all Americans covered by health insurance (news article, Feb. 7). In fact, it would be impossible if we were to follow the incremental strategies that have dominated the health care reform process in the past decade.
But that process has been broadened to include consideration of the single-payer model. Numerous studies have shown that a publicly administered, single insurance system would not only cover everyone but also provide comprehensive benefits. And it would provide economic mechanisms that would address the nation's greatest concern about health care: ensuring affordability for each individual and for society as a whole.
We should no longer allow our politicians and policy makers to dismiss the most effective and affordable model of reform simply because of concerns about political feasibility.
