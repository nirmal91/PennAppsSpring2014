The police arrested five men and two women on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deaths of 19 people, mostly Chinese immigrants, who drowned in tidal surges last week while digging for shellfish in northwest England. The police have said they believe that some victims were illegal immigrants working for a trafficking gang. A bill was introduced in Parliament that would crack down on work-gang masters.
