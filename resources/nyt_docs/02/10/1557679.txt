Hospital emergency rooms routinely mishandle patients who arrive with acute, potentially fatal allergies to food, researchers reported yesterday.
Writing in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the researchers said doctors often failed to follow established guidelines for treating people suffering from allergic reactions to foods like nuts and shellfish. Patients often are not given the proper medicine, epinephrine, the study found. And they regularly are not given prescriptions or referrals to allergy specialists.
The study, led by Sunday Clark of Massachusetts General Hospital, was based on a review of 678 charts for patients treated at 21 emergency rooms. The researchers found that over all 16 percent of the patients were given epinephrine.
The figure was not much different for patients with the severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Of those, the study found, 24 percent were given epinephrine. The rest were given drugs like antihistamines and steroids.
The study also found that an ambulance was called for 18 percent of the patients and that only 16 percent were given prescriptions for self-injecting epinephrine devices to carry.
A co-author of the study, Dr. Carlos A. Camargo, said emergency room doctors needed better training about epinephrine.
''I think the main reason is a lack of clarity about when this medicine should be used,'' Dr. Camargo wrote in an e-mail message. ''Epinephrine would have little benefit in very mild cases, but the more severe cases would definitely benefit.''
