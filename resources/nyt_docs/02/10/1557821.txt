To the Editor:
Re ''Man Who Killed the Mad Cow Has Questions'': It is disappointing that the article did not receive front-page coverage. Dave Louthan's firsthand knowledge that animals can walk in the early stages of mad cow disease raises questions about the Food and Drug Administration's new rules on cattle too sick to walk.
And while the issue of meat contamination has centered on advanced deboning machines, Mr. Louthan's description of band saws spraying spinal tissue all over carcasses seems convincing.
