The health risks of too little sleep are well established, but how about too much sleep? A new study finds that adults who sleep more than seven and a half hours a day may also be at higher risk.
After surveying the health and sleep habits of more than 100,000 people for an average of almost 10 years, Japanese researchers concluded that the lowest mortality risk occurred in people who slept seven hours a day.
The study, led by Dr. Akiko Tamakoshi of the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, appears in the current issue of the journal Sleep.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Daniel F. Kripke, a sleep expert at the University of California at San Diego, said that ''although these conclusions might surprise clinicians,'' they were in keeping with earlier studies.
The study found that people who reported sleeping eight hours a night had a higher mortality rate than those who reported sleeping seven hours. The longer the subjects slept, the higher their risk.
Indeed, Dr. Kripke wrote, people who said they slept more than seven and a half hours appeared to suffer worse health effects than those who said they slept for six and a half hours. People who reported sleeping for less than four and a half hours had big increases in their mortality risk.
The researchers said it was unclear how sleep and mortality risk were linked. It may be that underlying health problems cause some people to oversleep.
''When presented with evidence that there is increased mortality risk associated with 8, 9 or 10 hours sleep,'' Dr. Kripke wrote, ''many with long sleep wish to know if they should voluntarily restrict their sleep. This is an important unanswered question.''
