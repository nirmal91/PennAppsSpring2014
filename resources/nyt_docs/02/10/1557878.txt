A Florida man has been arrested and accused of traveling to New Jersey to have sex with under-age girls. The man, Dennis P. DelPriore, 41, of Daytona Beach, was arrested on Friday in a Mount Laurel hotel room, where the authorities said they found a stun gun, sex toys and Viagra. They said that Mr. DelPriore had met a 13-year-old girl in an online chat room and had arranged to see her Friday. On Thursday, he traveled to New Jersey and later followed the girl's school bus, officials of the United States Attorney's Office said. During a search of Mr. DelPriore's home in Florida, a list of girls, all of whom appeared to be under age, was discovered, a United States prosecutor said. Mr. DelPriore was charged with crossing state lines to engage in sex with a minor. His lawyer did not return a call for comment.
