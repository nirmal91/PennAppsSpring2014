Re ''Anti-Semitic Slurs Mar Game at Top Private School'' (news article, Feb. 7):
As the mother of a Jewish athlete who played for an elite private school, I was disturbed by this disgusting display and wonder what re-education plan Trinity had in mind for the few dozen bystanders, especially parents, who apparently, in public, exhibited no discomfort or admonition of the anti-Semitic taunts.
