To the Editor:
In his ''Meet the Press'' interview, President Bush said: ''I believe it is essential that when we see a threat we deal with those threats before they become imminent. It's too late if they become imminent'' (excerpts, Feb. 9).
Is this a new Bush doctrine? This Bush doctrine would have us justify pre-emptive war on the basis of pre-imminent threats. Is there a country we couldn't attack with this policy?
