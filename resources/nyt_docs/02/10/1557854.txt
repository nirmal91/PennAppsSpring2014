Kathleen O'Toole, a former state secretary of public safety, has been appointed commissioner of the Boston Police Department. Ms. O'Toole, the first woman to hold the position, will succeed Paul Evans, who left for a job with the British government. Ms. O'Toole, who spent seven years on the Boston police force, runs a consulting firm. She takes the job as the Boston police face scrutiny about rioting after the Super Bowl and about security preparations for the Democratic convention in July.
