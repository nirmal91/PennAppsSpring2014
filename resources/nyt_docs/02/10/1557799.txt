To the Editor:
Re ''President Offers Defense on Iraq and the Economy'' (front page, Feb. 9): Tim Russert's so-called interview with George W. Bush was yet another instance of excessive media deference to the president. Mr. Russert allowed Mr. Bush to deliver lengthy, scripted monologues -- unresponsive to the questions asked.
Where are the media that will recognize Mr. Bush as a candidate running for elected office and treat him as they do other politicians -- pointing out inconsistencies in stated positions, discrepancies with regard to past actions and statements clearly at variance with the truth?
