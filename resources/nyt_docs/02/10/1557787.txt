The Mets will add two inexpensive pitchers to their staff when they sign Ricky Bottalico and James Baldwin to minor league contracts this week, according to a club official. Bottalico, a right-handed reliever, appeared in two games for the Arizona Diamondbacks last year and spent the rest of the season in the minor leagues. Baldwin, another right-hander, was 0-1 with a 5.40 earned run average in 10 games for the Minnesota Twins.
Bottalico, 34, will compete for a spot in the bullpen. He had his best seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies when he saved 34 games in 1996 and in 1997. Baldwin, 32, will be a candidate for the fifth spot in the rotation or for a long relief role. He won 14 games for the Chicago White Sox in 2000.
