The outcome seemed logical enough. A person tears knee cartilage -- often playing sports -- and has surgery. Then the risk of arthritis increases.
But it may be the other way around. Early-stage arthritis may explain, in some cases, why the cartilage tore in the first place, researchers report in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism.
''A degenerative tear may be regarded as an early signal of susceptibility to osteoarthritic disease,'' wrote the researchers, led by Dr. Martin Englund of Lund University Hospital in Sweden. Classifying arthritis as a secondary disorder is misleading, they said. The researchers studied 170 people who had had surgery an average of 20 years earlier for injuries to the knee cartilage known as the meniscus.
When the researchers examined the patients, they found that 55 percent had arthritis in the affected knee. But in many cases, the patients also had arthritis in the other knee and in the hands -- evidence that the injury had not led to the disease in the injured knee.
The researchers also found that patients who developed arthritis of the hand at an early age were more likely to have severe knee injuries. Inherited characteristics and environment may combine to increase arthritis risk, the researchers said.
A meniscus may tear, they added, because undetected arthritis puts stress on the entire joint.
