A front-page article on Thursday about the decision by George J. Tenet, director of central intelligence, to publicly defend American intelligence on Iraq referred incorrectly to the reason given by Henry A. Kissinger for his resignation from a commission looking into the Sept. 11 attacks, a move that White House officials said influenced their approach to screening candidates for a commission to investigate intelligence operations under Mr. Tenet. (The error also appeared in a front-page article on Dec. 14, 2002.) Mr. Kissinger said he decided to step down because resolving potential conflicts of interest would have meant liquidating his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, a step that he said would have unduly delayed the commission's work. He did not say he stepped down to avoid releasing a list of clients of his firm.
