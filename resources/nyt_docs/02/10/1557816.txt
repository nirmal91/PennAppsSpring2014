To the Editor:
Re ''Adventure or Inquiry? Two Visions of Cosmic Destiny'' (Feb. 3): The article asks, ''Are we the lords of creation, or pond scum?''
It is too soon to tell. Though we evolved from simpler forms of life, we are somewhere between these two extremes and may yet become more significant if we survive -- which mostly means if we do not kill ourselves off.
For now, we are too young and endangered a species for meaningful judgment.
