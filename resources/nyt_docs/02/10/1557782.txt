The board of PeopleSoft on Monday rejected the latest offer from Oracle to acquire the company, saying that even at $9.4 billion, or $26 a share, the bid -- made last Wednesday -- undervalued the company, a producer of business applications software. PeopleSoft's announcement came as federal regulators appeared to be nearing a decision whether or not to file a lawsuit to try to block a deal on antitrust grounds.
''The board believes that PeopleSoft has a better plan for stockholders,'' said Craig Conway, PeopleSoft's chief executive, in a statement. ''Oracle's offer does not begin to reflect the company's real value.''
PeopleSoft executives said the shares were currently trading at the low end of their historical valuation largely because of the uncertainty created by Oracle's takeover attempt. On Monday, PeopleSoft's stock fell 53 cents, closing at $22.22.
Although the Justice Department's decision deadline is several weeks away, staff investigators are expected to issue an internal recommendation as early as Tuesday. That will be sent to R. Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, who will issue a final decision by March 12.
It is somewhat rare that the assistant attorney general issues a decision different from the one his staff recommends, according to antitrust lawyers. Only Mr. Pate's final decision will be officially announced, Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said.
If the Justice Department allows the offer to proceed, the PeopleSoft board's rejection of it -- at a level 33 percent above the offer of $19.50 a share made in June -- could stir up enough stockholder anger for Oracle to prevail in a proxy fight for control of the board. PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., has moved up its annual shareholder meeting to March 25. Oracle, of Redwood Shores, Calif., recently submitted five candidates to run at that meting to replace existing board members.
On Monday, PeopleSoft urged its shareholders to retain their stock, arguing that the Oracle bid was likely to be blocked by antitrust regulators in both the United States and Europe. The European Commission, the year-round executive arm of the European Union, is reviewing the possible combination and is expected to announce its decision sometime after the Justice Department makes its announcement.
The antitrust review being conducted by the Justice Department is complex because Oracle and PeopleSoft overlap in some, but not all segments of the business software market, so the degree of competition varies among groups of products. Federal investigators must review the impact on each market segment -- for software for human resources management, enterprise resource planning and inventory management -- to understand the nature of competition in each.
Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said PeopleSoft shareholders seemed in no hurry to tender their shares because there is a growing perception that the Justice Department will move to block the deal.
Donald Luskin, a PeopleSoft shareholder who is chief investment officer at Trend Macroanalytics, an economics consulting firm, agreed, saying that shareholders like him are waiting as long as possible in the event a better offer comes along.
But Oracle executives urged that PeopleSoft stockholders accept the sweetened bid, describing their company as in precarious financial shape. Jim Finn, an Oracle spokesman, said, ''Given PeopleSoft's uncertain future as a stand-alone company and the fact that, for the first quarter, PeopleSoft guided analysts below the consensus estimates, Oracle believes that its offer is full and generous.''
''Since PeopleSoft's current directors persist in their refusal even to discuss the offer with Oracle,'' Mr. Finn said in a statement. ''PeopleSoft stockholders can act in their own best interests by tendering their shares and voting to elect the slate of five independent directors to the PeopleSoft board.''
On Jan. 29, Mr. Conway told financial analysts that the company would probably report 17 cents to 18 cents a share in net earnings this quarter, a figure at the low end of the analyst consensus at the time of 18 cents. But PeopleSoft executives also said the company had met or exceeded its earnings guidance in 16 of the last 17 quarters.
Tad Piper, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, said he thought Oracle's actions in the last eight months had negatively affected PeopleSoft's business. ''I think there's some truth to saying the uncertainty hanging over PeopleSoft is having an impact on the company,'' he said, ''particularly in the education and government sectors.''
During the talk with analysts in January, Mr. Conway said sales to those sectors were roughly 12 percent of total licensing revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003, down from as high as 25 percent in the past.
PeopleSoft executives have repeatedly accused Oracle of using the takeover bid to confuse the market and to damage PeopleSoft's business. ''Don't underestimate the additional value PeopleSoft can create once the disruption from Oracle's hostile activities has ended,'' Mr. Conway said.
TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  February 11, 2004, Wednesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about PeopleSoft's rejection of the latest takeover offer from Oracle misstated the name of an economics consulting firm whose chief investment officer said many stockholders were waiting as long as possible to tender their PeopleSoft shares in case a better offer came along. It is Trend Macrolytics, not Trend Macroanalytics.
