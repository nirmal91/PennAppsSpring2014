The Commission for the Indemnity of Looting Victims, a government panel, said France should pay remaining compensation requests of $154 million to the families of Jews whose property was looted in the Nazi occupation of World War II. A government report in 2000 estimated that $1.5 billion in assets were seized from Jews in the occupation and that 90 percent had been repaid. The commission has received 15,696 requests since it was created in 1999 and has recommended compensation for 9,717 requests.
