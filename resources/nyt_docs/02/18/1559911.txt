The Daytona 500 on NBC on Sunday was the second-most watched, attracting an average of 17.8 million viewers. The viewership was exceeded only by the race two years ago, which drew 18.7 million on the second Sunday of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
NBC's Nielsen rating of 10.6 for the race was 8 percent higher than Fox's 9.8 last year, and it ranks behind only the 10.9 rating in 2002. Each rating point equals 1.08 million television households.
