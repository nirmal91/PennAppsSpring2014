To the Editor:
In ''Our Dinners With André'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 15), Ruth Reichl reveals that Lutèce in its later years did not deserve four stars but that they were awarded for ''sentimental'' reasons. As such, I and other readers were made the victims of her desire to compliment its chef at the expense of people who may have come many miles to dine there and concluded that a certain chicken dish in fact tasted like a high-priced Swanson's chicken pot pie.
