To the Editor:
Re ''How America Doesn't Vote'' (editorial, Feb. 15):
The maintenance of voting rolls should be done as precisely as scientists and engineers calculate the Mars landing projects. The fact that it isn't done that well is a testimony to our collective inattention to details about how bureaucrats and politicians operate. It's also about graft and corruption.
It behooves all of us to protect access to the polling place and our precious right to vote. I shudder at the prospect of a series of ''Floridas'' come November.
