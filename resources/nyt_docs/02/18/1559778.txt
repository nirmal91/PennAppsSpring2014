Less was more. Too much more.
And so, the Egyptian tombs of Raemkai and Perneb at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, temporarily on view for the first time in nine decades without the protective glass that obscured them, will be closed to visitors one month early starting tomorrow and will not reopen until May.
In the weeks since the restored and reconfigured tombs were unveiled to the public on Jan. 29, lines of visitors -- 11,500 to Perneb's and 13,000 to Raemkai's -- have waited as long as two hours to see the interiors of the tombs.
''We never anticipated that the response would be so huge,'' said Harold Holzer, the Met's vice president for marketing and communications. The crush of visitors near the 4,000-year-old limestone carvings ''has put the humidity at unacceptable limits,'' he said. ''Our primary responsibility is to preserve the works of art.''
No visitors have attempted to harm the reliefs, Mr. Holzer said. But despite posted signs asking visitors to be careful, people, he said, ''are pushing into the tombs, and there is too much potential to jostle the walls.''
''There have been some very close calls,'' he said.
New 11-foot-tall glass panels from Wernberg-KÃ¶blitz, Germany, could not be installed until mid-March. So the museum decided to open the unprotected tombs to visitors before the installation.
Late yesterday afternoon, the 40 people in line were informed that the waiting time was an hour and a half. Some visitors were stunned to learn that the tombs would be closed a month early. ''It's sad that other people won't be getting this opportunity,'' said Bonita Ganot, a Manhattan psychologist who had waited 25 minutes.
''Not my reaction,'' said her husband, Harvey, with a laugh. ''I'll be only too happy to lord it over others who missed it.''
