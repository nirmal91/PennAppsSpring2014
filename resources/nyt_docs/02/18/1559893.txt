Nine mailroom employees at Brooks Air Force Base near San Antonio were quarantined and 150 other workers were evacuated after an envelope was found to contain a white powder. None of the employees reported illness, and officials said that preliminary tests did not indicate that the powder was a poison or a germ. The envelope, which contained a paycheck, was being routed on base and was not sent through the United States Postal Service, the authorities said.
