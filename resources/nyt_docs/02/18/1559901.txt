An obituary yesterday about Paul Ilyinsky, a member of the Romanov family who became mayor of Palm Beach, misstated his relationship to two Russian czars. He was a great-grandson of Alexander II (not a great-great-grandson) and a first cousin of Nicholas II once removed (not a second cousin). Because of an editing error, the obituary referred incorrectly to his opponent in his first race for mayor. Yvelyne de Marcellus Marix is a woman.
