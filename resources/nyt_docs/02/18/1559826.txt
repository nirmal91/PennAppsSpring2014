To the Editor:
In ''Meet the Press'' (column, Feb. 15), Thomas L. Friedman imagines an eloquent statement from John Kerry warning terrorists not to expect him to cut and run from Iraq.
Such a strong stance would be welcome, especially considering the opposite message Senator Kerry sent to terrorists with his vote against financing the continuing war and occupation in Iraq.
It would also be refreshing to see a candidate of any stripe admit that his opponent isn't wrong all the time. Today's political climate, though, doesn't seem to allow any mercy.
