To the Editor:
Re ''Just What Killed the Diet Doctor, and What Keeps the Issue Alive?'' (news article, Feb. 11):
I suggest that Atkins critics pick up a copy of Dr. Robert C. Atkins's latest book and enlighten themselves about the ''fat facts'' and the overall Atkins diet.
Not all fats cause heart disease. Trans fats do, and Dr. Atkins's diet stays away from the trans fats while promoting a controlled-carbohydrate diet rich in natural fats and proteins.
On Dr. Atkins's diet, I lost 35 pounds, my blood pressure normalized, my HDL (''good'' cholesterol) skyrocketed and I stopped taking my cholesterol-lowering drug.
Heart disease is caused by many factors, like aging, gender, genetics, obesity and smoking. There are thousands of Atkins followers who have improved their health and quality of life and who serve as testimony to the effectiveness of the Atkins diet.
