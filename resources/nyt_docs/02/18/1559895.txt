A soldier and the estate of another soldier are suing the sheriff's deputy who shot the soldiers two years ago when he mistook Green Beret training exercises for criminal activity. The suit also names the sheriff's office. Sheriff Lane Carter said that the deputy, Randall Butler, killed First Lt. Tallas Tomeny and wounded Sgt. Stephen Phelps in February 2002 near Fort Bragg after Deputy Butler stopped their pickup truck and found a bag with a disassembled machine gun in it. The sheriff said the deputy fired to protect himself when the soldiers came at him and went for the gun. A lawyer for the soldiers said there had been no provocation for deadly force. The State Bureau of Investigation examined the matter, and no charges were filed.
