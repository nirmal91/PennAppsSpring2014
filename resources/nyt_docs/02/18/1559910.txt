The former mayor of New Hanover Township was sentenced yesterday to six months in federal prison for witness tampering in the investigation of an $11,500 sidewalk repair contract. The former mayor, Patrick G. Malloy, 69, who walks with a cane, was also sentenced to six months of house arrest by Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. of Federal District Court, who cited Mr. Malloy's health issues. Mr. Malloy admitted last year that he had told a witness to lie to a grand jury investigating a contract given to his brother in 1999. Along with James J. Nash, the former treasurer of the town and the school board, Mr. Malloy was found to have lied about bids to steer at least 30 township contracts to his friends and relatives over a 17-year period.
