The Internet service provider America Online touched on a serious problem when it announced plans to provide its customers with software that detects and disables ''spyware'' -- covert programs that can secretly record a user's movements through the Internet for use by marketers and identity thieves. The screening programs, which are already available from at least one other Internet provider, Earthlink, are an important tool in the campaign to protect users from intrusive marketers and information thieves. Finishing the job will require action from Congress, which is just waking up to the spyware problem.
Congress recently passed a law aimed at stemming the rising tide of electronic junk mail. But that law will do nothing about the covert programs -- variously known as adware, spyware and snoopware -- that secretly invade our computers as we download file-sharing programs or move from one Web site to the next. Experienced users who run detection software commonly find their machines infested with dozens of covert programs. The most sinister are illegally installed ''keystroke recorders,'' which allow remote users to capture secure passwords, Social Security numbers and other sensitive data, making victims especially vulnerable to fraud and information theft.
Covert programs like these are roughly analogous to telephone wiretaps, which are clearly illegal. Congress will miss the point if it regulates specific varieties of spyware, only to watch the programs mutate into forms that evade a narrowly tailored law.
A better solution, as proposed recently by the Center for Democracy and Technology, is to develop privacy standards that protect computer users from all programs that covertly collect information that rightfully belongs to the user. A good start would be to require all such programs to announce themselves clearly and define their functions, allowing the users to reject software that strikes them as intrusive.
