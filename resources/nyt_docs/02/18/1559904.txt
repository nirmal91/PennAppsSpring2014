An article in Business Day on Monday about Conrad M. Black's relationship with the board of Hollinger International referred incorrectly to the outcome of a deal in which the company sold two newspapers in Washington State -- The Skagit Valley Argus and The Journal of the Island of San Juan -- for 50 cents each to Horizon Publications, a separate company in which Lord Black held a large stake. Horizon said it lost $12,000 after it later sold both papers, not $12,000 on the sale of The Journal alone.
