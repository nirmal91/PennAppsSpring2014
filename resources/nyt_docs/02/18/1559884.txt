More than a year after buying Inktomi, a company that makes software for searching the Internet, Yahoo will start using a modified version of that software for its Web searches, starting today. Until now, Yahoo's Web searches were provided by a rival, Google. Yahoo said its Web searching would be fresher and more relevant than Google's. Google said that it had added nearly one billion pages to its Web index for a total of 4.28 billion pages. Yahoo declined to say how many pages are in its index. Yahoo's move is the first shot in what it hopes will be an assault on Google in several search-related areas.
