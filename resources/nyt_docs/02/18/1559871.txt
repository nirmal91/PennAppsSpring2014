In his first public address since President Chandrika Kumaratunga dissolved Parliament, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe accused the president of stifling an economic recovery and jeopardizing a cease-fire with Tamil rebels. His speech was carried on several private television channels, but not by the state-run media, which are controlled by the president.
