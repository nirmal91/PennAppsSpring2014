To the Editor:
Re ''How America Doesn't Vote'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Feb. 15):
Given the divisiveness at home and abroad, coupled with the Bush administration's declining credibility and dig-in-their-heels neocons, I shudder to think what might happen in our streets -- or Baghdad's -- if in November we have anything remotely like the vote-count fiasco we had last time.
More than ever, we need a voter registration and vote counting system that we all can trust.
Remember, our president got into office by highly questionable vote counts.
