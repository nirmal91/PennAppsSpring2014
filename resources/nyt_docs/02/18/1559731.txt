Gradually, the restaurants in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle are starting to open. The first of the chefs who is ready is THOMAS KELLER , left, an owner of PER SE . Bookings at Per Se are going fast, though lunch reservations are a last-minute possibility. Per Se has a $125 five-course menu, a $135 nine-course vegetable menu and a $150 nine-course tasting menu. Having closed the FRENCH LAUNDRY  in Yountville, Calif., for renovations, Mr. Keller expects to be in his restaurant full time until May.
MASA TAKAYAMA 's restaurants, MASA  and BAR MASA  are to open Tuesday. Tasting menus at Masa, with seasonal imported fish that are often exotic, will start at $300. Reservations are accepted only during the first week of every month for the following month. Bar Masa, a sushi bar and lounge, does not take reservations.
Refusing to allow LA GRENOUILLE , a restaurant grande dame if ever there was one, to become a memory like its near-contemporary Lutèce and the soon-to-close CÔTE BASQUE , CHARLES MASSON , the owner, plans a face-lift and then some. The surgery is to begin March 21, and the restaurant is to reopen by April 5 with a new facade and entry into a bar area reconfigured as a more relaxed setting for drinks and light food throughout the day.
BARBUTO , with an earthy Italian menu, has opened at 775 Washington Street (West 12th Street) in the Industria Superstudio, a complex of photo studios. JONATHAN WAXMAN  is the executive chef, and LYNN McNEELY  is the chef de cuisine.
RICHARD FARNABE , who was the chef at the short-lived Aigo on the Upper East Side, is now the corporate chef for the MILOS  restaurants in New York and Montreal. The group is opening a restaurant in Athens, in time for the Summer Olympics.
At JEAN-LUC , 507 Columbus Avenue (85th Street), JULIO QUISBERT , who was second in command, is now the executive chef, replacing ÉRIC LE  DILY , who has left.
