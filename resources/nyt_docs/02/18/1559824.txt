To the Editor:
Re ''Afghan Women, Still in Chains'' (column, Feb. 14):
Unlike Nicholas D. Kristof, I am not proud of American actions in Afghanistan.
Once again, we seduced and abandoned that vulnerable country. We led the Afghan people on with false promises, had our way with them and went on to bigger quarry.
We have always treated Afghanistan the way that country treats its women.
