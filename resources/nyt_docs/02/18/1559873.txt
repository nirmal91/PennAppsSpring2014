A Liberal member of Parliament, John Bryden, quit the party, adding to the swelling effects of a scandal over government misspending of public money. ''I've lost confidence in the prime minister and I've lost confidence in the Liberal Party,'' he said. The announcement came as a poll indicated that public support for the party had fallen to 35 percent, from 48 percent a month ago.
