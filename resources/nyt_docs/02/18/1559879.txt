A 65-year-old woman in County Mayo continued sharing a bed with her sister's body for up to a year after the sister died, according to a court inquest into why the death was not reported. The woman, Mary Ellen Lyons, said she could not remember when Agnes, 70, died. Her decomposed body was found in August by a doctor making a house call. The sisters had become so reclusive that they communicated with their brother, Michael, 74, who lives in the same house, by passing notes under the bedroom door. ''There is no way that Michael would open the door of a woman's room,'' a neighbor told the inquest. ''They were from a different era.''
