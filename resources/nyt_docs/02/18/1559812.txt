With a number of acquisitions being negotiated, commercial real estate brokers say they are optimistic that sales on Long Island will continue to increase this year, following the pattern of 2003, when several large properties changed hands at significantly rising prices.
''The investment trend appears to be continuing into 2004,'' said Bruce C. Nelson, a vice president in the investment properties group in the Woodbury office of CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company.
There is ''approximately $125 million of investment-grade real estate under contract or being offered for sale,'' he said, ''including a $35 million portfolio of three properties that is in contract and two separate office-building transactions that are under way in Nassau for a combined price of approximately $40 million.''
While saying that confidentiality agreements prevented him from identifying the buildings, Mr. Nelson said the three-property portfolio included office and retail space totaling 226,000 square feet, and the two office-building sales totaled 280,000 square feet.
Last year, Long Island buildings containing three million square feet of office space sold for a total of $470 million -- an increase from 2002, when 1.8 million square feet sold for a total of $252 million. Last year's sales included about 10 office properties ranging from 109,000 square feet to more than a million square feet.
In September, a Melville office building sold for $150 a square foot and raised the bar on prices for subsequent sales, Mr. Nelson said. Previously, well-situated office buildings had sold for about $130 a foot. After the Melville sale, three buildings sold above $170 a square foot.
Mr. Nelson said that while some people were buying for their own use, most bought ''as an investment and hiring companies to manage them.''
Industrial sales have also been increasing, with purchases by users and investors, said Charles Tabone, manager of the industrial division at the Long Island office of Newmark &amp; Company, the real estate services provider. ''The driving force is the plentiful supply of funding, because of low interest rates, and those in leased spaces are now looking to buy,'' Mr. Tabone said.
Accounting for a large part of 2003 office-building sales was the purchase of the 15-story, 1.1 million-square-foot EAB Plaza office complex in Uniondale for $185,670,000 by Galaxy LI Associates, a joint venture of two Manhattan property companies, the Moinian Group and C&amp;K Properties. The seller was a joint venture of the DeMatteis Organization and ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.
Joseph Moinian, the Moinian Group's chief executive, said Galaxy was planning to build a 340,000-square-foot office tower just west of EAB Plaza, and was looking to invest in more property on Long Island.
Brokers say that one of the most interesting sales last year was of a 14-year-old, 143,000-square-foot building in Melville that was bought for $21.5 million by Steel Equities of Bethpage from One Beacon Insurance Group. Aside from EAB Plaza, which sold for $173 a square foot in part because of amenities including a skating pond, the Melville building, at $150 a square foot, ''was a high-water mark at the time it occurred,'' Mr. Nelson said. The building's location, at the intersection of the Long Island Expressway and Route 110, was the key to its high price, he said.
Last month, Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a Long Island-based real estate investment trust, sold a 21-year-old, 109,000-square-foot six-story office building in Mineola for $18.5 million -- $170 a square foot -- to nearby Winthrop University Hospital, which will use it for administrative offices.
Scott Rechler, Reckson's chief executive, explained, ''We want to focus on the Class A office market and we are selling our assets that are not Class A or in prime locations,'' adding, ''We are planning to buy more than $100 million worth of deals on Long Island.''
Reckson now owns 27 Long Island office buildings totaling 4.1 million square feet. In September, in a $315 million transaction, four members of the Rechler family resigned from the real estate trust -- which had held 20 million square feet of office and industrial space in the New York area -- to acquire its Long Island industrial portfolio of 95 buildings totaling 5.9 million square feet.
According to Newmark's data, in 2003, not including the sale of the Reckson industrial portfolio, a total of 4,060,925 square feet of Long Island industrial properties, with a total value of $184,550,603, were sold, compared with 3,101,223 square feet, with a value of $171,621,077, in 2002.
