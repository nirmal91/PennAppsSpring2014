A former police officer at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who admitted trying to videotape an 11-year-old girl as she took a shower in her home was sentenced yesterday in Queens Criminal Court to three years' probation, the Queens district attorney's office said. The officer, Russell Bass, 42, of Hempstead, pleaded guilty last month to attempted unlawful surveillance. Mr. Bass was arrested after the girl told the police that she had noticed a hand holding a video camera outside a partly opened bathroom window in her home in Jamaica. Mr. Bass, who had worked for the Port Authority police for 15 years, has since resigned. Judge Douglas S. Wong ordered Mr. Bass to undergo two years of sex offender therapy as part of his probation.
