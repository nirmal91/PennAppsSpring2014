To the Editor:
Re ''Southern Baptists Bring New York Their Gospel'' (front page, Feb. 15): You quote a Southern Baptist missionary, Scott Rourk, as saying about New York, ''I don't know if I thought of it as Sin City, but I knew it wasn't the closest place to God.''
I beg to differ. Any city where people from all over the world can live together and, for the most part, tolerate, respect and even appreciate one another's beliefs and traditions is about as close to the divine as we've ever gotten on this planet.
