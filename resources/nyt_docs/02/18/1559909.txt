In a widely watched challenge to the power of homeowner associations over issues of speech, a State Superior Court judge ruled yesterday that such associations may restrict political signs and enforce other rules that would be unconstitutional if adopted by a town or other local government. Prof. Frank Askin of the Rutgers Law School in Newark, who represented a group of East Windsor residents challenging their homeowners association, said they would appeal the decision. The ruling, by Judge Neil H. Shuster, dismissed most of the claims against the governing association in Twin Rivers, a development of 10,000 people. The lawsuit claimed that the association's board had banned signs on front lawns to squelch political opposition. But Judge Shuster ruled that the residents were bound by the contracts they signed when they moved in and that the association was not subject to constitutional restraints.
