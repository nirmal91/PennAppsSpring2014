To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 15) calls on John Kerry to declare that ''a Kerry presidency will pay any price and bear any burden to try to build a decent Iraqi regime in the heart of the Arab world.''
Perhaps I should remind Mr. Friedman that Senator Kerry wants to be president of the United States, not president of Iraq or of the Arab League.
