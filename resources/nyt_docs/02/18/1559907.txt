Officers impounded 16 buses in Chinatown yesterday after conducting surprise inspections on 19, the police said. More than 130 summonses were issued, for violations including parking and safety infractions, a police spokesman said. A law enforcement official described yesterday's checks as ''safety stops'' but noted that they coincided with a continuing investigation into violence and intimidation among more than half a dozen companies that run discount bus trips from Chinatown to cities like Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and Atlantic City. The police did not identify the companies that owned the impounded buses. Violent incidents have been linked to the business over the years, and last week, a driver for one of the bus companies and another man were stabbed on East Broadway, police officials said.
