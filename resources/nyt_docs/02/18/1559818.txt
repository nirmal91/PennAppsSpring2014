Re ''Eat and Be Merry; Tomorrow 2 Classics Die'' (news article, Feb. 13):
Lutèce and André Soltner: I have so many memories. Dialing desperately for reservations the minute the book opened 30 days in advance; my embarrassment during my first meal there as a teenager, facing down the all-French menu, ordering pamplemousse as a first course and being distraught when half a grapefruit arrived.
But my favorite Lutèce memory is from the 1980's, when I was on the original liquid protein diet.
Most restaurants would perfunctorily make me a broth from my protein powder.
But at Lutèce, the captain seemed charmed to accept my protein package, and when the table's food came out, mine came under a silver dome along with everyone else's. The broth was in a beautiful bowl under an intricate lattice of chives with a festive parsley garnish. And the restaurant refused to charge me. A class act.
