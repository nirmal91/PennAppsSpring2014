The World Health Organization last week recommended changing two of the three strains of virus to be used in next season's influenza vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere.
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to adopt the changes on Thursday, when a two-day meeting on the issue concludes.
Officials from both agencies said they could not recall a time when the American recommendations differed substantially from those made by the World Health Organization.
Influenza vaccine comprises three strains. The selection is based on findings from the W.H.O.'s influenza monitoring network, which gathers information about the strains of the virus circulating around the globe.
Most influenza vaccines are prepared in hens' eggs. The choice has to be made at this time of year, vaccine manufacturers say, because it takes months to adapt the virus for growth in the eggs and to buy the tens of millions of eggs needed to produce a supply for large populations.
Next season's vaccines for the United States are expected to include the Fujian strain that has caused most of this season's flu cases here and in Europe. The Fujian strain will replace the strain known as A/Moscow.
Next season's vaccine will also substitute the B/Shanghai strain for the B/Hong Kong strain. The new vaccine will still include the A/New Caledonia strain.
When the W.H.O. and the F.D.A. held their influenza vaccine meetings last year, experts knew that the Fujian strain had begun infecting people. But committee members said there was not enough information or time to include the Fujian strain in the vaccines given this season in the Northern Hemisphere. Influenza outbreaks tend to occur in the colder months of the year, which are reversed in the two hemispheres.
