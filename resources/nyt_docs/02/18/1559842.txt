A Vermont judge ruled yesterday that Howard Dean could not use a blanket assertion of ''executive privilege'' to shield from public view more than half of the papers he assembled over 11 years as governor.
Under the ruling, Dr. Dean or the state will have to list any documents they want to keep secret and state a reason.
Dr. Dean's records, in 145 boxes kept at a state warehouse outside the capital, Montpelier, became a topic of debate before this year's primary voting. Democratic rivals criticized the former governor for sealing the papers and then telling reporters, in what he later described as a joke, that he did so to avoid possible embarrassment ''in any future endeavors.'' The ruling by Judge Alan W. Cook of Superior Court came in a suit filed by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group.
