To the Editor:
Re ''How America Doesn't Vote'' (editorial, Feb. 15):
Florida's voters are nervous. Our elected officials, including the president, promised the money and leadership to fix our election systems. Neither has materialized.
We need federal money and federal guidance on issues like voting machine security.
As you have pointed out in your ''Making Votes Count'' series, the Election Assistance Commission faces an uphill fight for financing. States are counting on the commission to ensure that voters are never again erroneously purged from registration lists, turned away from the polls and disenfranchised by old voting machines.
It is not too late to instill voter confidence in our fall elections. Delivering all the promised money is an essential step.
