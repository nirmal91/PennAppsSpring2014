To the Editor:
Some additional principles for voter purges should be added to the list in ''How America Doesn't Vote'' (editorial, Feb. 15).
First, anyone purged should be contacted immediately both by phone and by mail.
Second, no one should be purged fewer than six months before a federal election. This way, people can check to make sure that they are still on the rolls within six months of the next election and seek to have their names restored if they were wrongfully removed.
