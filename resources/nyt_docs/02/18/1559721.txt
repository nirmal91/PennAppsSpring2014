Wasabi, a potent root that is native to Japan, has gone from being just a sushi condiment to an ingredient that is used in mashed potatoes and even ice cream. Now the leaves of the plant are also starting to show up in stores.
The flat, crinkled, dark green leaves, which are three inches or so across, have a pretty heart shape and are worth considering as a garnish, to add a new dimension to a salad or to shred into a broth. Their flavor echoes the cleansing forcefulness of the root, but without the sinus-clearing fire.
Packages of six leaves are $3.50 to $5 at Agata &amp; Valentina, Dean &amp; DeLuca and Whole Foods markets.
