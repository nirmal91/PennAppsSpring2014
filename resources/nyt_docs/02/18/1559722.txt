Oysters were once abundant in the Raritan and Hudson River estuaries, stretching from Sandy Hook, N.J. to Ossining, N.Y. An environmental group, the New York-New Jersey Baykeeper, hopes to restore oyster beds to some of this habitat. To help, Bahrs Landing, a restaurant in Highlands, N.J., is canning an oyster stew for sale in New York and New Jersey, with 10 percent of the sales going to Baykeeper, whose executive director, Andrew Willner, is at right. (The oysters in Bahr's stew are not local, because there are none.) Mixed with a can of milk and heated to a simmer, it is a fine winter warmer. I melted a pat of butter and added a dash of paprika to each portion. Bahr's stew is sold at the restaurant and in Foodtown and A.&amp;P. supermarkets, at $2.99 for a 16-ounce can.
