Cisco Systems said yesterday that it planned to announce today a video telephone that it says is easy to use and will help drive down the cost of videoconferencing. Called Cisco Video Telephony, the system lets users easily add video to phone calls made over Cisco Internet-based telephone systems. The company is hoping the system will gain widespread adoption because of its price: about $200 a person. Videoconferencing systems can cost many thousands to deploy and are often difficult for individual users to operate.
