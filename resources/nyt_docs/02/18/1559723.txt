Prosciutto and melon may be a classic pairing, but at this time of year, fresh melon does not live up to its half of the bargain. Instead, consider narrow wedges of French glac√© melon, which resembles dried fruit but is fragrant, lush and moist, with a rich concentration of melon flavor. It is a sublime foil not only for prosciutto but also for other cured hams like serrano and spicy coppa. The melon is also excellent with cheese or in a fruit salad. It is $6.99 a pound at Fairway markets, where it is called dried melon.
