Re ''Independent Living Is Exposing Elderly to Eviction Threat'' (front page, Feb. 15):
Millions of Americans lose their homes each year from inability to pay the rent, gentrification-triggered rent increases, utility shutoffs, code enforcement and many other causes.
The trauma of eviction leads to family stress and breakup, middle-of-the-year school transfers and outright homelessness. And of course it is low-income and minority families that are disproportionately affected.
Tenants rarely have legal representation in housing court, and most overburdened housing court proceedings provide little semblance of due process or fair outcomes. Yet we don't even have basic data collection systems, nationally or locally, to monitor the extent of the problem, reasons for the evictions, who is affected and what happens to those evicted.
Creating stable, secure, affordable housing is essential for healthy communities. The elderly must be protected. But so must the nonelderly.
