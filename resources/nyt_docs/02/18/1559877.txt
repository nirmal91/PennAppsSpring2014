President Vladimir V. Putin took to sea aboard a nuclear submarine in a carefully orchestrated visit on the eve of presidential elections to observe one of the country's largest military exercises in years. Russian news agencies, including the official Itar-Tass, reported that two ballistic missiles aboard another submarine misfired because of a glitch in satellite communications. The Navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir I. Kuroyedov, later denied that there were any malfunctions. The exercise, under way since last month, involves Russia's strategic nuclear forces and includes test flights of ballistic missiles and strategic bombers, military commanders have said.
