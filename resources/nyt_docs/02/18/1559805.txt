To the Editor:
Re ''How America Doesn't Vote'' (editorial, Feb. 15):
Until the system of maintaining state voting lists has clear standards and is transparent and nonpartisan, we should monitor our national elections to ensure that corruption is not a problem. I'd gladly contribute to offset whatever extra cost the states would incur to be sure that results like those in Florida in 2000 do not happen again.
