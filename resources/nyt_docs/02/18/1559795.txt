A grand jury declined yesterday to indict a New York City police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man on the roof of a Brooklyn housing project last month, officials said.
Officials have said that Brooklyn prosecutors asked the jury to consider charging the officer, Richard S. Neri Jr., with criminally negligent homicide and manslaughter in the shooting, which Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said appeared to be unjustified.
Indictments of police officers in such cases are rare, but some legal experts had suggested that this case might be exceptional. The victim, Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, who was black, was not carrying a weapon or committing a crime. And no words were exchanged between Mr. Stansbury and Officer Neri, who is white.
