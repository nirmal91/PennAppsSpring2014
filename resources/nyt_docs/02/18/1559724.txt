Like macaroni and cheese, butterscotch pudding has gone from homey comfort food to the big time on dessert menus. At Patroon, it is swirled with crème fraîche in a parfait glass. The Four Seasons restaurant unmolds it like a flan. It is classically done with whipped cream at Kitchen 82 and Kitchen 22.
At David Burke &amp; Donatella, it is turned into a rich panna cotta layered with curry-spiced caramel, below. For the panna cotta, Mr. Burke's secret ingredient is ordinary butterscotch candies: crush 8 ounces, mix with vanilla-bean scrapings and stir into a heavy pot with 1 3/4 cups of heavy cream. Simmer until the candy melts. Whisk half a packet of unflavored gelatin with 2 more cups of cream, add to the pot, remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Strain the pudding, pour it into stemmed glasses or ramekins and chill 6 hours, until set.
