To the Editor:
I cannot let the snarky comments attributed to the restaurant consultants in ''Eat and Be Merry; Tomorrow 2 Classics Die'' (news article, Feb. 13) stand without rebuttal.
Gage &amp; Tollner and Lut√®ce were not ''bad'' restaurants or even ''dinosaurs.'' Their staff and management did their best for a very long time and with distinction through the toughest economic climate that this city has endured in generations.
These two restaurants were part of what makes New York so special, and they will be missed.
