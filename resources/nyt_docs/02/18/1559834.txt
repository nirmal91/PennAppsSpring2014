Reflecting strong growth in global electronics demand, Singapore's nonoil domestic exports rose 2.7 percent in January compared with January 2003. Leading the growth were shipments of telecommunications equipment and semiconductors to Australia. Economists said the figures were all the more impressive because the long Chinese New Year holiday fell in January this year, reducing the number of business days. Demand for exports was so strong that many factories kept non-Chinese employees working to fill orders, they said.
