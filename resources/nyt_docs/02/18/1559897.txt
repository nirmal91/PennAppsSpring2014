An article on Thursday about the possibility that Bush administration officials might accept the ouster of Haiti's president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and his democratic government misstated the year he was restored to power by the Clinton administration and American troops after his ouster in a military coup in 1991. It was 1994, not 1992.
