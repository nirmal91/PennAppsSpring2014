Red Lobster, part of Darden Restaurants, is considering changing the agency handling the creative part of its account as part of its efforts to try reversing a sharp decline in sales. Billings are estimated at $80 million to $100 million.
A spokeswoman for Red Lobster in Orlando, Fla., Wendy Spirduso, confirmed reports of the review in AdAge.com and Adweek.com. Of 16 agencies considered, Ms. Spirduso said, 3 have been named finalists: Euro RSCG Tatham Partners in Chicago, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas, which has handled the assignment for six years; Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, which creates campaigns for another Darden unit, Olive Garden; and the Richards Group in Dallas, which has worked for several restaurant chains.
A decision in the review is expected in 60 to 90 days.
