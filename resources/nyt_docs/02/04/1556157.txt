To the Editor:
Re ''Commission to Decide Itself on Depth of Its Investigation'' (news article, Feb. 3):
Clearly, no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq.
Because antiwar protesters were contesting the fact of these weapons before the war, it appeared to many that the president was lying to the country to enact his personal agenda.
To clear his reputation (or not), it is imperative that the members of the commission investigating the American intelligence failure be independent from the president and other political pressures.
