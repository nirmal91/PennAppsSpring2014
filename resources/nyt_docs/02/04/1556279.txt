Five new centers for students who have been suspended from school will open today, the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joel I. Klein, announced yesterday. The community groups that will run the centers with the Department of Education include Phoenix House in Brooklyn, Boys and Girls Harbor in Manhattan and Phipps Community Development Corporation in the Bronx. Officials said the groups would be paid $200,000 per center this semester, a cost that does not include salaries for teachers and other staff members. Each center will have room for as many as 60 students who have been suspended for up to 90 days, and will provide instruction and enrichment programs, officials said.
