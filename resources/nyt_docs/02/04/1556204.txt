A leading global biotechnology company, Serono, said its profit rose 37 percent in the fourth quarter, to $111.6 million, from the period in 2002. Fourth-quarter sales rose 17 percent. The company said sales growth was led by its reproductive health division and totaled $519 million. For the year, Serono said profit rose 22 percent, to $390 million, and sales rose by a greater-than-expected 31 percent, but its share price declined more than 2 percent because of a cautious forecast for 2004. Andrew Fellows, an analyst for Pictet &amp; Cie,  said that investors were disappointed because Serono did not appear to be coming up with enough new products and that growth prospects for its rivals in the United States appeared to be better.
