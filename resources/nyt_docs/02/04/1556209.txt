The Elan Corporation, the drug maker, said that antegren, a treatment for autoimmune disorders that it was developing in partnership with Biogen Idec, would begin trials for rheumatoid arthritis in the first half of this year. The drug, which works by preventing selected immune cells from moving into tissue where they cause inflammation, completed the final stage of human trials for Crohn's disease last week, and is in the final stage of testing for multiple sclerosis.
