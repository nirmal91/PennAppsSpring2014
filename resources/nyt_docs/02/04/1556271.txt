The British and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties began a formal review of the the so-called Good Friday Agreement of 1998 that created the Catholic-Protestant government that has been suspended since October 2002. President Bush's new envoy to Northern Ireland, Martin Reiss, met with all the groups.

Correction:  February 5, 2004, Thursday  A report in the World Briefing column yesterday about a review of the 1998 Northern Ireland peace accord by the British and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties misstated the given name of the Bush administration's new envoy to Northern Ireland, who met with all the groups. He is Mitchell Reiss, not Martin.
