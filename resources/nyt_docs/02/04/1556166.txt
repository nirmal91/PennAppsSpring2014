To the Editor:
There is an interesting juxtaposition of money lost and money found in today's news from Washington.
Would it be possible to apply the $27.4 million to be repaid by Halliburton for meals served to imaginary soldiers in Iraq, as well as the $6.3 million from Kellogg Brown &amp; Root for kickbacks on service in Kuwait (news article, Feb. 3) to offset the cutbacks in meal service to actual poor children in the United States that will doubtless result from the $1.1 billion cuts in the budget at Health and Human Services (news article, Feb. 3)?
Or are we saving our spare change for the Hot Lunches on Mars Program?
