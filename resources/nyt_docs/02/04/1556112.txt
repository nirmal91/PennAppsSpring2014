To the Editor:
The Sugar Association shares the concerns of Kelly D. Brownell and Marion Nestle (''The Sweet and Lowdown on Sugar,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 23) regarding the importance of reversing the worldwide trends in obesity. Their opinions provide precise evidence in support of our concerns regarding the World Health Organization report ''The Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases.''
Nutrition policy must be based on the strength of reproducible and published scientific evidence. Sugar consumption has declined over the last 30 years, while obesity has risen. It is difficult understanding how these experts could suggest an obvious relationship between sugar consumption and obesity.
Real sugar (sucrose) should not be confused with caloric sweeteners known as sugars.
ANDREW C. BRISCO III  President and Chief Executive  The Sugar Association  Washington, Jan. 26, 2004
