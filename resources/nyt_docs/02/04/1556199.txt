Following is an excerpt from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's speech last night as he informed supporters that he would pull out of the Democratic race for president, as recorded by The New York Times:
The judgment of the voters is now clear, and I want to congratulate John Kerry and John Edwards on the victories that they have won today. And I want to thank Wes Clark and Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton for their willingness to serve our country and for all that each of them has already contributed to this campaign and our great Democratic Party. Thank you.
But for me it is now time to make a difficult but realistic decision. After looking at the returns and speaking with my family and campaign team, I have decided tonight to end my quest for the presidency of the United States of America.
Am I disappointed? Naturally. But am I proud of what we stood for in this campaign? You bet I am. Thank you.
Am I grateful for the support that I received from all of you and so many people around the country? Yes, I am deeply grateful.
And am I committed to continuing to fight for the causes we campaigned for? You bet I am. Yes, indeed. I will continue to fight for a politics that puts the national interest ahead of special interests or partisan interests, for a Democratic Party that speaks openly and confidently about the importance of values and faith in our lives, for a Democratic Party that is strong on defense and unwavering on the war against terrorism and tyranny at home and throughout the world.
And I will keep working in every way I can to unite our people across lines of party and race and ethnicity and gender. We need to come together now as one people. We've been attacked by enemies who hate us more than they love life. Surely, in this difficult hour we Americans can find common ground on which to build a safer and a better future for our children.
