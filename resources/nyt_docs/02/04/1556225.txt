Because of editing errors, an article in The Arts on Thursday about the return of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to ABC and about that network's programming misstated the name of a comedy and its original broadcast date. It is ''According to Jim,'' not ''All About Jim''; its premiere was in October 2001, not in the last year.
