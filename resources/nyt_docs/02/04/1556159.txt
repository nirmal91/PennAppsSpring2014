To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd (column, Feb. 1) apparently isn't concerned when an irrational and ''homicidal, grenade-fishing Sinatra aficionado from Tikrit'' boasts of having weapons, preferring instead to wait for the notoriously inefficient United Nations inspectors to survey Iraq.
That's not rational.
