Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he would resign his committee post this month and would not seek re-election to a 13th term. Mr. Tauzin, 60, has been hospitalized twice in the last two months for a bleeding ulcer. The film and drug industries have both sought to recruit him as a lobbyist. A spokesman said that Mr. Tauzin ''has made no decisions about his future.''
