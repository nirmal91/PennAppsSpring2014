Nasser al-Kidwa, head of the Palestinian observer mission, criticized the Israeli ambassador, Dan Gillerman, for having accused Secretary General Kofi Annan of showing bias against Israel in his response to the suicide bombing in Jerusalem on Thursday that killed 10 and wounded 50. Mr. Gillerman had faulted Mr. Annan for making ''vague references'' to terror and violence instead of singling out the bombing for condemnation. Mr. Kidwa said the comments represented ''Israel's traditionally negative campaign against the U.N. and its typical tactics of intimidation in regards to actions by this world body.'' Mr. Kidwa said the Palestinian leadership had never complained to the secretary general directly about his condemnations of suicide bombings but had conveyed its concerns over the Secretariat's failure to express ''similar outrage to Israeli military assaults against the Palestinian civilian population.''
