An obituary of the Norwegian shipping magnate Arne Naess on Jan. 16 omitted some survivors. In addition to his two sons with the singer Diana Ross, they include his companion, Camilla Astrup; three children from his first marriage (two sons, Christoffer and Katinka, and a daughter, Leona, a pop singer); and his two sons with Ms. Astrup (Nicklas Amadeus and Louis Dekke.)
