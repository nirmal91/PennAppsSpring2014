Hal Kahn, the chief executive of the biggest division of Federated Department Stores for the last decade, is retiring on Feb. 15, the company said yesterday. Mr. Kahn, 58, is being succeeded as the head of the Macy's East division by Ronald Klein, 55, who has been running a smaller division for nearly three years.
Analysts said that the performance of the Macy's East division along with other units had been improving as the economy had recovered and that they regarded the change of leadership as routine.
''He's been chairman for 10 years of a $5-billion-a-year division and he's decided to do something else,'' a spokeswoman for Federated, Carol Sanger, said.
Federated reported better-than-expected earnings yesterday for the last quarter of 2003. But the company said that its earnings for 2004 might not meet analysts' expectations and, as a result, its share price fell 4.4 percent in late trading, to $46.50, after rising to $48.66 earlier in the day.
Federated reported net income of $2.47 a share, including 20 cents attributed to a tax benefit. Without the tax benefit, net income was $2.27 a share. Analysts had expected $2.19.
Analysts said they expected 2004 earnings of $3.80, but Federated said earnings would probably be $3.70 to $3.80 a share.
Mr. Kahn, who grew up in Brooklyn, began his career in retailing in 1970 at Abraham &amp; Straus, a department store chain with headquarters in the same borough. It was owned by Federated. Mr. Kahn joined R.H. Macy &amp; Company in 1975 and rose through the ranks there until 1992, when he moved to Montgomery Ward to become its president. After two years, he returned to Macy's in 1994 as chief executive of Macy's East, one of three divisions.
In late 1994, Federated bought Macy's and expanded the Macy's East division with the addition of the Abraham &amp; Straus and Jordan Marsh stores. Eventually, the Abraham &amp; Straus and Jordan Marsh brands were dropped.
Mr. Kahn graduated from City College in New York and received a master's in business administration from the University of Maryland.
Mr. Klein began his career in 1974 as a buyer for Bloomingdale's, one of the Federated stores. Federated is now the largest department store group in the country with more than 450 stores in 34 states.
