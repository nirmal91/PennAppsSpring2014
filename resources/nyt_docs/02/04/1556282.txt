The police arrested a Brooklyn man yesterday in connection with a fire that left two members of a Bushwick family dead last month, a Police Department spokesman said. The man, Jose Melendez, 26, of Halsey Street, was charged with murder, arson, and assault. The fire, at 407 Wilson Avenue, critically injured Gilbert Torres, 29, and his father, Ruben Torres, 73, both tenants in the building, the spokesman said. They died later from their injuries.
