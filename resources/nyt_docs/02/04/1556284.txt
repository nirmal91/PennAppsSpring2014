The Borough Council will consider repealing an antiloitering ordinance that critics said was a pretext to harass day laborers, many of whom are immigrants. In December, three advocacy groups and at least six laborers filed a federal lawsuit, claiming the ordinance unfairly targeted laborers who often obtained a day job by standing on a public sidewalk. Under the ordinance, which had been in effect since at least the 1970's, many laborers were given summonses and fined. The repeal will be placed on the council's agenda possibly as soon as Monday, Ms. Higgins said.
