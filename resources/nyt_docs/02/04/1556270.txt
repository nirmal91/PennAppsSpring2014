A car bombing in the southern city of Vladikavkaz killed at least one person and wounded 10 others in what appeared to be the latest in a string of terrorist bombings in Russia, officials told news agencies. The bomb exploded as a car carrying Russian military cadets was passing, wounding several, but it was not clear that they were the targets. Officials in Vladikavkaz, near Chechnya, did not immediately link the bomb to the war in Chechnya.
