To the Editor:
''If seeking the presidency is like reaching for the stars, then why not look to the stars -- and the other heavenly bodies -- for insights on the candidates.'' With that as justification, Erin Sullivan uses the public personas of the candidates to cast their horoscopes (''The Stars Have Voted,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 3).
Maybe this sort of thing can be extended to other historical issues.
If throwing tea into Boston Harbor will have consequences for our war with Britain, why not look at tea leaves to see what these might be?
Scientific issues might also be clarified. If we're unsure whether our industrial practices threaten biodiversity, why not study biorhythms to gain insight? Maybe we should keep on eye on black cats, too.
JOHN ALLEN PAULOS  Philadelphia, Feb. 3, 2004
