To the Editor:
Re ''Bush, in Budget, Seeks Increases Tied to Security'' (front page, Feb. 3):
A president is elected to serve the interests of the people who elect him. We have received the clearest sign to date of the Bush administration's blatant disregard for honesty with those whom it was ''elected'' to serve.
Americans should be outraged that the administration will wait until after the November election to spring another $50 billion spending bill on us for Iraq.
