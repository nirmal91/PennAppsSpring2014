To the Editor:
Re ''The Stars Have Voted,'' by Erin Sullivan (Op-Ed, Feb. 3):
Astrology teaches us much about cycles.
For example, in this election year, it suggests that major factions are splitting as they did in the Colonies (circa late 1750's), resulting in the American Revolution. Can another one be far behind?
As is well known, Sir Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Nicholas Copernicus and Hippocrates were all astrologers as well as men of science. Astronomy and astrology were completely integrated in their days.
I hope that Ms. Sullivan's intelligent presentation of astrology is just the first for The Times. Perhaps we now know what we've suspected all along: the Gray Lady always reads her horoscope like everyone else.
