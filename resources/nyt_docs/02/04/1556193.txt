To the Editor:
It is hard to believe that life expectancy in the United States, and indeed in much of the Western world, has increased manyfold, even while we fail to microwave our sponges, scrub the blades of our blenders before we put them in the dishwasher and fail to wash our hands when we enter the kitchen.
Of course, keeping the kitchen reasonably clean is good advice. And, yes, we all should take care not to contaminate our cutting surfaces with the bacteria from raw poultry or raw meats. But once one gets beyond these pieces of common sense, one quickly descends into the realm where small gains in safety come at the cost of increasingly complicated and time-consuming steps.
Human history suggests that our immune system does a reasonably good job of protecting us and that some exposure to bacteria may even help strengthen our ability to fight off the next round of infections.
Those who give advice should know when they cross the boundary from good insights into scaremongering.
