To the Editor:
Re ''A New Panel on Intelligence'' (editorial, Feb. 3):
Until now, going to war was the gravest, most important decision that a president could make. President Bush, however, not only made that life-and-death decision but also wants to lower the war threshold to pre-emption for all future presidents.
Our electoral calendar has delivered us a rare opportunity to review and debate these matters. Is there anything else more important to a voter's decision this November?
How can anyone (including The Times's editorial board) therefore advise that ''the public will probably need to wait until after the election to get its report,'' to avoid election-year politics?
Even if a complete report inexplicably takes more than eight months to compile, the panel should be required to issue at least two interim reports before the election.
An informed, participatory democracy demands nothing less.
