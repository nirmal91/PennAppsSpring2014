To the Editor:
If keeping my family safe from food-borne illness was as simple as washing my hands, my daughter would not have had a near-death experience with E. coli 0157:H7 in 1997. As consumers, how many products do we purchase that we are expected to take home and then have the responsibility to make sure that they do not kill our families? The responsibility should lie in the hands of the producers. Are industry practices ''squeaky clean''? Not even close.
