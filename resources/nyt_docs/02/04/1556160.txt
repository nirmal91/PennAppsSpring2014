To the Editor:
William Safire (column, Feb. 2) would have us remember that sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way. It is ironic that the sine qua non of this pyrotechnical skulduggery was information provided by none other than our buddies, the French, without which we might still be in the dark.
One wonders if the Bush administration has so subverted areas of common interest in international affairs as to obviate such sharing of intelligence today. Mr. Safire acknowledges implicitly that, tricky responses notwithstanding, our intelligence network had failed once again to acquire vital information by way of its own resources.
