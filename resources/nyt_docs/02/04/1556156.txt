To the Editor:
President Bush was right to invade Iraq (news articles, Feb. 1).
In the face of a possible threat to the United States, it was his job to act, not wait for the threat to be realized.
Most thought at the time that there were W.M.D. in Iraq. That Saddam Hussein was bluffing was uncertain, and his previous actions suggested that our worries were probably correct.
The president acted, as he should have.
