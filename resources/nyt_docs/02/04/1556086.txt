A new line of artfully wrought chocolates, above, is called the G Collection, which stands for none other than Godiva. These intense, top shelf confections were designed by Norman Love, a pastry chef. The chocolates, which have a three-week shelf life, are as delectable as they are elegant and pricey: about $100 a pound. Nine pieces are $25, 15 are $40 and 30 are $70, at the Godiva stores at 793 Madison Avenue (68th Street) and 200 Park Avenue (45th Street). They can also be ordered online from www.godiva.com.
Gotham Gardens, a florist at 325 Amsterdam Avenue (75th Street), sells superb chocolate confections made by Ortrud Carstens (including the solid chocolate lips, $75 a box, shown on the first page of this section). Her cocoa-dusted chocolate truffles ($75 for a box of 16) are delivered weekly. She is also known for her ''rusty tools,'' a set that includes a wrench and a screwdriver made of three kinds of chocolate, dusted in cocoa and sold in a wooden box for $65.
