To the Editor:
''Medicare Index,'' by Representative Sherrod Brown and Stephen Doyle (Op-Chart, Jan. 28), conveyed the impression that the elderly will not benefit from the Medicare prescription drug bill. In fact, the nearly five million elderly already enrolled in the private-sector Medicare option known as Medicare Advantage will see results this year, in lower out-of-pocket costs, better benefits and more choices.
Our survey of member companies shows that new financing in 2004 is being used to reduce premiums in plans representing more than 93 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries; enhance benefits in plans representing more than 60 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries; and reduce co-pays and deductibles in plans representing 81 percent of beneficiaries.
When the elderly have access to private-sector coverage options, their quality of care improves. Private health plans are more likely to provide coverage for critical services like beta blockers after heart attacks, annual flu vaccines, breast cancer screenings, diabetes testing and diabetes lipid screening.
