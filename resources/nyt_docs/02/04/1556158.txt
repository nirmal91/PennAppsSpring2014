To the Editor:
Re ''The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Feb. 1):
Is it any wonder that the Bush administration wrongly assumed that Saddam Hussein would act from a Western mind-set?
This administration is peopled with American corporate executives, whose actions and thought processes are the product of years of maturation in an environment that views the rest of the world as striving primarily to be like us.
It should not surprise us, therefore, that these officials would expect their foreign counterparts, as part of their striving, to behave as we would have them behave -- even a ''madman'' like Saddam Hussein.
