The Poetry Foundation, which made headlines 15 months ago when it received an astonishing gift worth more than $100 million, named John W. Barr its president yesterday. Mr. Barr has published poetry but is known mainly as a businessman and investment banker with the firm SG Barr Devlin, which handles mergers and acquisitions that sometimes exceed the billion-dollar level. Before becoming a co-founder of the firm in 1990, he was a managing director at Morgan Stanley. Financial dealing, however, does not take all of Mr. Barr's attention. He is also on the boards of Bennington College and the Yaddo art colony. The Chicago-based Poetry Foundation was for years a respected but decidedly low-budget operation known as the Modern Poetry Association. It announced its huge gift from the pharmaceutical heiress Ruth Lilly in November 2002 and changed its name soon afterward. A large part of Mr. Barr's role will be to decide how to use the money. ''This is a chance for me to combine and create a point of conjunction for what have been the two principal paths of my life, writing poetry and being a businessman,'' Mr. Barr said. ''I dream of seeing the Poetry Foundation built and operated like a well-run company. The business purpose is to make an important home for American poetry, but I also hope to set an example by making this run well from a business point of view.''
