Racial profiling of motorists by the police persists across Texas despite laws and regulations intended to discourage it, a report commissioned by human rights and civil liberties groups said. A survey of law enforcement records from a fourth of Texas's 1,500 police agencies found that blacks and Hispanics were significantly more likely to be stopped and searched than whites. The report said the police in Houston and in Dallas were three and a half times more likely to search a black driver than a white one.
