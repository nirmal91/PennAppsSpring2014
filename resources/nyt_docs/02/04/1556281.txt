Three city councilwomen yesterday proposed creating a City Council Independent Office of Workplace Integrity to investigate sexual harassment, ethics and discrimination complaints involving council members and their staffs. Councilwoman Margarita López, left, who made the proposal with Councilwomen Annabel Palma and Sara M. Gonzalez, said it was partly in response to the investigation of Councilman Allan W. Jennings, a Queens Democrat who has been accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by two former aides. ''I felt that the procedures that were in place were not enough,'' Councilwoman López said.
