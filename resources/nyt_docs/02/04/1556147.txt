Nets forward Eddie Griffin was ordered by Judge Mike Anderson yesterday to remain in jail without bond, at least for the next 10 days, Jane Waters, a Harris County assistant district attorney, said.
Anderson, who called Griffin a danger to the community, made the decision after hearing testimony from a witness who said that Griffin tried to run him over with his sport utility vehicle during an altercation outside a gas station in Houston on Dec. 23.
Griffin is accused of violating his 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and was arrested Monday in Houston. He is due in court Feb. 13 for a bond hearing, a hearing for his felony assault case and a sentencing hearing for his marijuana conviction.
''We're looking at the option of appealing,'' Rusty Hardin, Griffin's lawyer, said last night. He added, ''We're trying to convince the judge to let him go to a treatment program.''
Griffin was scheduled to enter the Betty Ford Center in California today for six weeks of inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse.
The Nets signed Griffin to a minimum contract worth about $400,000 on Jan. 8; he left the team last week to receive therapy.
