The state Board of Pardons and Paroles has granted parole to a Spalding County woman who shot her two terminally ill sons to death in June 2002. The woman, Carol Carr, 65, pleaded guilty to assisted suicide in the deaths of her sons Michael R. Scott, 42, and Andy B. Scott, 41, who were in the advanced stages of Huntington's disease, and was sentenced to five years in prison. Ms. Carr will be released in March, after serving one month more than the minimum possible. A condition of her parole is that she not live with or become responsible for the care of her surviving son, James Scott, who also has the disease.
