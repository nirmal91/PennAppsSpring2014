Ciba Specialty Chemicals said its profit fell 55 percent, to 43 million Swiss francs ($34 million), in the last quarter of 2003 as a result of price pressure from emerging markets and temporary plant closings. Sales fell 3 percent, to 1.6 billion Swiss francs. Ciba -- which is based in Basel and makes plastics, car paints and textiles -- said profit for the year was down 15 percent, to 344 million Swiss francs, while sales were down 6 percent, to 6.65 billion francs. Analysts said the figures were below expectations, and the share price fell 2 percent. The chief executive, Armin Meyer, said Ciba had done its homework by cutting costs. Those cuts included expenses of a 2 percent reduction of the work force, but Mr. Meyer said the company's results would pick up only when market conditions improved. Despite a tough year, Ciba said it cut its debt 28 percent and had cash reserves of 728 million francs. He said Ciba was considering 10 takeover candidates but declined to identify them.
