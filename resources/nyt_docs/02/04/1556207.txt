The pharmaceutical and chemicals company Akzo Nobel said its 2003 net profit fell 9 percent, to 811 million euros ($1 billion), excluding one-time restructuring charges. Sales last year were down 7 percent, to 13.1 billion euros. The company attributed the declines to a weak dollar, rising pension fund costs and a surge in generic drugs that compete in the United States with its best-selling antidepressant, Remeron. Akzo anticipates that its net income this year, not including one-time gains, will be below that of 2003. Its fourth-quarter net income was up 52 percent, to 268 million euros, from the period a year earlier, in part because of an 88 million euro payment from Pfizer that was made in connection with a drug development program.
