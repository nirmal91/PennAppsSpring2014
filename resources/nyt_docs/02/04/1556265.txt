A New Jersey couple was charged with forcing their young foster daughter to wait on an elderly relative as he lay dead in an upstairs bedroom, officials said yesterday.
The Clark, N.J., foster parents, Donna and Kenneth Keaveney, were charged with child cruelty and elder neglect, the Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, and the Clark police chief, Anton Danco, said in a statement. The police had found the body of Ms. Keaveney's father, Nicola Lombardi, 82, in the couple's house on Willow Way in August.
Yesterday, officials said the 13-year-old girl was made to tend to the dead man. Police Capt. Denis Connell declined to give further details last night. The Associated Press reported that the girl was sent to the room with meals.
"The evidence in this case points to only one conclusion," Mr. Romankow said. "They both knew the grandfather had passed away and was rotting to the point where the house reeked of death."
The daughter, whose name was not released by the police, was one of three children in the Keaveney home, authorities said.
The charges followed a five-month investigation into the couple, after authorities found Mr. Lombardi's decaying body last Aug. 28, the police and prosecutor said.
In a separate investigation, the couple is also being examined by New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services, which has removed all three children from the Keaveney home.
Ms. Keaveney, 36, and Mr. Keaveney, 37, are expected to appear in court next week, Chief Danco said. The couple could not be reached for comment last night.
