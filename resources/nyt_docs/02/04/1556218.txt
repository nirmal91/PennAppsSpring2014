Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the creation of a commission to investigate intelligence shortcomings related to the Iraq war misstated the day that The Washington Post published an interview with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in which he said that he did not know whether he would have recommended invading Iraq based on the intelligence now available. It was yesterday, not Monday.
