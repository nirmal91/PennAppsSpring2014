A former member of a religious sect has been acquitted of murder for starving her infant son to death to fulfill a religious prophecy. But the defendant, Karen Robidoux, was convicted of assault and battery in the 1999 death of her son, Samuel, who was deprived of food for 51 days and died shortly before his first birthday. Ms. Robidoux was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but was immediately released on time served. She belonged to the Body, a religious sect that shunned modern medicine. Ms. Robidoux's husband, Jacques, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2002.
