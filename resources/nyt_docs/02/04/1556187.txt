To the Editor:
Amanda Hesser's article ''Squeaky Clean? Not Even Close'' (Jan. 28) provides practical advice about precautions in the kitchen. However, it also reinforces the blame-the-victim mentality. This mind-set lets government and business sidestep accountability to clean up their own food safety policies.
Our daughter contracted E. coli 0157:H7 five years ago. She developed a dangerous complication of the disease that led to kidney failure and critical anemia. We could not prove the origin of the illness or prevent the source from infecting others because there is no tracking system or government commitment to hold industry and food handlers (outside the home) accountable.
Consumers cannot fight food-borne disease alone. The government needs to mandate regulations, vigorous testing and tracking of meat, to prevent these pathogens from entering our homes, restaurants and schools.
