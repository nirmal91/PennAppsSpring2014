Rise, the bar on the 14th floor of the Ritz-Carlton New York in Battery Park, is adding a diet-defying chocolate buffet. More than 30 chocolate desserts and confections, including bananas Foster chocolate pudding, chocolate ganache pyramid, white chocolate mousse cake, peanut crunch-almond dacquoise and the most silken chocolate marshmallows imaginable will be available starting Friday, and continuing every Friday and Saturday from 8 p.m. to midnight throughout the month. The pastry chef, Laurent Richard, above, has even constructed a chocolate fountain. ''I've gone through about 200 pounds of chocolate,'' he said.
The buffet, which includes a glass of Champagne, is $35 a person: (917) 790-2571.
