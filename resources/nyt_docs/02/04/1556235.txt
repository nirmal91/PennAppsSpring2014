Good Technology introduced an update to its software yesterday that aims to make cellphones more like laptop computers. Executives at a gathering in San Francisco showed off some of the new features in the company's GoodLink 3.0 messaging software, which include the ability to easily perform more than one task at a time, to view PC files in their native format and to preview incoming e-mail in ways similar to Microsoft's Outlook application. Good also announced that it would add support for Windows Mobile-based devices, including hand-helds based on the Pocket PC operating system. GoodLink already works on RIM devices as well as on palmOne's Treo 600. While the company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has been making inroads in the hand-held software and service market, RIM remains the leader, having signed more than one million customers for its wireless messaging service. The GoodLink event drew several top executives, like Palm's co-founder, Jeff Hawkins, and executives from Electronic Arts, Dell and Microsoft.
