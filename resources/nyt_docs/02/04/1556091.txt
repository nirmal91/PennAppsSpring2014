Coffee from Arabia, chocolate from Mexico and tea from Asia became popular in Europe in the 17th century, and each inspired utensils for its preparation and service.
One hundred of these objects are on display through July 11 in the Special Exhibitions Gallery at the entrance to the Lehman Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
A rare late 17th-century silver English chocolate pot based on a Chinese shape, right, has a detachable cap under which the stirrer, or molinet, can sit. Hot chocolate has to be stirred because the cocoa sinks to the bottom. An English silver teapot on a tripod stand, a Delft-style coffee pot made in China, and a tall silver chocolate pot are some others. Schedules of free lectures by curators are available from www.metmuseum.org.
