The abandoned Flushing Airport will be transformed into a complex for 180 small businesses, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and city officials said yesterday. The redevelopment is part of a $175-million private project at the College Point Corporate Park. It is estimated that the 26-acre site, which will include building space, wetlands and public nature trails, will create about 420 new industrial jobs for the city during the next five to seven years. To help with the project, city officials plan to spend $8 million on road reconstruction to link the new complex to the surrounding community.
