A Queens man pleaded guilty yesterday to impregnating a 9-year-old Brooklyn girl, the daughter of his girlfriend at the time, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said. The man, Chancellor Drayton, a 43-year-old street vendor from Astoria, was arrested on Nov. 5, 2002, and was initially indicted on a charge of first-degree rape. The police said he had had sexual relations with the girl repeatedly while the mother was running errands. The girl's mother, after reading incriminating notes, contacted the police, and the girl, 15 weeks pregnant, had an abortion. Mr. Drayton pleaded guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court in Queens to first-degree course of sexual conduct against a child. Justice Barry Kron indicated that he would sentence Mr. Drayton to 20 years in jail on Feb. 26.
