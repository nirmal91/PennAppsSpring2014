To the Editor:
You write that in November voters will have to decide ''how to weigh allegations that administration officials pressured intelligence analysts to modify their findings to increase public support for the war'' (''A New Panel on Intelligence,'' editorial, Feb. 3).
I hope that the voters will hold the administration to a higher standard of responsibility.
Not only the issue of the administration's possible wrongdoing is important. Even more important is whether the administration did what is right.
Did it challenge intelligence findings that were pushing us into a war? If not, why not?
