Larry A. Silverstein's effort to rebuild 7 World Trade Center suffered a setback yesterday when Moody's Investors Service sharply downgraded its assessment of his $383 million in debt on the property. The bond rating agency tied the downgrade to the developer's lack of progress in settling an insurance dispute over the original building after obtaining new financing and a tenant for the 52-story tower he has begun to build, said James Church, a senior analyst at Moody's. The original building was destroyed in the trade center attack. Although Mr. Silverstein has been at odds with Industrial Risk Insurers over the value of the property, he has started building a $700 million skyscraper on the site, at Washington and Vesey Streets. But rents downtown have fallen sharply, and there are few prospective tenants.
