To the Editor:
I'm a Republican, but I switched parties to vote for John Edwards in the Iowa caucuses.
William Safire (column, Feb. 18) indicates that Senator Edwards is engaged in class warfare, but the issue that resonated with Wisconsin voters was outsourcing, and outsourcing in America, except for perhaps newspaper pundits, is no longer a class issue.
Given the outsourcing of computer programmers and computer help technicians to India, Mr. Edwards's message of slowing outsourcing may play well in high-tech states like California or even Massachusetts.
