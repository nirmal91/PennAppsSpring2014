The Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB reported a fourth-quarter loss of $387 million, an improvement on its loss of $828 million in the period a year earlier. For the year, ABB lost $767 million, its third consecutive annual loss, but a slight improvement from its loss of $783 million a year earlier. The company attributed the improvement to strong performance in its core divisions of power and automation technologies, as well as to cost-cutting and layoffs. ABB said asset sales helped reduce its debt to $7.9 billion at the end of 2003 from $8.3 billion a year earlier. The chief executive, JÃ¼rgen Dormann, above, who provided the fourth-quarter figures during a conference call, said he expected ABB to be profitable in 2004 and 2005.
