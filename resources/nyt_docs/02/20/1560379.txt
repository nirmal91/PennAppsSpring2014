Lawyers for former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards have asked that the verdict that sent him to federal prison for 10 years be vacated because his trial was unfair. Mr. Edwards, 76, was convicted in 2000 of extorting payoffs for casino riverboat licenses. His lawyers say that prosecutors failed to disclose a key witness's financial incentive to testify and that one juror thought Mr. Edwards had not used his influence to help investigate her daughter's death.
