The body of a 52-year-old man who disappeared nearly a month ago washed up onto a beach in Nissequogue yesterday morning, the Suffolk County police said. The man, Isaiah Williams, was an outpatient at Pilgrim State Psychiatric Hospital and lived at a group home in Central Islip. The police said he often wandered away, but usually returned home on his own. The police would not say exactly where Mr. Williams lived, nor whether anyone had seen him after he was reported missing on Jan. 26. An autopsy had not been conducted as of last evening, but the police said there were no signs of foul play.
