The intense off-season competition between the Boston Red Sox and the Yankees may not be finished. Both are interested in the veteran right-hander Orlando Hernández.
Michael Maulini, who works for the agent Jeff Moorad in coordinating Hernández's schedule, said the Yankees recently offered Hernández $1 million to sign a one-year deal. Hernández rejected it, Maulini said, for several reasons -- none of the money was guaranteed and he would not be included, at least initially, on the 40-man roster.
Meanwhile, the Red Sox asked Hernández to go to their training base in Fort Myers, Fla., on Wednesday and audition for them. He rejected the offer, not wanting to look too eager or desperate, even with spring training beginning, Maulini said.
General Manager Brian Cashman said that the Yankees would scout Hernández on Monday at an open workout in Miami, just as they did on Jan. 22 with 18 other teams.
At the first workout, Hernández was just starting to feel some ease in pitching again after having rotator cuff surgery last May. He said his aim was to show he was healthy, not to test any radar guns, and his velocity showed it. In 35 pitches, Hernández's fastball never exceeded 78 miles an hour.
But Maulini said that Hernández's fastball had reached 86 to 87 m.p.h. in workouts at a Miami park and that scouts would see a much-improved Hernández next week.
Hernández pitched for the Yankees for five seasons. During that time the club won three World Series titles and narrowly missed a fourth. He had a 53-38 regular-season record and was 10-2 in the postseason.
As Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees' vice president for professional scouting, said recently of Hernández, ''He helped put rings on a lot of fingers.''
The most controversial thing about Hernández is his age. He has claimed to be 34, but in a divorce proceeding in the late 1990's, his date of birth was listed as Oct. 11, 1965, which would make him 38 now.
