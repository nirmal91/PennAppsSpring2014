To the Editor:
Re ''Goodbye, Candidate Dean'' (editorial, Feb. 19):
Say not goodbye, but au revoir. Because even though Howard Dean is no longer a candidate, we, his followers, will be here to make sure that the spine that Dr. Dean has injected into the Democratic Party doesn't get removed because he is out of the race.
The future belongs to us, and the powers that be had better learn to deal with it.
