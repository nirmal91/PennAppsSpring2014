To the Editor:
Re ''Goodbye, Candidate Dean'' (editorial, Feb. 19):
Inspirational is not a word I have ever used in my life. But I found Howard Dean to be an inspirational speaker, both in form and content, especially in his speech just after the Wisconsin primary.
This is a man who has been poorly served by blistering criticism from many in the media as well as his own party. But he has had the courage to speak without platitudes or oratory to the many people who feel disenfranchised by the administration in Washington.
I only hope that a place of importance is found for him in what I hope will be the Democratic White House we'll have after November 2004.
