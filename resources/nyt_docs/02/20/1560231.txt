To the Editor:
I appreciated seeing George McGovern's advice about ending the United States presence in Iraq (''Advice to Kerry on Exiting Iraq,'' letter, Feb. 18).
Having served three tours in Vietnam, I voted for Mr. McGovern in 1972 for just one reason: to stop the useless slaughter.
Instead, we got the peace-with-honor, stay-the-course guy, and 20,000 more Americans and who knows how many more Vietnamese died in a long-lost cause.
Bad policies, failed policies, reckless and thoughtless policies are not worth the bones of a single American.

Correction:  February 25, 2004, Wednesday  A letter on Friday about the death toll in Iraq misstated the timing of 20,000 of the American deaths in Vietnam. They occurred from 1969 to 1972, not after the 1972 presidential election.
