Sport utility vehicles made Patrick Dillon see red, according to the police.
In a more-than-two-month spree in Manhattan, Mr. Dillon, a 53-year-old building superintendent in Manhattan, squirted more than two dozen sport utility vehicles with red paint from a ketchup-like squeeze bottle, police officials said.
Last night, the police charged him with criminal mischief.
At 6:40 p.m., Capt. James W. Murtaugh, who was on patrol on his bicycle on West 77th Street near Columbus Avenue, rode past a man also on a bicycle, dressed in a black shirt, black hat, and black camouflage pants, with a black scarf wrapped around his face, holding a squeeze bottle, he said.
''I made a U-turn and I was able to observe a squeeze bottle,'' Captain Murtaugh said.
Captain Murtaugh searched the man's pockets, and found two other squeeze bottles, the police said, Mr. Dillon's black mountain bike had red paint splattered on the tires.
Mr. Dillon was carrying a notebook, police officials said. It contained the words, ''100 S.U.V's are wearing my colors,'' and, ''next it will be a barbeque,'' a phrase investigators believe was a reference to setting vehicles on fire.
Police officials suspect that he first struck in December, when reports of paint-daubed S.U.V's surfaced, most on the Upper West Side.
In all, 27 vehicles were squirted.
