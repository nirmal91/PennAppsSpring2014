The Reed Elsevier Group, the British-Dutch publisher, has topped analysts' expectations for the year, reporting a net profit for 2003 of Â£334 million ($630 million), an 85 percent increase over 2002. The company, which sells textbooks, publishes the entertainment industry newspaper Variety and maintains the LexisNexis database, warned investors that it did not expect similar gains this year, in part because of an expected decline in school textbook sales in the United States. The Reed Elsevier group is owned by Reed Elsevier of London and Reed Elsevier of the Netherlands.
