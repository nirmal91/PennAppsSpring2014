The Department of Homeland Security recommended that Attorney General John Ashcroft grant asylum to a Guatemalan woman in a case that may have far-reaching implications for women seeking asylum in the United States on the grounds that they were persecuted because of their sex. The woman, Rodi Alvarado Pena, fled her country to escape an abusive husband. Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said a final decision from Mr. Ashcroft was expected soon.
