Marc Bell, a gifted 32-year-old Vancouver cartoonist, draws comics for free weekly newspapers in Montreal and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and publishes his own comic books. This is his first solo gallery exhibition.
Mr. Bell's zanily complicated fine-line ink drawings and paintings, like medieval manuscript pages with collage and sculptural elements sometimes added, don't deal in logical narratives. The delight of his work is in the play of a free-associating and funny imagination.
His pages are populated by all kinds of animated beings: humans, animals and acutely observed ordinary objects. There are bricks with feet, talking plants and foods, landscapes that awaken into godlike giants, and visionary amalgamations like the ''old man baby dogman centaur.'' There are wild shifts of space, time and scale. And the wordplay, in speech bubbles, signs and expository boxes, is almost as entertaining as the profusion of imagery.
You can see reflections of other comics artists in Mr. Bell's work: R. Crumb, Mark Alan Stamaty, Jim Nutt, Richard Scarry (the children's book illustrator) and even Philip Guston, who as a big-eyed character in huge shoes and a high-collar shirt becomes the hero of a surrealistic 14-page mini-epic, drawn in black lines and called ''Gustun.'' Bosch and Bruegel would also be in the mix.
As with the genre's best artists, there is more here than just amusing cleverness. You get the feeling that the artist is struggling to track the incomprehensible flux of his own psyche.
