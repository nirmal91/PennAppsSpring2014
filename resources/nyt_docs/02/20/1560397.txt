An article on Wednesday about B. S. A. Tahir, a businessman based in Malaysia who has been a subject of investigations related to the trade in nuclear weapons technology, misspelled the surname of his wife and linked her erroneously with another businessman in Malaysia. She is Nazimah Binti Syed Majid, not Jajid. She is not a cousin or other relative of Shah Hakim Zain, an owner of Kaspadu, an investment holding company that is the major owner of Scomi Group Berhad, which has a subsidiary that made nuclear centrifuge parts.
The article also misstated her current connection to Kaspadu. She did not rejoin the board after her husband stepped down as a director in early 2003, and she sold her shares in the company to Shah Hakim Zain and another Kaspadu owner on Jan. 7, not in the first week of February.
