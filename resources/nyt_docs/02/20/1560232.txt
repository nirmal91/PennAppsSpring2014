To the Editor:
''Squeezing the Poor for Votes'' (editorial, Feb. 18) says President Bush's budget ''would leave profligate Republicans picking on the poor in a desperate attempt to stand for fiscal responsibility.'' I would change the ending to read ''picking on the poor in a cruel pretense of standing for fiscal responsibility.''
Mr. Bush's mean-spirited cuts in programs that help the most vulnerable people in our population -- the poor, the elderly and the disabled -- would save about what the Bush administration spends in four days of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
These cuts are a sham and will solve nothing.
