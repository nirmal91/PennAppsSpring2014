Swaziland, in the third year of a crippling drought, has declared a state of national disaster and will require extensive food assistance until at least after the 2005 harvest , the World Food Program stated. Malnutrition is also contributing to outbreaks of AIDS among the 30 percent of Swazi citizens who are H.I.V. positive, many of whom have been weakened by poor diets. The agency, already struggling to meet an increased demand for aid in Zimbabwe and other southern African nations, appealed to foreign donors to increase their contributions.
