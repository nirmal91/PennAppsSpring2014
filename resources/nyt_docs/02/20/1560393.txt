About 50 animals, including pigs, chickens and newborn goats, were killed early Wednesday morning in a Westchester County barn fire that was apparently caused by a malfunctioning space heater, the Bedford Fire Department said yesterday. No humans were injured in the fire, which was contained to the barn. By the time firefighters arrived, the flames were through the roof, officials said.
