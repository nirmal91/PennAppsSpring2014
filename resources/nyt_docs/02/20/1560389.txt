Ethan Cohen  37 Walker Street, TriBeCa  Through March 6
Maybe it's time for a moratorium on sex in art. Given the mainstream ubiquity of pornography, it's hard to see what art might contribute to our supposed continuing liberation from Victorian repression. Though not without entertainment value, ''Sexy Beasts,'' a selection of more or less explicitly sexual artworks from four decades, leaves you feeling tired of the whole subject.
The best reason to see the show is the funny and horrifying quartet of life-size, primary color latex sex dolls that Vito Acconci made in 1971. Also from the early years, there are Carolee Schneemann's famous mock-orgy film, ''Meat Joy,'' and a lacy, labial latex sculpture by Hannah Wilke. Works from the 1980's include a demure photograph of two women in a bar by Nan Goldin and Marilyn Minter's pointedly drippy paintings based on pornographic close-ups.
Recent items include Dana Schutz's comically tender painting of a naked purple man lounging odalisque-style on a beach; Kiki Seror's hypnotically abstracted pornographic video loop; and a machine by Jon Kessler in which a naked doll goes round and round while her face appears continuously, its eyes rhythmically opening and shutting, on a small video screen.
These and other works may be fine, taken one at a time, but cumulatively the show makes you feel trapped in a one-dimensional universe. In a deadpan watercolor made recently by Guy Richards Smit, one of three naked people in a postclimactic moment asks, ''Where do we go from here?'' It's a good question.
