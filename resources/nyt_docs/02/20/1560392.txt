Roth Horowitz  160A East 70th Street, Manhattan  Through Feb. 28
The best thing about Aglaia Konrad's New York debut is ''Elasticity,'' a book of her photographs published in Rotterdam in 1998, which is available at the gallery. Filled with Ms. Konrad's black-and-white photographs of sprawling urban networks, shot from the windows of commercial airliners from Dakar to Paris, the book provides a strong dose of the thrill and horror of the late 20th-century metropolis.
Ms. Konrad, who was born in Salzburg, Austria, in 1960, and lives in Brussels and Rotterdam, has the relentless focus of Bernd and Hilla Becher, who spent more than 30 years making impeccable images of the immense, often majestic structures of industry, one building or compound at a time. Pulling back for the long view, with little attention to craft or technique, Ms. Konrad substitutes a terrain of unimaginable proportions and Piranesian madness. She replaces consciousness with unconsciousness.
Ms. Konrad comes closest to the Bechers in her images of individual buildings, usually small skyscrapers, that dominate the show. But even these structures, which the artist calls urban creatures, have a madness and incoherence about them. Ms. Konrad's aerial views are represented by 12 small images from her ''Boeing Over'' series. Something of her appetite for her subject is evident in two videotapes of different cities, shot from moving cars. (She also does installation works and slide projection pieces, one of which was in ''Cities on the Move'' at P.S. 1 in 1998.)
In bits and pieces this show introduces a grand obsession that would appear to be equal to its task: to document the global centers of late capitalism in all their frightening glory.
