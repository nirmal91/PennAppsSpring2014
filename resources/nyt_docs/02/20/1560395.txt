The Roman Catholic Dioceses of Metuchen and Paterson said this week that they had spent some $3.6 million in legal fees, settlements and other costs over allegations that their priests abused children. The Paterson Diocese said Wednesday in its weekly newspaper that 71 abuse allegations had been made against 39 priests among the 737 priests who served the diocese from 1950 to 2002, The Associated Press reported. The report said, however, that 56 of those claims had been deemed credible and that the diocese had spent about $2.8 million since 1950 on fees and settlements related to the claims. The Metuchen Diocese said in a report published in its newspaper yesterday that it had spent $795,000 in legal and medical fees and settlements on 18 priests and one deacon out of its 990 clergymen who had been credibly accused of sexual abuse involving minors.
