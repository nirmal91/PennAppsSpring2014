Hundreds of thousands of volunteers will begin going from house to house next week to give polio immunizations to 63 million children in 10 countries in the World Health Organization's latest effort to eliminate the disease. The program is to begin Monday in Nigeria and Niger, where polio is endemic. Immunizations will also be conducted next week in seven countries that had eliminated the disease before cases were recently spread from Nigeria and Niger: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Togo. Chad will begin its program next month. Polio has mostly spread from the Kano region in northern Nigeria, where Islamic leaders have stopped immunizations because they say the vaccine sterilizes girls. The W.H.O. has conducted independent tests to refute the charges and is optimistic that Kano will participate, a spokesman for the agency said.
