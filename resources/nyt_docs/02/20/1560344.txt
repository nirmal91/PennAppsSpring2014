The insurance and banking concern ING said that its income fell 10 percent last year, to 4 billion euros ($5 billion). The decline resulted mostly from an accounting change and on an operating basis income was up 18 percent. ING said it could not provide a specific forecast for the current year, disappointing some investors, and its shares fell 1 percent. Better results from its banking division contributed to ING's improved performance. One bright spot was ING Direct, its Internet banking division, which has operations in several countries including the United States. ING Direct booked a 2003 pretax operating profit of 151 million euros in contrast to a loss of 48 million euros in 2002.
