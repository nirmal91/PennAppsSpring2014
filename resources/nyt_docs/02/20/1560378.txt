The speaker of the Texas House has been ordered to turn over documents to a grand jury in Austin investigating the activities of a political action committee created by Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader in Congress. The committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, helped Republicans take control of the Texas Legislature in 2002, and documents show it often coordinated with State Representative Tom Craddick, whom lawmakers chose as speaker after the election.
