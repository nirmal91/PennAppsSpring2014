To the Editor:
Re ''Edwards Proves His Point With a Strong Late Surge'' (news article, Feb. 18): I am glad that the mainstream media are finally taking notice of Senator John Edwards's popularity among independents and crossover Republicans.
The hype about John Kerry's ''electability'' has been perpetuated by his strong showings among Democrats, most of whom will vote for the party's nominee, whoever it is. In the end, swing voters will determine the outcome of this election. Senator Edwards is clearly their choice.
