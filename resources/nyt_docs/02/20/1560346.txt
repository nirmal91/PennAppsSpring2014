A judge in Salzburg acquitted 16 defendants accused of criminal responsibility for the deaths of 155 people in a fire at a ski resort in 2000. The defendants included technicians, government inspectors and representatives of companies who installed or operated equipment on a funicular rail car that burst into fire in a tunnel at Kaprun ski resort, south of Salzburg. According to testimony, the fire was caused by a malfunctioning heater. Family members protested the ruling, and the prosecutor said she would appeal, but the judge, who allowed that he did not have ''an easy time reaching this decision,'' said the train ''conformed to the latest technical standards and all requirements were fulfilled.''
