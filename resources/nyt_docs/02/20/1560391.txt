A firehouse staffed with Emergency Medical Service workers instead of firefighters opened officially yesterday in the Rossville section of Staten Island. The 14,227-square-foot building, which cost $10.7 million, will be used to house ambulances, decontamination units and bunks for emergency service workers. Before the opening, emergency workers were stationed at a local hospital.
