To the Editor:
Re ''Kerry Holds Off Push by Edwards in Wisconsin Vote'' (front page, Feb. 18):
The unexpectedly close vote in the Wisconsin primary shows that Senator John Kerry will not become the Democratic standard-bearer without a fight and that Senator John Edwards will provide it in the primaries to be held in the next few weeks.
The coming block primaries are now critical. If Mr. Kerry comes through them and, irrespective of their closeness, maintains his string of wins, he can begin uniting the Democratic Party and focus on convincing independent voters that he is capable of defeating President Bush.
Having demonstrated his resiliency in the past, we anticipate he will do so again.
