To the Editor:
Howard Dean's run for the presidency was not in vain. Hundreds of thousands of Americans responded to his spirited stand against the unnecessary Iraq war and President Bush's disingenuous campaign to rush us into it.
Moreover, as he intended, Dr. Dean inspired many voters to take an actively impassioned role in the coming election. I am one of them.
