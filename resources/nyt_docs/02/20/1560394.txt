A Bronx man was arrested Wednesday evening, after he called the city's 311 information hotline and threatened to kill Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, law enforcement officials said last night. The man, Awlia Yaya, who was born in Afghanistan and has permanent resident status in the United States, remained on the phone long enough for the Police Department to trace the call to his address on White Plains Road. Mr. Yaya, 38, was arrested at an address on White Plains Road and charged with criminal possession of a weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, and aggravated harassment, the authorities said. Investigators have not uncovered any connections between Mr. Yaya, who has been in this country since 1987, and any terrorist organization, though law enforcement officials said they were continuing to investigate. The police said there was evidence that Mr. Yaya had been drinking.
