To the Editor:
Re ''And Now There Are Two'' (editorial, Feb. 19):
You say voters in Democratic primaries have a choice between two candidates since Howard Dean dropped out. In fact, voters can choose among four good, principled candidates.
According to the news media, Dennis J. Kucinich and the Rev. Al Sharpton do not even exist. You may not agree with them and you may not think that either of them has a chance, but their names will be on the ballot when I go to vote in Ohio on March 2.
