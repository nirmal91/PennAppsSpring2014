I.B.M. plans to announce today an agreement to sell 20 of its largest mainframe computers to a German technology services company as part of a four-year contract, whose value analysts estimated at roughly $200 million. The customer, Sparkassen Informatik, is the leading supplier of information technology services to the German banking industry. For I.B.M., the deal is an endorsement of its strategy of positioning its mainframes as the preferred computers at the heart of data-center consolidation projects.
