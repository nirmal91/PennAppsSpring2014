To the Editor:
One phrase in your Feb. 19 editorial ''Goodbye, Candidate Dean'' captured the essence of Howard Dean's achievement: ''He transplanted a spine into the presidential campaign.''
The Democrats' fear of President Bush in the pre-Dean period left me wringing my hands. As Mr. Bush perpetrated one flagrant injury after another on the environment, our civil liberties, the economy and our country's standing in the world community, the Democrats cowered, fearing Mr. Bush's good poll numbers.
It took Howard Dean to mount a loyal, yet fierce, opposition. I am in his debt.
