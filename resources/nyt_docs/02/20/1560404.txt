The Antiques column in Weekend last Friday about marine paintings referred incorrectly to Castle Garden, a Lower Manhattan building that appears in a painting of the schooner Resolute made around 1878 by James Buttersworth. The building still stands but is now known as Castle Clinton, no longer Castle Garden.
