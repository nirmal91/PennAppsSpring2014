Alfonso Portillo, the president of Guatemala until last month, left the country for Mexico while under investigation for corruption. Mexican officials said Mr. Portillo entered the country on a tourist visa. On Wednesday, Guatemala's highest court stripped him of immunity from prosecution. An investigation into the disappearance of federal funds into Panamanian bank accounts is under way in Guatemala.
