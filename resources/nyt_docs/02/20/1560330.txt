To the Editor:
Three cheers to Nicholas D. Kristof (''Vrooming Into Yellowstone,'' column, Feb. 18). I believe in protecting the environment, but doing it in a compromise with humans, not by barring them.
The challenge to the snowmobile industry is to produce cleaner, quieter, more efficient machines -- and it is responding. Most families who use snowmobiles have a deep respect for the environment.
The conflict seems to have been fanned by radical elements on both sides of the issue. I hope that clearer-thinking individuals will craft a compromise. Compared with the vacationers coming by car and RV, snowmobilers leave a pretty small footprint.
