A Taliban commander, Mullah Dadullah, warned Afghans not to take part in elections scheduled for this year or they would risk attack. He also said the Taliban would continue its violent opposition to the Afghan government and the reconstruction process led by the United States. ''We don't want their asphalt, and we don't want their help,'' he told the BBC.
