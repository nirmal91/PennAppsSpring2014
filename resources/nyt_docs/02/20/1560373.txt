Pfizer has asked several agencies on its roster to develop new creative ideas for the direct-to-consumer account of Viagra, which is handled by Cline Davis &amp; Mann in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. Billings were estimated at $90 million to $100 million.
A spokeswoman at Pfizer in New York, Michal Fishman, confirmed reports of the move that appeared on AdAge.com and Adweek.com, but said that the account was not up for review. ''We're trying to get additional creative ideas to provide the best insight to breaking barriers that men have to seeking treatment,'' Ms. Fishman said. Pfizer sought ideas from ''several'' roster agencies, including Cline Davis, she said, declining to be more specific. No outside agencies were contacted, she said.
Agencies handling work for Pfizer include Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas; Berlin Cameron/Red Cell, part of the WPP Group; the Kaplan Thaler Group, part of the Publicis Groupe; McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies; and Merkley &amp; Partners, part of Omnicom.
Separately, a Viagra commercial that was introduced last year in Canada began appearing in the United States on Sunday. That spot was created by another Pfizer agency, Taxi in Montreal and Toronto.
