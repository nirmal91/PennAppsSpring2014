InnerLandscapes Dance Theater presented a program called ''Evidence of Light'' on Sunday night at the Joyce SoHo that included works by four choreographers: Nomi Bachar, Amy Kail, Sasha Spielvogel and Kathryn Sullivan. Most of the pieces derived from dramatic situations.
Ms. Spielvogel's ''Backstreet'' featured two guests from the Martha Graham Dance Company: Martin Lofsnes, who portrayed an alcoholic, and Elizabeth Auclair, who represented a power that restored him to sobriety. The choreography, though occasionally long-winded, was always clear and effectively contrasted the frenzied staggers of Mr. Lofsnes's character with the eternal calm radiated by Ms. Auclair.
Ms. Sullivan's ''Femme Debout (Woman Standing)'' was a brief but vivid solo in which Rachel Grisi struggled to stand tall and reach high. And Ms. Sullivan sent dancers happily cavorting in her ''Yidel Mitn Fiedel and Other Favorites,'' set to recorded swing music heard on New York Yiddish radio stations during the 1940's.
The ideas in several other dances did not always appear fully developed. Sarah Young and Ms. Bachar represented two aspects of a woman waiting to hear from a lover in Ms. Bachar's ''Telephone Call,'' inspired by a Dorothy Parker story. Their gestures were well timed, but neither as funny nor as sad as Parker's words, read on tape by Ms. Bachar.
In ''Living Room'' Ms. Bachar again divided a single character into dancing alter egos (Kate Francis and Ms. Young). The narrative was cloudy, yet Michael Kramer was amusing as this split personality's fussy father.
Ms. Kail's ''Measure'' was a terse solo for Frenchy Haynes based on a few strong pointing gestures. But the off-balance movements in Ms. Kail's ''Off the Pier'' and the restless ones in her ''One Nite'' remained dramatically vague.
