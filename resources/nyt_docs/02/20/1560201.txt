WITH a vibrant downtown of graceful Art Deco buildings and broad sun-dappled boulevards lined with palms and willowy bottle brush trees, St. Petersburg stands out in Florida's seemingly homogenous sprawl of malls, megastores and clogged interstates. Yet for all its wealth of charm and sunshine, Tampa's twin city suffers a periodic identity crisis. Named in 1892 after the hometown of a Russian railroad magnate who helped develop it, St. Petersburg was long known for its Old World character as well as for the white-haired legions who occupied green benches along the streets and boulevards. In an image upgrade, the green benches were removed, and a local landmark, the ramshackle Million Dollar Pier, was torn down in 1967 and replaced in 1973 by a charmless steel and glass structure known simply as the Pier. Nearby St. Petersburg Beach took the image remaking a step farther in 1994 and officially changed its name to the more zingy St. Pete Beach. Despite these efforts to reverse the aging process, remnants of old St. Petersburg remain, including the Sunken Gardens flora sanctuary and a sleepy complex that must make the image boosters cringe: the St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club.

Friday
5:30 p.m.  1. Cocktails at Sunset  Built for $1.5 million in 1928, the Don CeSar Beach Resort (3400 Gulf Boulevard, 727-360-1881), the luxury hotel that was called the Pink Palace for its flamingo-hued extravagance, attracted the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt and F. Scott Fitzgerald before it was ravaged by depression and war and abandoned in 1969. Restored to glory in 1973, the hotel has returned to A-list grandeur and recently added ''a Loews Hotel'' to its name. At sunset it lures celebrities and regular folk alike to its Seaporch Cafe, where a chalkboard over the bar notes the time of sunset and the phase of the moon.
8 p.m.  2. Go Fish  St. Petersburg is in the middle of the Mullet Latitudes, the globe-spanning band of warm water that is so-called because it teems not with good ol' boys with funny haircuts but with the popular sport fish. Even so, the most popular catch of the day is by far the grouper, a succulent white fish pan seared or oven roasted to perfection ($21.95) at Bertoni (709 Gulf Way, 727-363-1998), an Italian restaurant in lovely Pass-a-Grille, a leafy section of St. Pete Beach nestled between the Gulf of Mexico and the waters of the Intracoastal Waterway.
10 p.m.  3. Beach Bar Bingo  St. Pete Beach and the adjoining beach towns of Treasure Island, Madeira, Redington, Indian Rocks and Clearwater, have numerous beachfront bars, lounges and tiny tikis that offer live music. Among the most popular is the Hurricane (807 Gulf Way, 727-360-9558), a gabled three-level bar and restaurant in Pass-a-Grille that has a D.J. and dancing on Fridays and Saturdays. Go easy on the margaritas if you stand in one of the lookout towers on the Hurricane Watch Rooftop. The sweeping view of moonlit sand and sea can be dizzying enough.
Saturday
9 a.m.  4. Foodies  Downtown St. Petersburg's north-south dividing line, Central Avenue, is closed to traffic at its bayfront terminus every weekend to accommodate the Saturday Morning Market (Central Avenue between First and Second Streets, 727-455-4921), a street-food fair where local growers, chefs and bakers offer samples that are hard to resist. At one stand, red potatoes, red onions and assorted herbs sizzle in a frying pan. Nearby, teenagers help their father pile fresh-picked corn on a wood-burning grill for a roast. At the Desserts by Milly kiosk, a friendly woman offers passersby tastes of her ethereal peach cobbler.
10 a.m.  5. Sanctuary  A short stroll north along the waterfront from Central Avenue brings you to the Pier, which looks like an aircraft carrier under construction and houses the city aquarium and an assortment of shops and cafes. Nearby at the foot of the Pier, one would be hard pressed to find a finer looking public restroom than the Romanesque-style brick structure known locally as ''Little St. Mary's.'' According to legend, the designer of the actual St. Mary Our Lady of Grace, an impressive church on Fifth Avenue at Fourth Street South, felt slighted in a dispute with the church and designed the public lavatory as a scaled-down replica of the real thing.
Noon  6. Splendor Redux  Another venerable hotel, which opened three years before the Don CeSar and has had a similar fate, the Renaissance Vinoy Resort and Golf Club (501 Fifth Avenue Northeast; 727-894-1000) served as a training ground for police SWAT units as recently as the 1980's. Now restored to its prewar splendor, it has numerous bars and restaurants, including the Alfresco, known for its lobster and conch fritters ($6.95).
2 p.m.  7. In Search of Kerouac  A quick auto tour of St. Petersburg's northern neighborhoods becomes a visit to the premakeover city as you pass the quiet, shaded courts of the St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club (559 Mirror Lake Drive North, 727-822-2083), and the Sunken Gardens (1825 Fourth Street North, 727-551-3100), a green sanctuary filled with tropical trees and plants that flourish below street level in what legend has made into a sinkhole, but more likely was a small lake. A few blocks away is the Flamingo Sports Bar (1230 Ninth Street North, 727-894-9191), a cinder-block pool hall where the Beat avatar Jack Kerouac drank his last days away.
3 p.m.  8. Sir Unreal  The city that is home to the Home Shopping Network embraces an even more surreal entity: the Salvador Dalí Museum (1000 Third Street South, 727-823-3767). This year, downtown is festooned with banners proclaiming the city's celebration of the centennial of the artist's birth. An American businessman and friend of Dalí, A. Reynolds Morse, chose the city as a home for his Dalí collection. The museum has more than 90 oils and over 1,000 other eye- and mind-bending creations.
5 p.m.  9. On the Boardwalk  A sunset pub crawl from one thatch-roofed beachfront tiki bar to the next is made possible by a paved boardwalk that runs the length of Treasure Island and St. Pete Beach, where the soft, powdery sand stretches 100 yards to the lapping waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
8 p.m.  10. Grouper Groupies  Dockside Dave's Bar and Grill in Madeira Beach (13203 Gulf Boulevard, 727-392-9399) is known as the place locals go for seafood. A nondescript diner-size restaurant next to a marina, Dave's is famous for black grouper served as a half-pound sandwich ($8.95) or as an entree ($11.95).
10 p.m.  11. Breakout Hits  The Ringside Cafe (2742 Fourth Street North, 727-894-8465), a standout among the city's many live music spots, occupies a space that was once a boxing gym. One local favorite heard warbling a jaunty country punk drinking song titled ''Girl From Immokalee'' mysteriously calls himself Raiford Starke -- the names of two Florida towns where there are prisons.
Sunday
9:30 a.m.  12. Lucky Dolphins  Once a haven for real-life pirates of the Caribbean, the waters around St. Pete Beach are now filled with all manner of machine-powered boats and ships. But they are still best cruised as José Gaspar, the buccaneer of Florida legend, plied them -- under sail. A pair of ketches docked at the Dolphin Landings Charter Boat Center in St. Pete Beach (4737 Gulf Boulevard, 737-367-4488) take visitors out on Boca Ciega Bay for two-hour dolphin watches. To see a sleek and graceful dolphin at play in a boat's wake is considered good luck.
