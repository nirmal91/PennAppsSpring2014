Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Queens Democrat, yesterday withdrew his request to use funds from his Congressional campaign committee for a possible run for mayor. Legislation pending before the City Council would prohibit such use, and Mr. Weiner, left, who has about $1.8 million in a federal campaign committee, had asked the city's Campaign Finance Board last month for an opinion on whether he could transfer the cash to a city committee before the new rules took effect. But yesterday, he withdrew the request. In a letter to the board, Mr. Weiner, who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, cited ''uncertainties surrounding the transfer provisions of the new legislation.'' The city's proposed prohibition on transfers, part of a larger bill that would overhaul the campaign finance system, has drawn opposition from candidates and public-interest groups that argue that it could not be applied fairly.

Correction:  February 25, 2004, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Metro Briefing column on Friday about Representative Anthony D. Weiner's withdrawal of a query to the New York City Campaign Finance Board misstated the question he had asked. It was how he could use congressional campaign money for a mayoral campaign without violating pending city legislation barring such uses. He did not ask for the board's permission to do so.
