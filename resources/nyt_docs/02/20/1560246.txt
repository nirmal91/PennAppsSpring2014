Mayor Richard M. Daley says he will have ''no problem'' with Cook County's issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But the possibility is not immediately in sight.
Mr. Daley, in response to a journalist's question on Wednesday, went on to defend gay and lesbian couples from accusations that they were trying to undermine marriage.
''Marriage has been undermined by divorce,'' he said. ''So don't tell me about marriage. People should look at their own life and look into their own mirror.''
David Orr, the county clerk, has said he supports issuing marriage certificates for same-sex couples. But Scott Burnham, a spokesman for the clerk's office, said Mr. Orr did not intend to begin issuing such licenses yet. Illinois law recognizes only heterosexual marriages, Mr. Burnham said, and therefore the county clerk will turn away gay couples seeking marriage licenses.
Tom Tunney, Chicago's first openly gay alderman, said the mayor's statements, though welcome, might have come at a bad time. Mr. Tunney said other measures, including a state law protecting gays from discrimination, should be in place before the county issued same-sex marriage licenses.
