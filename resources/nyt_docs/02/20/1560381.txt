More than 160,000 gas grills have been recalled because glass covers on the temperature gauges have shattered, federal officials said. The manufacturer, the Grand Hall Enterprise Company, of Taiwan, announced the recall along with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Some of the glass covers have broken when moisture got inside the gauges. The grills were sold nationwide from April 2001 to December 2002 under the brand names Bakers &amp; Chefs, Members Mark and Kenmore. The company urged consumers to call (888) 735-5709, toll free, for a free replacement temperature gauge or a repair kit.
