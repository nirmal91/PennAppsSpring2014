Postmaster General John E. Potter asked Congress for nearly $800 million to help the Postal Service to install systems to detect biological agents and poisons and for ventilation and filtration in its hundreds of mail handling centers. ''Under the president's budget,'' Mr. Potter said, ''no funding is recommended for the Postal Service's efforts to improve the safety and security of the nation's mail system.''
