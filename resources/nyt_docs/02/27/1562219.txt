The government said it would expropriate selected white-owned farms for redistribution to those on a huge waiting list of black applicants, saying the current land reform program had failed to meet the demand of 240,000 Namibians waiting for property. Prime Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said the program, which relied on the willingness of white farmers to sell their property, was plagued by arbitrarily inflated land prices and a cumbersome bureaucracy. Whites comprise about 5 percent of Namibia's 1.8 million people but own most of the farmland.
