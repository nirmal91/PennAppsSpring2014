President Bush's campaign took its first concrete steps to begin its advertising campaign on Thursday. It reserved time on cable networks like CNN, Fox News Channel and Fox Sports, a home for Nascar races.
The purchase indicates that the initial effort will be highly focused and sustained. Nascar, for instance, is hugely popular among white men.
The campaign said this week that its blitz would formally begin on March 4, but gave few other details. Executives at networks said the president's strategists had reserved time from early March through May.
Television executives estimated the purchase to be at least $4 million. One strategist added that it would exceed that figure if Mr. Bush reserved time on the Golf Channel and ESPN, as Democrats expect him to do. A spokesman for Mr. Bush's campaign, Scott Stanzel, declined to comment.
Mr. Bush's media strategists have inquired about buying broadcast television time in 50 markets in 17 states, including Florida and Wisconsin, in which Mr. Bush and Al Gore were within five or six percentage points of each other in 2000.
In buying cable time, the team is focusing on a slightly older audience that is widely considered well informed. Although Fox News is generally thought to be more popular with conservatives than its competitors, network research has shown the cable news audience to be slightly more populist and conservative than those watching other programming.
