To the Editor:
Re ''A Primary Endorsement'' (editorial, Feb. 26):
I've been working as a volunteer at phone banks calling voters around the country. When I called supporters of George W. Bush, they are die-hard and passionate for their candidate.
But I've never talked to a single voter who is inspired by John Kerry. Like Robert F. Kennedy, John Edwards inspires passion and hope in people, and after Sept. 11, that's what we need.
Senator Edwards also attracts independents and Republicans. I have a friend in Connecticut who is a registered Republican who is switching parties to vote for John Edwards.
Your choice was predictable. Democrats have to think of this race as a tactical chess game: who can best beat George W. Bush? Who inspires people? Who is the better campaigner and debater?
The answer is obvious.
