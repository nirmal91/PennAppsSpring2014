High cocoa prices, a weak dollar and the effects of SARS on Asian business reduced Nestlé's 2003 profit by almost 18 percent, the company said on Thursday.
Nestlé, the world's biggest food conglomerate, said its consolidated profit for 2003 slipped to 6.2 billion Swiss francs, or $5 billion, compared with 7.56 billion Swiss francs in 2002, when its shares outperformed the Swiss market index.
Sales declined slightly, by 1.3 percent, to 87.98 billion Swiss francs, or $69.85 billion.
Nestlé, based in Vevey, Switzerland, reported earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 11 billion Swiss francs in 2003, slightly below analyst and company expectations, but ahead of the 10.9 billion Swiss franc in 2002.
Analysts said Nestlé's revenue growth excluding acquisitions of 5.1 percent in 2003 was slightly lower than company and market expectations of 5.4 percent.
Nestlé's chief executive, Peter Brabeck, said that the company had performed well despite the odds.
''This is a strong performance in an adverse economic and political environment, with powerful currency headwinds for the third successive year,'' Mr. Brabeck said in a statement.
The company said that it was ahead in the cost-cutting drive begun in 1997, saving 1.15 billion Swiss francs last year, 45 percent more than it expected.
Growth in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East outpaced Nestlé's average growth, spurred by sales of chocolate, coffee powder, breakfast cereals, ice cream and chilled foods, the company said.
Nestlé's share price fell 3.2 percent in Zurich, to 335 Swiss francs, but analysts said the decline was more a result of profit taking after an upswing in the stock in recent months rather than investor disappointment.
''The company is seen by investors as very, very solid and the investment community is very sensitive to any small slight change,'' said Paolo Mazzoni, an analyst in Zurich.
