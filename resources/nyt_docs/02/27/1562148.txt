To the Editor:
In ''Calling the Kettle Black'' (column, Feb. 25), Nicholas D. Kristof says, ''Anyone who goes to Israel feels the gut fear of bombings that drive such policies, but anyone who goes to Gaza or the West Bank sees the humiliations that spawn bombings and a vicious cycle of violence.''
I am unaware of any ''humiliation'' exemption to the legal and moral prohibitions against the murder of children and the elderly.
I am also unaware of any legal or moral system in which murder is mitigated when it occurs during a land dispute.
To imply that the right of a Palestinian to walk from one end of his olive grove to another is equivalent to the right of an Israeli child to grow up unmaimed, or to grow up at all, suggests that the life of a Jewish child is worth less than the life of any other human being.
