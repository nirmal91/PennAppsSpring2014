A front-page article on Saturday about an increase in noise complaints linked to musicians' increasing use of their apartments as recording studios referred incorrectly in some copies to GarageBand music software from Apple Computer. It is included on new computers, but it is not included with stand-alone purchases of the new Mac operating system. The article also misstated the date of the earliest home recordings. Although the trend became widespread in the 1970's, there were earlier pioneers, like Les Paul in the late 1930's.
