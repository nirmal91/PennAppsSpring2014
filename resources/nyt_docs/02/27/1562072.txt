The president of Macedonia, Boris Trajkovski, a leader known for calming ethnic tension in a country that almost descended into full-blown civil war in 2001, was missing and presumed killed Thursday in an airplane crash in mountains in Bosnia.
Mr. Trajkovski was traveling with eight other passengers and crew members, heading to a conference in Mostar, Bosnia.
Officials of Bosnia's aviation agency said the small propeller-driven plane lost radio contact just after 8 a.m. local time, as it was nearing Mostar.
The plane was thought to have gone down near the town of Stolac, in an area still heavily mined from the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
The officials said that the cause of the crash was unknown but that visibility had been poor.
Bad weather had prompted Albania's representative, Fatos Nano, to cancel his flight to the conference.
Politicians from all over Europe, including the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, issued statements mourning the loss of Mr. Trajkovski, a 47-year-old former Methodist minister who was elected president in November 1999.
Mr. Trajkovski had made his reputation as the deputy foreign minister for his handling of an enormous influx of refugees from neighboring Kosovo during NATO's bombings of Yugoslavia.
In 2001, he helped to prevent an uprising by Albanian rebels in Macedonia from turning into all-out civil war.
''He was the most important Macedonian figure in preventing a civil war, and that has never been fully recognized,'' said Mark Laity, a news media adviser to NATO's supreme allied commander.
