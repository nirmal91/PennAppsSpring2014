More than 60 drivers in the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn awoke yesterday to find tires on their vehicles slashed, the police said. The first call came to the police at 7:20 a.m., from Rutland Road between Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, east of Prospect Park, the police said. The heaviest concentration of damaged vehicles appeared to be on those three blocks, with others scattered through the area, the police said. A few of the vehicles also had had their windshields broken. Investigators had no description of a suspect or suspects.
