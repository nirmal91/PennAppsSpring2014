The French insurance company AXA delivered strong annual results for 2003 on cost-cutting measures and good results from its property and casualty department. The company, based in Paris, said its net income increased 6 percent in 2003 to 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion), while operating profit, which excluded Sept. 11 claims and capital gains, rose 21 percent to 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion). The insurer's property and casualty division however rose 233 percent to 753 million euros ($935 million) on lower claims and rate increases. Helped by those results, AXA, which has bid $1.5 billion for the Mony Group, the New York-based insurer, is looking at takeover opportunities in markets where it already has a strong presence, the chief executive, Henri de Castries, said.
