An off-duty police officer caught a man suspected of robbing a bank in Brooklyn, after the officer, in line in the bank, chased the suspect, the police said. The suspect, Anthony Aponick, 32, had just fled a branch of the Greenpoint Savings Bank at 7120 New Utrecht Avenue with cash he had taken from a teller at 11 a.m., the police said, when the off-duty sergeant, Angelo Russo, was told of the robbery. Sergeant Russo followed him, called other police officers for assistance on his cellphone and, with the help of two other officers, caught the suspect. Mr. Aponick, of Gravesend, was charged with robbery and criminal possession of stolen property, according to a police press statement.
