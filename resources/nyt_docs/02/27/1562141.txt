The government has raised its forecast for its economic growth this year after reporting that gross domestic product rose by an annual rate of 11 percent in the fourth quarter. Growth was fueled by rebounding shipments of electronics and pharmaceuticals, the government said. The ministry of trade and industry projected G.D.P. growth of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent this year.
