To the Editor:
I was delighted to read your Feb. 26 editorial endorsement of John Kerry. His experience gives him the qualifications not only to defeat George W. Bush but also to use the power of the Oval Office to reverse the harm to our country, people and environment caused by this administration.
As an active Democrat, I hope that my party is strengthened this year as never before.
