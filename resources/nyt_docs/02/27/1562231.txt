An obituary by The Associated Press on Jan. 22 about Harry E. Claiborne, a former federal district court judge from Nevada who went to prison in 1986 for income tax evasion, referred incorrectly to a precedent. This was not the first case in which a federal judge was sent to prison. Legal historians consider the first to be that of Martin T. Manton, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan. Judge Manton resigned in 1939 shortly before his indictment for bribery in a case before him. He was convicted and served 18 months. Judge Claiborne, who was impeached and removed from office while in prison, was the first sitting federal judge to be imprisoned for a crime committed while he was on the bench. This correction was delayed for research.
