Eircom, the telephone company once owned by the government of Ireland, will raise 300 million euros ($372 million) next month by issuing new shares on the Dublin and London stock exchanges, its parent company, Valentia Holdings, said. The sale will be Ireland's first initial offering since late 2000, and the biggest since the government sold the company, then called Telecom Eireann, in 1999. Valentia bought Eircom, which controls 80 percent of the Irish market, for 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in 2001, and its owners, the billionaires George Soros and Tony O'Reilly, and Providence Equity Partners, are expected to sell significant quantities of existing shares. Eircom, which sold its cellphone unit to Vodafone in 2001, said it might re-enter the cellular market.
