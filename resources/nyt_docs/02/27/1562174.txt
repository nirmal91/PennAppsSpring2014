In his first public appearance since dropping out of the presidential race last week, Howard Dean thanked his supporters here on Thursday night and urged them to stay with the Democratic Party and ''not to be tempted by independent or third-party candidates.''
Dr. Dean spoke in a packed hotel ballroom to an audience of whooping, clapping supporters who often acted as though their candidate were still in the race.
He did not mention Ralph Nader, who entered the presidential race a few days ago, but a number of those in the audience said they considered his remark about third-party candidates to be a clear reference to Mr. Nader.
Dr. Dean also did not say anything about endorsing another Democrat for president, but he did say, in a characteristic aside, ''My staff is absolutely terrified about what I might announce tonight.''
Instead, he urged his supporters to back the eventual Democratic nominee, and described his plans to continue influencing the race from the outside.
''Those of you who wish to support another candidate, I encourage that,'' he said, adding that he would also be happy to have his supporters vote for him in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday. ''But remember,'' he added, ''we must all stand together in the end.''
Dr. Dean said he planned to build a new organization that would draw on his campaign's grass-roots network, to be formally unveiled on March 18. Specifically, he said the new group would work to bring new people into the Democratic Party and to fight the Republicans aggressively on a number of fronts.
Unlike the tearful crowd at Dr. Dean's concession speech last week, the audience here seemed mostly undaunted by his withdrawal. Many people said they planned to vote for him in the Connecticut primary anyway.
