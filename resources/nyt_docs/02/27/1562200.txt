McKenzie Fine Art  511 West 25th Street, Chelsea  Through March 13
Faux is the domain of Jean Lowe, a San Diego-based artist whose high-camp, handmade furniture of papier-mâché takes off on the fancy Empire mode of early 19th-century décor. She has created a salon of wonderfully pompous furnishings: gilded upholstered chairs, a ''marble''-topped cabinet and table, ornamental clocks and a large imperial rug, painted on canvas, all swags and scrolls and fakey coats of arms.
In contrast, three large murals on the walls are a bit of a shock. They display not the usual 19th-century upper-caste idylls of private parks and woodlands, but scenes of Southern California malls dominated by fast food and retail emporiums, like Pizza Hut, Del Taco, Wal-Mart and Target. (When you come right down to it, the gilded furniture is no less crass than the big box stores.) Nature does show, in the form of mountains and trees, but they are at a far remove.
Also on view are six charming Rococo tabletop tableaus of Apollo and Daphne in papier-mâché, cued by Bernini's sculpture on the same theme. They are identical, but each is painted a different color, suggesting the wood it might have been made from (oak, redwood, poplar, etc.).
And in a separate display, excerpts from the library of Dr. Pohatten, a made-up psychologist, are shown in papier-mâché bookcases. Their self-help titles -- some real, most not -- range from ''The Leveraged Buyout'' and ''Insider Trading'' to ''Global Beauty Tips'' and ''Artistic Mammography.'' Ms. Lowe is a wizard at her craft, and she's wonderfully funny, too.
