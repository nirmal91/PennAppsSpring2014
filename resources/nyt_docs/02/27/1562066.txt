Re ''Beijing Says Only 'Patriots' Are Fit to Rule Hong Kong'' (news article, Feb. 21):
Beijing must learn that a legal promise of autonomy means having to accept situations it is not always happy with. Unfortunately, it is repeating in Hong Kong the mistakes it made in Tibet.
The 1951 agreement China forced on Tibet promised more autonomy than is included in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution. But Beijing soon ousted Tibet's popular joint prime ministers, effectively for their lack of patriotism toward China. The heavy-handed tactics set the stage for the 1959 Tibetan uprising.
What message is Beijing sending in Hong Kong? For the Taiwanese and for Tibetans, it seems clear: the ''one country, two systems'' model is unreliable as long as Beijing ultimately calls the shots.
