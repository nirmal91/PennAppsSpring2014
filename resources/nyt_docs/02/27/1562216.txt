Despite a pouring rain, 5,000 people gathered under umbrellas in Barcelona in a silent protest against the violent Basque separatist group E.T.A., which last week unilaterally declared a truce applicable only to Catalonia. The protest was held just before the opening of campaigning for national elections on March 14. The selective truce has become a campaign issue.
