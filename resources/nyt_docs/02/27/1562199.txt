Aidas Bareikis might be considered within the current neo-Goth vogue in contemporary New York art, but his work seems to be less about Pop attitudes than about the exuberant ghastliness of a material world in which everything is rotting and beautiful. Until now Mr. Bareikis has embodied this notion in engulfing environments. In this show, he distills it in figures.
He builds each figure around found objects, like a piece of crushed wicker furniture or a light-up plastic Christmas figure. He drapes this core structure in layers of fabrics and flea market items, spattered with paint or soaked in coffee or soy sauce, and adds animal-skull heads and hanks of fake hair. The effect is one of oddly delicate, gruesome charm.
''Lady of Tide,'' part of a three-figure group, is like a sea goddess decayed from prolonged immersion but with miniature ships swimming across her chest and toy whales down her back. ''Frog River'' is like a decomposed body adorned with a snow of tiny cutout skulls.
And speaking of young artists, be sure to check out the single painting by Justin Faunce hanging in the gallery's office. Mr. Faunce recently graduated from art school in Boston and has yet to have a New York show, though this painting is a show in itself. Titled ''Go Team,'' it is a big, complex puzzle of American history, popular culture, advertising and politics, pieced together with the kind of mind-boggling graphic detail that Lane Twitchell has brought to Mormon history. Mr. Faunce is said to work very slowly, which I can easily believe. But if he can keep producing work this good, time is on his side.
