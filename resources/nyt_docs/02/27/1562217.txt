At least 25 people died in three separate explosions across Russia, according to television and news agency reports. At least 15 people died and 17 were wounded when an explosion tore through a cafe in the Siberian city of Chita. Officials blamed a gas leak. In the southern region of Dagestan, four children died when a boiler exploded at a school and collapsed a wall. In Chechnya, six passengers died and seven others were wounded when their truck evidently struck a land mine.
