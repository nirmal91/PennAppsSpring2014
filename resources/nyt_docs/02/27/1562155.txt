To the Editor:
Your Feb. 26 editorial endorsement of John Kerry in the Democratic primary boils down to this: John Kerry has more experience, so we'll endorse him.
You note that he has had trouble articulating his ideas on the campaign trail. Is he the kind of candidate who can defeat the Bush onslaught?
While I believe that your assertion that President Bush's lack of experience hurt him after 9/11 is correct, I highly doubt that the majority of Americans share that view.
