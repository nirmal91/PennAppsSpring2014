To the Editor:
John Kerry may be the more ''experienced and knowledgeable'' candidate in the primary on March 2 (editorial, Feb. 26), but recent history has shown that likability trumps experience, particularly in a presidential election.
Republicans figured out long ago that Americans will vote for someone who speaks to them before someone who speaks down to them.
John Edwards has demonstrated the ability to communicate the Democratic agenda better than any Democrat in the United States today. A vote for John Kerry is a vote for another Dukakis-Mondale-McGovern-style embarrassment in the fall.
With the stakes so high, Democrats can't afford to make another mistake.
