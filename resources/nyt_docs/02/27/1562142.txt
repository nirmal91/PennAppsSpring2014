The British mortgage bank Abbey National said that it lost Â£644 million ($1.2 billion) in 2003 after it took charges to restructure its business. The bank is in the process of closing its wholesale unit after the business incurred large losses in 2002 to concentrate on personal finance. The chief operating officer, Stephen Hester, said profit margins in that area were hurt because the company lowered interest rates on margins, but raised rates on savings accounts to attract customers. Shares of Abbey National closed down 12 percent, the company's largest drop ever, to 485 pence, and Standard &amp; Poor's cut the bank's long-term credit rating one notch.
