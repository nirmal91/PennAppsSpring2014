Twelve Queens residents were charged yesterday with defrauding the New York State workers' compensation system of more than $172,000 from 1999 to 2003, including a factory worker who was said to have been using a motorized water scooter while claiming to be too badly injured to work. The 12 charged yesterday tried to defraud the compensation system by either submitting false claims or remaining at work while injured and receiving compensation payment, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said. One worker continued to work as a custodian while receiving payments, and another worked as a truck driver, Mr. Brown said. He said that Henryka Gorzelska, 50 , of Queens, a machine operator, was seen using the water scooter while collecting payments. Anthony Battisti, a lawyer for Ms. Gorzelska, said yesterday that she was not guilty.
