To the Editor:
Re ''So What Was That All About?'' (Week in Review, Feb. 22):
I am 24 and have been a supporter of the Howard Dean campaign since its inception.
This is the first time I have followed the course of a presidential candidacy and the first time I contributed to any political cause.
Dr. Dean's Internet campaign was savvy, but there is something more elusive to his appeal. We young voters can never have our concerns addressed if we do not become a constituency, yet most of us are sickened by the thought of a candidate who is, as Jack London put it, ''dogmatic with truth.''
Dr. Dean's policies in Vermont are solid, but the bright spark that brought us into the fold was his integrity -- a word so tarted up and belabored that it has scant meaning anymore.
