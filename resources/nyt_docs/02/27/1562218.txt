Michael Howard, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, censured one of his legislators after she wisecracked about 20 Chinese immigrants who drowned while picking cockles, a form of clam, in northwestern England three weeks ago. Mr. Howard said the party member, Ann Winterton, had declined to apologize for the remarks, made at a private dinner party. It was the second time since May 2002 that Mrs. Winterton has been disciplined for making race-related jokes.
