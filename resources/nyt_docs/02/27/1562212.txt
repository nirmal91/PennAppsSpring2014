A state district judge has refused a defense motion to postpone the murder trial of Terry L. Nichols, which is scheduled to begin Monday. The lawyers had wanted more time to examine what they said might be new evidence. Mr. Nichols is charged with 161 counts of murder in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.
