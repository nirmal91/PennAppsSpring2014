DirecTV abruptly dismissed agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Publicis Groupe yesterday to consolidate its account with agencies owned by the Omnicom Group. DirecTV, recently acquired by the News Corporation, spends about $115 million a year on advertising.
The Interpublic agency dismissed was the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Deutsch, which had created humorous campaigns for DirecTV since 2000. The Publicis agency dismissed was MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group, which had handled media planning and buying since 2001.
The BBDO Worldwide division of Omnicom in New York will take over the creative assignment. The agency recently hired as an executive creative director Eric Silver, who had worked with the new executive vice president for marketing at DirecTV, Neal Tiles, when Mr. Tiles was at Fox Sports Net and Mr. Silver was at Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners. The OMD division of Omnicom in New York will assume the media duties.
Mr. Tiles, in a statement, said the consolidation was to increase efficiency as well as to resume working with Mr. Silver.
Deutsch and MediaVest, in separate statements, said they were surprised by the sudden dismissals.
