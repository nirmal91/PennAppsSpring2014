City Council members introduced a bill yesterday that would require city health officials to provide a nurse to every public and private elementary and middle school that has at least 200 students. The bill was introduced by Councilman Michael McMahon, with the support of Council Speaker Gifford Miller and other council leaders. Many small private schools have complained that they do not have a full-time nurse available to them. City health officials have said that providing a nurse to all private elementary schools, which typically have smaller enrollments than public schools, would lead to an inequitable distribution of city resources per student.
