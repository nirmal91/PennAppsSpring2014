''The House,'' a three-screen video projection by the Finnish artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila, was something of a hit at Documenta 11, where its emotional clearness and visual lushness stood out. But the piece is not as good as ''Consolation Service'' and ''The Wind,'' seen in the artist's previous shows in New York. Seeing it again here, outside the aridness of a big international survey, I found myself paying more attention to real estate than anything else.
The main setting, a small green-trimmed gray house in the woods overlooking a harbor, is eminently covetable; its interior is a subtle symphony of grays, whites and pale blues punctuated by touches of deep red -- a cushion, the blouse of the woman who wanders through it, slowly losing her mind. Her monologue (in subtitles) reveals that she feels she is merging with her surroundings. ''I can't keep things out,'' she says.
Where Ms. Ahtila's previous works were compressed by shocking events -- people falling through ice, bookcases being hurled -- that made her plots resonate beyond their limited time spans, this tale feels drawn out and monotonous. Reality intrudes in sophomorically Surrealist ways: a car races across the wallpaper, a cow migrates from a field to the television set and right into the living room. The best sequence seems arbitrary: sliding shots of treetops in which the woman floats, suddenly airborne, as if released from her terrors, or giving in to them.
Ms. Ahtila's dual pursuit of the narrative potential of feature film and the spatial possibilities of video installation is ambitious, but more than one critic has raised the possibility that she may have to choose between them. Here, this likelihood seems likelier.
