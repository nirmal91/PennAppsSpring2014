The government's media commission called the Voice of America a national security threat, accusing the service of ''peddling lies about this country resulting in the deterioration of the Zimbabwean image.'' The commission issued the broadside as the state-controlled Daily Herald fired three journalists who had worked in second jobs for the Voice of America. Separately, South Africa's deputy president issued a muted call for greater press freedom in Zimbabwe, saying that South Africa's cacophony of media voices is ''what we would want to see in any other country.'' South Africa's foreign minister caused an outcry this month by saying that Zimbabwe's suppression of a free press was acceptable because a court had sanctioned it.
