Verisign, which assigns and administers more than half of the world's 60 million Internet addresses, filed a federal antitrust lawsuit yesterday against its regulator and nemesis, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, seeking to free itself from at least part of Icann's control. The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserts among other things that Icann has exceeded the boundaries of the contract it signed with Verisign in May 2001, authorizing Verisign to provide ''registry services'' to companies that sell domain names with the popular .com and .net suffixes, among others. In effect, Verisign says that Icann has illegally prevented it from selling services that do not fall under Icann's purview, as it is set forth in the companies' contract. ''Our contract spells out Icann's jurisdiction, and what a registry service is, but by trying to assert that essentially every service is a registry service, it has led to delays and mission creep,'' said Tom Galvin, Verisign's vice president for government relations. Representatives of Icann, which is a private nonprofit corporation, declined to comment.
