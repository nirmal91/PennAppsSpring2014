An article in The Arts yesterday about Hollywood's reaction to Mel Gibson's film ''The Passion of the Christ'' cited an executive close to David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, principals of DreamWorks, saying that the two men had privately expressed anger over the film.
The Times should have checked directly with both men and given them an opportunity to comment on the executive's statement.
Mr. Geffen said yesterday: ''Neither Jeffrey or I have seen the movie or have formed an opinion about it.''
