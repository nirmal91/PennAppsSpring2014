To the Editor:
Re ''A Primary Endorsement'' (editorial, Feb. 26):
Bravo for coming out in favor of the most electable candidate in the Democratic Party.
John Kerry is a thoughtful, courageous man who has lived his life with honor and integrity. This alone puts him far ahead of our embattled president.
John Kerry is no ''Massachusetts liberal'' and no Michael Dukakis. John Kerry is Karl Rove's worst nightmare: a candidate who can go eye to eye with the president on foreign policy and terrorism, and whose record on health care, the environment and jobs is exemplary.
About merging John Edwards and John Kerry into ''one composite super-candidate'': I believe that Senator Kerry is open to offering Senator Edwards the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
