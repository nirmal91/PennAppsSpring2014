To the Editor:
One reason John Kerry deserves your Feb. 26 editorial endorsement is that he bridges the divide in the Vietnam generation.
We are brothers, one of whom (Peter) served as a captain in the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, while the other (John) was part of the national antiwar leadership.
Both of us strongly support John Kerry as the candidate who takes seriously the challenge to restore integrity to our country's role in the world. If anything, America's reputation is more compromised today than it was during the Vietnam War.
Then as now, the question is not what one thinks about an issue, but how one faces life choices.
John Kerry's record is equally a rebuff to those who supported the Vietnam War but who felt that someone else should do the fighting as it is to those who opposed it and would not take the risk to protest.
With implications for how the United States ends the Bush administration's debacle in Iraq, Senator Kerry also led Congressional support for normal relations with postwar Vietnam, recognizing that the accomplishment of real peace and reconciliation is an important and substantial process.
