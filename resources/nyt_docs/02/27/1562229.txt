Frederick W. McCarthy, who confessed to a role in the Connecticut treasury scandal, was sentenced to a year and a day in federal court yesterday. Mr. McCarthy was the chairman of an investment firm that hired friends of Connecticut's former state treasurer, Paul J. Silvester, in exchange for state business. Mr. McCarthy, 62, pleaded guilty in September to giving $1 million consulting contracts to an associate of Mr. Silvester and his mistress to reward Mr. Silvester for investing $200 million of state pension money with Triumph Capital Group, his family's firm. Prosecutors recommended 15 months. But Judge Ellen Bree Burns reduced that after Mr. McCarthy's lawyers spoke about his charitable giving. Mr. McCarthy could serve as little as 10 1/2 months with good behavior.
