To the Editor:
In ''Calling the Kettle Black'' (column, Feb. 25), Nicholas D. Kristof tries to present a balanced picture of the hypocrisy in the Middle East but falls short when he uses the phrase ''Palestinian lands'' instead of a more accurate term like ''disputed territory.''
At the very least, Israel and the Palestinians have an equal claim to the West Bank and Gaza.
The term ''Palestinian lands'' is unsupported by the legal history and status of the region.
