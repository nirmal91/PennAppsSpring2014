The authorities are investigating an envelope containing white powder and a threat to State Senator Gloria Romero that was mailed from Salinas Valley State Prison. Ms. Romero recently held hearings on the conduct of corrections officers in the prison system. A letter in the envelope, intercepted in a routine check, ''suggested that she needed to be concerned for her safety,'' said Commissioner D. O. Helmick of the State Highway Patrol. Mr. Helmick said the powder was found to be a ''cleaning agent or salt.''
