A man whose rape conviction was overturned on DNA evidence after he spent more than 16 years in Louisiana prisons has sued the City of Baton Rouge and some police officers who were involved in his case. The man, Gene Bibbins, 47, and his daughter contend that the authorities fabricated and hid evidence to convict him of the 1986 rape of a 13-year-old girl in a housing project.
