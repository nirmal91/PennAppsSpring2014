A man was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison after he admitted that he sexually assaulted his girlfriend's 8-year-old daughter, who became pregnant. The man, Chancellor Drayton, 44, of Queens, pleaded guilty on Feb. 3 to a charge of sexual conduct with a child under age 11. Mr. Drayton admitted engaging in sexual acts with the child at his residence between December 2001 and October 2002, which caused the child to become pregnant, the Queens district attorney's office said. Mr. Drayton, a street vendor, was sentenced before Justice Barry Kron.
