More than 400,000 nonbusiness users of the E-ZPass electronic toll system will be charged a $1 monthly surcharge beginning in May because of reduced traffic after the Sept. 11 terror attack, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said. The authority expects to raise more than $5 million to partly offset the $31 million it costs to operate the system, Ken Philmus, the authority's director of tunnels, bridges and terminals, said in an interview yesterday. The authority's 15,000 business customers, who already pay $23.50 for each tag, will not pay the fee.
