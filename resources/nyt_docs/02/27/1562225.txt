Eight fuel cells will convert waste gases into energy to help provide power, and eliminate odors, at four sewage treatment plants in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday. The 200-kilowatt fuel cells are designed to operate on the gaseous byproducts of the wastewater-treatment process, producing electricity and heat through a chemical reaction.
