The state attorney general, Peg Lautenschlager, arrested for drunken driving on Monday night, pleaded guilty to the charge yesterday. Ms. Lautenschlager, who apologized for a ''terrible mistake,'' refused to take a blood test on the night of her arrest, but a breath test indicated that she had a blood alcohol level of .12. Ms. Lautenschlager said she would pay any related fines and submit to any other penalty, like license revocation.
