An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the opening of Borders bookstores in Detroit and Chicago referred incorrectly to development in downtown Detroit. The headquarters building of the Compuware Corporation, the site of a new Borders store, is the third new office building to be built there since the 1970's, not the first. The article also referred incorrectly to the availability of T-shirts for sale in the area. They are indeed available, at stores that sell souvenirs and sundries.
