Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about snowboarding at Mountain Creek in northwestern New Jersey misstated the character of the area around Route 23, a highway nearby. It is not heavily industrial or commercial, and does not have concrete noise barriers. That description applied to highway sections in eastern New Jersey, which were part of the drive from Manhattan.
