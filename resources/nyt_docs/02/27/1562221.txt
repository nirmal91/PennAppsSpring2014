A judge concluded the yearlong treason trial of Zimbabwe's main opposition leader but indicated that a verdict was, at best, months away. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is accusing of conspiring to assassinate he country's autocratic ruler, Robert Mugabe. Mr. Tsvangirai's backers say he was framed. He could face the death penalty if convicted, but some independent legal observers say they anticipate that he will eventually be acquitted on technical grounds.
