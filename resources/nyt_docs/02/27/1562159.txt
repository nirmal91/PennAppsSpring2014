Defending Champion Leads in Tucson
Frank Lickliter II, the defending Chrysler Classic of Tucson champion, had four straight birdies late in the first round yesterday and finished with a nine-under-par 63 to begin his title defense with a two-shot lead.
Lickliter nearly had company at the top. Per-Ulrik Johansson had an eagle, eight birdies and a bogey through 17 holes. Then he pushed a 3-wood off the tee into the water on the right of the last hole. After a drop and his approach, Johansson three-putted from 36 feet for a double-bogey 6 that left him two strokes behind.

TENNIS
Venus Williams Loses in Dubai
Venus Williams was beaten, 6-2, 6-3, in the Dubai Open quarterfinals yesterday by the unseeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, who is ranked 28th in the world. The second-seeded Williams was playing in her first tournament in three weeks after a right leg injury. She returned to the WTA circuit at last month's Australian Open after a six-month layoff.
''I'm just out of practice,'' Williams said after a match in which she served poorly and made numerous unforced errors. Top-ranked Justine Henin-Hardenne reached the semifinals, routing eighth-seeded Conchita Mart√≠nez, 6-1, 6-0. (AP)

SQUASH
Englishman Retains Title
Top-seeded Peter Nicol of England retained his title last night by beating John White of Scotland, 15-10, 17-15, 15-12, in the Bear Stearns Tournament of Champions in Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Terminal.
In a grueling match that covered 65 minutes, Nicol needed a tie breaker to win the second game, then blew a 12-5 lead in the third game as the second-seeded White forged a 12-12 tie before three untimely errors led to Nicol's victory. It was Nicol's third title in the last four years.
