IT took Richard Yancey seven years to earn his undergraduate degree in English. Law school didn't take. (He dropped out after a year.) Neither did teaching, playwriting or ranching. So, at 28, with a fianc√©e who was wondering if he would ever grow up, he took a far different career turn: he joined the Internal Revenue Service. Specifically, he became one of those I.R.S. agents who collect money from ''D.B.'s,'' the agents' term for deadbeats, or people who fall behind on their tax payments.
In ''Confessions of a Tax Collector: One Man's Tour of Duty Inside the I.R.S.'' (Harper Collins, $24.95), Mr. Yancey describes his 12 years with the agency. He relates everything from his on-the-job training by a General Patton-type manager who wishes he could carry a gun to his own slow but steady evolution into someone who could close down a four-person woodworking shop for failure to pay payroll taxes and seize homes of the seriously tax delinquent without losing sleep.
Mr. Yancey's prose is always entertaining. ''My fingerprints were now on file with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,'' he writes. ''I would never be able to commit a felony with any spontaneity and get away with it. For every door that opens, another one closes.''
And the abuses by agents that he outlines -- threats and illegal searches among them -- are mostly a thing of the past, thanks to Congressional reform.
Still, if you read this book, you may well want to double-check your tax return one more time before sending it in.
