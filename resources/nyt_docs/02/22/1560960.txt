A livery cab driver was struck and killed yesterday morning by a hit-and-run driver while changing a tire, the authorities said.
The victim, whom the police identified as Roman Jozwiak, 45, of Clifton, N.J., was beside his 1996 sedan around 5 a.m. on an exit ramp at Woodhaven Boulevard on the eastbound side of the Long Island Expressway in Queens, the police said.
A passing vehicle struck Mr. Jozwiak. A police official said that the hit-and-run driver might have been trying to hurry across the spur to make it onto the exit ramp and failed to see the livery car driver.
Mr. Jozwiak was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police found a bent jack. There was damage to the livery car, which a police spokesman said may have been caused by a sideswipe or by Mr. Jozwiak's being thrown against his car.
Mr. Jozwiak's sisters-in-law, Kristina Szczepankowska, 53, and Stanislawa Orozco, 45, said that Mr. Jozwiak's wife, Jadwiga, 41, and their son, Mariusz , 11, and daughter, Bata, 6, live in Poland. The sisters both live in New Jersey.
Mrs. Orozco said that she called her sister in Poland yesterday to tell her the news.
''She's so depressed. She said, 'This world is over. This world is over,' because for her he is everything.''
There was a female passenger in the back seat of the livery car, but a Police Department official said that the woman did not see the impact and that she might have been asleep.
