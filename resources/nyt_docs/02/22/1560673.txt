I read with great interest the letters relating the revulsion and horror of many readers that resulted from reading your article on sexual slavery. I, too, share their feelings concerning this crime against women and girls.
However, I was struck by the ad, across from the letters page, featuring a man and a woman. The woman is dressed in latex thigh-high stockings, suggesting sado-masochism, and is wearing high-heeled sandals. Her leg is held in a posture of domination by the man. The image was shot from the waist down. By omitting the faces of the models, they have become dehumanized and objectified. What exactly is the ad trying to sell?
Until our popular culture, especially in the areas of advertising, music, movies, fashion and television, stops promoting the image of women as sexual objects, the sex-slave industry and all of its abhorrent and attendant exploitation and crime will continue to flourish.
