All right, ladies, you can come out now. After years of monochromatic minimalism and flea-market camp, ladylike is back. The new politesse is all over the runways, and it's marching, with head high and spine erect, onto the home front too.
The look, which draws its inspiration from original sources (18th-century neo-Classicism, Chinese Chippendale) as well as 20th-century pastiche (Hollywood Regency), has waxed and waned over the years. Ladylike design reached a high point in the insouciant, modernized neo-Classicism of Jean-Michel Frank in the 1930's and in Dorothy Draper's Hollywood Baroque of the 1940's. By the 1950's, such elegant refinement gave way to a more mass-market girly craze: think wallpaper adorned with French poodles and Eiffel Towers.
Today, design aficionados are seeing a renewed interest in the hallmarks of ladylike decorating, from toile and damask fabrics to chinoiserie in furniture and accessories, to confectionery colors like lavender, apple green and pink that recall the brothers Adam. And to validate all this, ''The House in Good Taste,'' the 1914 book by Elsie de Wolfe -- the quintessential ''lady decorator'' -- is being reprinted this year.
For the ladylike look, do try this at home: classical ornament, floral prints, pert little chairs - and always think pink.
This is your grandmother's decorating, but with plenty of attitude and a livelier, more saturated color palette.
