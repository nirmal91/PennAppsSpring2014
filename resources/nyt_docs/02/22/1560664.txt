I was unimpressed with the ethical arguments advanced by virus writers. Those who invent worms and e-mail them to antivirus companies in the hope of improving cybersecurity remind me of folks who set fires and then call 911. Even the most well intentioned among these young people are playing a dangerous game. A reckless act is not protected speech.
