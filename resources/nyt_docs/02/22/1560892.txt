THE bustle of Fifth Avenue fades as you mount the steps to the upper sanctum of Nat Sherman's. On the second floor of what seems like a modest-size cigar store at 42nd Street is a refuge vast in spirit for cigar smokers, an area that welcomes them (and Nat Sherman cigar buyers). There is peace here, along with leather club chairs, antique sports memorabilia and wreaths of smoke.
New York's current antismoking law (not to mention the weather) makes one yearn for such a refuge. In truth, cigar-smoking was never easy in public establishments. While the law does allow for a handful of cigar bars, and Nat Sherman's has long welcomed actual smokers, being beleaguered is also a state of mind. The Nat Sherman smoke-safe zone beckoned.
So we passed the walk-in humidor, my colleague Paul von Zielbauer and I, where prosperous men with slicked-back hair and wire-rim glasses sat talking about the Nasdaq and cigar sizes. It was humid in there. Lockers hold individual stashes of cigars and many a liquor bottle. We reached another room, quieter and smaller, disturbed only by CNBC on a flat-screen television. Newspapers hung from a rack.
We settled in. A pair of friends, Joe Rivello of Maspeth, Queens, and Timothy Irons of Midtown, who are institutional equity salesmen, took the other two wingbacks. Mr. Rivello said worries about finding a place to smoke because of the current law brought them to the Nat Sherman smoking floor. Also, his wife won't let him smoke at home. But they were really there because of Amanda Elizabeth Rivello, who was born on Nov. 23. ''We're celebrating my bull-market baby,'' Mr. Rivello said.
