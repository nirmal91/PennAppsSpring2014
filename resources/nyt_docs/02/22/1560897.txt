To the Editor:
Those who fail to reply to invitations marked R.S.V.P. aren't the problem, since they also don't show up. The problem is those who do respond but don't show up. Many view a ''yes'' not as a commitment but as an option, agreeing to multiple events in order to be able to decide at the last minute which to attend. They also don't call to cancel and if pressed will invent an excuse instead of providing an honest apology.
I entertain frequently, and my solution is to stop inviting these people. On several occasions I have been asked why others were invited and they were not. I explain that their previous actions had negative consequences, and I refuse to allow their lack of consideration to compromise my party planning.
Have I lost any friends from this? Never. I have occasionally forfeited people who claimed to be my friends but were too self-centered to realize that they were not friendly. And that's no loss.
