When Seun Lim, a clothing designer in Los Angeles, gained weight last year, she decided to make blue jeans that would conceal the extra pounds. She came up with James Preserved Denim, figure-flattering jeans that landed at the Beverly Hills branch of Barneys New York last month. Within a week, the first shipment of 1,100 James jeans sold out. A second delivery of 7,500 has since arrived. The jeans, at $130 to $150, use a few optical illusions to thinning effect. The back pockets are positioned and angled to make the backside appear smaller and higher; a darker rinse on the inside of the thighs makes legs seem leaner. Whiskering around the fly front is short, so hips appear narrower. And denim highlights that usually start midcalf begin above the knee, so the lower leg seems longer and thinner. While James jeans may offer clemency to saddlebags, their greatest appeal lies in the fact that in a sea of faddish topstitching, Lycra stretch and sunburst seams, they are coolly simple and unadorned -- real jeans for real-shaped people.
