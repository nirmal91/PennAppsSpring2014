Griggstown Quail Farm in Princeton started out in the 1970's with 12 quail; within only a few years it had 12,000 birds and was supplying hundreds a week to haute restaurants in New York City, among them Lut√®ce and the Four Seasons. For the last 10 years the farm has also been supplying game birds to the country's leading purveyor, D'Artagnan, in Newark. Then, last year, Joan and George Rude, the owners of the farm, opened a retail store so the public could buy the same locally raised, all-natural birds that top-name chefs do.
In addition to quail, the Rudes raise mallard and muscovy duck, pheasant, chicken, turkey and poussin (baby chicken). Some birds are available seasonally, not all year round. Their most expensive offerings include a heritage breed of turkey called Bourbon Red (an average $80 a bird) and the mallard duck ($15.50 each). About one pound each, a whole poussin ($4.25) makes an impressive presentation at a dinner party and is far more tender and tasty than a Cornish hen.
The Rudes have hired a young chef, Matt Systema, to churn out rotisserie chickens, fruit pies and other sweet treats (oatmeal raisin cookies, for example, three for $1) and potpies ($12 each). The all-natural potpies -- chicken or turkey -- are filled with hunks of light and dark meat and weigh in at a hefty 2 1/2 pounds each. The pies are encased in buttery puff pastry, and the filling is rounded out with onions, celery, turnips, cremini mushrooms, carrots, fennel, peas and homemade stock.
