To the Editor:
A Feb. 15 letter writer (''Zimbabwe's Health Crisis'') says ''spending per head on health care in Zimbabwe fell by a third from 1990 to 1996'' under an International Monetary Fund program. In fact, health spending there increased in the 1990's.
During the most recent period of extended I.M.F. support for Zimbabwe (1992-95), government spending on health increased as a share of total public expenditure (from 6.5 percent to 10.1 percent), and in per capita terms adjusted for inflation, it rose on average 15 percent a year.
The International Monetary Fund is deeply concerned about Zimbabwe's economic deterioration over the last four to five years. In particular, high inflation, shrinking agricultural production and H.I.V.-AIDS have taken a severe toll on the population.
During the latest annual discussions with the Zimbabwean authorities in 2003, I.M.F. staff highlighted the need to maintain critical public services, in particular in health and education.
