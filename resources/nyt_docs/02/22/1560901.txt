To the Editor:
Re: ''A Scorned Plan Seeks to Undo Needles and the Damage Done'' (Feb. 15), about proposed needle exchanges in Queens: The article states that such exchanges would need waivers from the Department of Health because it is illegal in New York State to hand out syringes without prescriptions.
However, in 2000, the New York Assembly made it legal to sell up to 10 syringes without a prescription at pharmacies. It is crucial that addicts, particularly in communities where there has been opposition to needle exchange programs, be made aware of this law so they can protect themselves from H.I.V.
