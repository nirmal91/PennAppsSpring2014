In defending The Times against its Deanite critics, you fall back on the na√Øve notion that what The Times does is simply educate the electorate rather than shape the actual political terrain that candidates and voters must negotiate. Along with the rest of the news media, it does a lot of the latter, as all campaigns know.
Worse, you fail to confront The Times's own power. The fact is that one Times story goes a long way: were not the TV news folks wondering about Howard Dean after the Jodi Wilgoren article about Dean's wife ran?
