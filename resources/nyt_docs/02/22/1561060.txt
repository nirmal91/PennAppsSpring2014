To the Sports Editor:
So Bud Selig says, ''I want to make it abundantly clear to all clubs that I will not allow cash transfers of this magnitude to become the norm.'' (''Yanks Assure Jeter He's Safe at Shortstop,'' Feb. 17.)
This sounds suspiciously like the seven last chances certain players have been afforded in matters involving drug abuse and the tortured official nonresponses to the steroids phenomenon. Hint to Selig: Pete Rose is not the only one with a credibility problem in Major League Baseball.
