Suffolk Republicans have decided not to challenge Elie Mystal in the March 9 special election to fill the unexpired term of Maxine S. Postal, the Suffolk legislator who died Jan. 1 from a rare brain disorder. Mr. Mystal was Ms. Postal's companion and had served as her chief of staff since she was first elected in 1987.
''He's been her alter ego and shadowed her throughout her tenure,'' said Richard Schaffer, the chairman of the Suffolk Democratic Committee. ''If we couldn't have her, the next best thing is Elie. He knows the issues. Elie represents a continuation of what residents said they were happy with.''
Ms. Postal was re-elected last November with 89 percent of the vote in the 15th District, which includes Amityville, Copiague, East Farmingdale, North Amityville, North Babylon, West Babylon, Wheatley Heights and Wyandanch.
Four calls to Patricia Acampora, the state assemblywoman who is chairwoman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee, were not returned. A spokeswoman for the county Board of Elections said that no Republican candidate had filed by the deadline last Monday.
The only challenge Mr. Mystal, 58, may face could come from Jordan Wilson, 41, of North Babylon. A vice president of a financial firm, Mr. Wilson filed petitions with 1,339 signatures in the hopes of getting on the ballot as the Community Party's candidate. But the Democratic Party filed challenges to Mr. Wilson's petitions, and a court was scheduled to rule on the challenge last Thursday.
