Re: ''Heaping More Dirt on Plum Island'' [Feb. 15]: ''My agenda is not to close Plum Island, it's to make it safe,'' said Michael Christopher Carroll, author of ''Lab 257,'' diluting his strong warnings.
Why not move it?
What benefit is there from having deadly animal research two miles from such a heavily populated area, when birds and mosquitoes can easily travel that distance and beyond?
Why has nothing been learned from 9/11, anthrax, ricin, West Nile virus, SARS and bird flu? Why ignore the fact that most new human viruses come from animals and become more deadly when they jump species?
Why do we have to wait until after terrorism, accidents or naturally occurring dangers create widespread epidemics from Plum Island? Why is there not an outrage from the public, the media, and politicians? And most of all, why are government officials doing nothing but stubbornly defending their unconvincing assurances of safety?
