Austin's official motto is ''Live Music Capital of the World,'' which is certainly believable for 10 days in mid-March, when the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music, film and interactive-arts festivals attract thousands of visitors, not to mention more than 1,000 bands from as far away as Uzbekistan, to the capital of Texas.
But there's another, unofficial mantra in Austin these days, showing up on T-shirts and bumper stickers: ''Keep Austin Weird.'' A decade or so ago, that was not a problem in a town where on a given day a 10-minute stroll down Congress Avenue might yield sightings of Willie Nelson, a sky-darkening swarm of bats, and a thong-and-boots clad transvestite named Leslie, who once got 8 percent of the vote for mayor.
But for a while during the high-tech boom of the late 1990's, Austin had more incoming U-Haul trailers than any other city in America, bringing young techies hoping to become the next Michael Dell, or at least to work for him. Their tract mansions filled the hills surrounding the laid-back college town, music saloons were torn down for office buildings and lofts, and exotic martinis were ordered in places that used to serve only cold beer and shots.
Happily, though, even newcomers appear to embrace Austin's friendly weirdness. It's a young town, with more than 55,000 students at the University of Texas, which makes for an active night life. To help light the way, look for the 17 remaining ''moon towers,'' 165-foot lampposts from 1894. And on sunny days, when springtime temperatures can hit 80 and bluebonnets speckle the ground, it is an outdoor town, with hills for biking (Lance Armstrong trains here), hiking trails and waterways for kayaking or lazing on the banks.
Events
In keeping with the ''Keep Austin Weird'' theme, Little Richard will be the keynote speaker and performer at the South by Southwest music festival, an industry event for up-and-coming musicians and the record labels looking to sign them that starts March 17 and runs on 50 stages through March 21. Lovers of Texas and Texican music can look forward to performances by the Flatlanders and Los Lonely Boys. Badges for all performances, seminars and workshops are expensive ($525 to $775); for those who aspire only to be in the audience, a limited number of wristbands, which waive cover charges but don't guarantee admissions to crowded shows, are $105, with the price rising to $125 in mid-March. Those who are really determined can buy tickets to some individual performances ($10 to $35, but get in line very early). Free outdoor concerts by acts including the reggae group Toots and the Maytals will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. on March 18, 19 and 20 at Auditorium Shores, downtown on Town Lake. Information: www.sxsw.com; (512) 467-7979)
Perhaps inspired by the widely publicized battles in the state legislature over redistricting last year, the SXSW Film Festival will focus on political documentaries starting March 12. Among them is ''Bush's Brain,'' a profile of Karl Rove, the president's adviser and electoral strategist. SXSW Film badges cost $250.
Austin's cowboy heritage will be celebrated March 13 to 27 at the Star of Texas Fair and Rodeo, with professional rodeo events and a music concert each night. Performers this year include Merle Haggard and Wynonna Judd. Tickets are $16 to $30. Most events are at the Travis County Exposition Center; (512) 919-3000 or www.rodeoaustin.com.
Zilker Park, 2100 Barton Springs Road, (512) 477-8672, online at www.ci.austin.tx.us/zilker, a 360-acre oasis just west of downtown, is a place where workers can sneak off for a lunch-time walk, Frisbee golf or some serious kite flying. On March 27 and 28, the Zilker Garden Festival will be held at the Zilker Botanical Garden, 2220 Barton Springs Road, with music, games, flower-related arts and crafts and gardening exhibitions. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $5.
On March 28 Austin will go wild in the streets as some 16,000 runners, ranging from the world's top athletes to goofballs in armadillo costumes, will lace up for the Austin American-Statesman Capitol 10-kilometer charity road race. It takes place on the Hike and Bike Trail bordering Town Lake, the dammed portion of the Colorado River that crosses downtown. Too many margaritas the night before? There's an untimed walk, too. The registration fee is $22 for the timed race, and $20 for the fun run and stroll. Call (512) 445-3598 for details.
The Saveur Texas Hill Country Wine and Food Festival, April 1 to 4, combines tastings and fine wine auctions, cooking classes and tours. More than 35 top Texas chefs will take part in events ranging from sit-downs at the Four Seasons Hotel to a bus tour of the best Hill Country barbecue joints. Tickets: $25 to $125. Registration begins Feb. 23 at www.texaswineandfood.org; (512) 542-9463.
Sightseeing
The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, 21st and Guadelupe Streets, (512) 471-8944, www.hrc.utexas.edu, was recently reopened after remodeling; glass panels now illuminate a research library with more than a million rare books and manuscripts and five million photos, and countless works of art. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday, and noon to 5 p.m. weekends. It is closed Monday.
O. Henry, the short-story writer, lived in a small Queen Anne cottage downtown from 1893 to 1895, where he published a newspaper called The Rolling Stone. His restored house, with artifacts and memorabilia, is now the O. Henry Museum, 409 East Fifth, (512) 472-1903, www.ci.austin.tx.us/parks/ohenry.htm. It is open noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday; admission is free.
At the Broken Spoke, 3201 South Lamar Boulevard, (512) 442-6189, www.brokenspokeaustintx.com, a classic Texas roadhouse dance hall, Austinites in tight jeans, Stetsons and exotic boots scoot around the well-worn wooden floor to live music. Yankees are welcome as long as they behave. Open 10:30 a.m. to midnight Tuesday to Thursday, until 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
Considered the emerald green soul of Austin, Barton Springs Pool in Zilker Park, 2201 Barton Springs Boulevard, (512) 476-9044, is a natural swimming hole over 900 feet long. Gates open at 5 a.m.; from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. admission is $3. Closed Thursday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. for cleaning.
A grocery store on the sightseeing list? The two Central Markets (www.centralmarket.com), at 4001 North Lamar, (512) 206-1000, and 4477 South Lamar, (512) 899-4300, are no ordinary supermarkets. Food lovers admire the variety and freshness of produce, the wine and cheese selections, the cooking classes, the on-site cafe (often with live music, of course). Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; the cafe is open 7 a.m to 10 p.m.
Where to Stay
Built in 1936 as a motor court, the bungalow-style Hotel San José, 1316 South Congress, (512) 444-7322, fax (512) 444-7362, www.sanjosehotel.com, is now a gathering point for South Congress hipsters attracted to the quasi-monastic vibe: zen gardens, concrete floors, sparse furnishings and a tiny courtyard pool. The fastest things about the place are broadband Internet access, the action at the bar and the speed with which regulars make return reservations. Rooms start at $75 with shared bath ($135 with private bath).
Near the University of Texas campus is an elegant bed and breakfast, the 48-room Mansion at Judges' Hill, 1900 Rio Grande, (512) 495-1800, www.mansionatjudgeshill.com. The original 1900 mansion has 10 luxuriously appointed rooms; each blends Texan antiques, rich fabrics and high-speed Internet. Rooms in the modern north wing, more of a boutique hotel, are no less opulent. Mansion rooms are $159 to $295, north wing rooms are $129 to $169, all come with Continental breakfast weekdays. The restaurant is one of Austin's finest.
Budget: As the motto says at the Austin Motel, 1220 South Congress, (512) 441-1157, ''So Close and Yet So Far Out.'' Although within walking distance to downtown, shopping, the bars and the bats, even the limousine crowd shows up to hang at the pool. The 41 homey, eclectically decorated rooms start at $60 weekdays, ($106 for a luxury double weekends). Thanks to the funky neon sign, you'll never confuse it with the Hilton.
Luxury: In 1886, Col. Jesse Driskill, a cattle rancher, built the Driskill Hotel, 504 Brazos, (512) 474-5911, fax (512) 474-2214 www.driskillhotel.com, a neo-Romanesque mansion. Completely refurbished in 1999, the hotel has cowhide sofas in the lounge under high, pressed-tin ceilings. Many of the 186 rooms are quite small, but all decorated tastefully with Romanesque-inspired furnishings. Rates from $210.
With four championship courses, the Barton Creek Resort and Spa, 8212 Barton Club Drive, (512) 329-4000, fax (512) 329-4597, a 20-minute drive from downtown, is a golfer's paradise. The 300 rooms and suites ($290 to $1,350) combine Southwestern elegance with functionality, including high-speed Internet.
Where to Eat
Jeffrey's Bar, 1204 West Lynn, (512) 477-5584, is considered by many to be the place for special occasions, like signing a record contract or, say, getting elected (President Bush asked the owners to open a branch near the White House when he left Austin in 2001). But any night can be special with a light (and less expensive) meal at the bar, which takes up one of the three rooms. A glass of wine goes well with the crispy oysters on yucca root chips with habanero honey aioli. For dessert, try the key lime crème brûlée with Grand Marnier blueberries. If you're really hungry, the beef tenderloin is substantial. A typical meal for two with wine would cost about $150. Dinner nightly.
For some, breakfast is the perfect nightcap. The all-night (and all-day) Magnolia Cafe, 1920 South Congress, (512) 447-7636, attracts the bejeweled and the besotted alike. There may be a movie star or a diva at the next booth. Try on a pair of Three-Alarm Tacos (eggs, potato, cheese and jalapeños in a flour tortilla), for $5.75, or a full stack of gingerbread pancakes ($4.25). Quesadillas come in many variations for $3.95 to $6.50.
The place for young Austin (and that includes kids) to see and be seen is Guero's Taco Bar, 1412 South Congress, (512) 447-7688, a great introduction to chips-and-salsa Austin Tex-Mex restaurant culture. President Clinton favored this combo plate and had it named after him: A chicken breast taco, a tamale, a beef taco, and guacamole, with corn tortillas ($9.95). A meal for two with drinks runs around $35. Lunch and dinner weekdays; breakfast, lunch and dinner weekends. Right across the street is the Continental Club, one of Austin's most venerable music venues.
If your religion is barbecue, keep the faith at the Sunday Gospel Brunch at Stubb's, 801 Red River, (512) 480-8341, fax (512) 480-8345. Gospel groups will get you on your feet, if only to make it to the Southern breakfast buffet or for another helping of Texas black angus beef brisket with Serrano spinach, collard greens, whipped yams or buttermilk pie. The brunch (reservations essential) is $14.95 a person. Lunch and dinner Tuesday to Sunday.
