David Markson is often labeled the avant-garde writer's avant-garde writer, the cult favorite of a tiny cult. David Foster Wallace called Markson's novel ''Wittgenstein's Mistress'' (1988) ''pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country'' -- for some readers, probably less high praise than a warning. But while even fans of Markson's witty, moving un-novels might admit that they're not for everyone, perhaps they should be. It helps to love poetry. Like Markson's other books, VANISHING POINT (Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, paper, $15) strings together a series of atomic factoids about artists. ''Giacomo Puccini's fanatic addiction to duck hunting,'' reads one fragment. ''Nathaniel Hawthorne never learned which side won the Civil War,'' says another. At first, these tidbits seems random. But uneasy themes begin to build, among them the slicing intensity with which one artist critiques another (''A latrine, Baudelaire called George Sand.'') It emerges that these notes are research, the notecards of a elderly narrator called simply ''Author.'' And the facts he has compiled suggest a set of terrifying anxieties, all related to the possibility of creating lasting art. Our shadowy narrator seems to be struggling against time, and against his own material -- trying to erase his authorial presence, but leaving, despite (or because of) his best efforts, a trail of anxious footnotes in the sand. It's a structural trick that's both evocative and gimmicky. And by its conclusion, ''Vanishing Act'' emerges as an effectively eerie act of ''seminonfictional semifiction'' -- less storytelling than meditation, a musical rumination on the fear that underlies all creation.
