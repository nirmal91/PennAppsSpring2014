You defend the characterization of a 55-40 split in public opinion as ''strong support'' for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and assert that such a split ''would constitute a landslide in any election this side of Beijing.'' Well, it certainly would not constitute a landslide for a constitutional amendment. Because a constitutional amendment requires approval by two-thirds of each house of Congress and three-fourths of the states, a 55-40 split would constitute easy defeat in any of those venues.
