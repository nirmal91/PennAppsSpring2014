As a reader, I prefer to read quotes like the one reportedly uttered by a Howard Dean spokeswoman about John Kerry (''What you're seeing is a career politician desperate to save his political career''). Your lifeless substitution -- ''A Dean spokeswoman dismissed Senator Kerry's charge as political'' -- offers no match for the original's energy and color.
Quotes open up the prose. They give it flesh and heat. Words are literally carried on breath. There's a pulse there. Would you also eliminate photographs from newspaper articles?
