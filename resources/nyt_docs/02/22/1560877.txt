THE sell-off of the Nasdaq composite proved unstoppable last week, as this technology-heavy index fell for the fifth consecutive week. The Dow Jones industrials and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped slightly, after rising the previous two weeks.
Since Jan. 26, when the Nasdaq reached its highest close in more than two and a half years, the index has fallen 5.4 percent and is up only 1.7 percent for the year. That is less than the 2.9 percent rise in the S.&amp;P. 500 and just ahead of the 1.6 percent gain in the Dow.
Comcast, which made an unsolicited bid for Walt Disney on Feb. 11, was among the big decliners in the Nasdaq, down 16.4 percent since Jan. 26 and 11.2 percent since the takeover bid. Amazon.com is down 21 percent and Cisco Systems is off 15.7 percent since Jan. 26.
For the week, the Nasdaq fell 15.63 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,037.93. The Dow slipped 8.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,619.03, while the S.&amp;P. 500 lost 1.7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,144.11.
In the bond market, an increase of 0.5 percent in the Consumer Price Index for January sent the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note up to 4.09 percent on Friday, compared with 4.04 percent the week before.
