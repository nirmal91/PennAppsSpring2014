Re ''Remember Dancing? They Do'' [Feb. 8]: While it was fun to see some of our friends on the front page of the paper, the article seemed to imply that ballroom dancers on Long Island are all seniors on the prowl. Quite the contrary -- we are there for dancing, not romancing. There are many happy couples who have met on the dance floor, but that is true of any activity that brings people together who have a mutual interest.
The fact is that the great majority of people who attend these dances are married couples who continue to pursue a lifelong interest in ballroom dancing.
