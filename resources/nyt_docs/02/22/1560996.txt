To the Editor:
Re ''Political Timing, Outsourced'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
You say shifting call center jobs and other presumably higher-end professions of the information age to, say, India, is ''freeing up American capital, labor and other resources for more efficient, high-value uses.''
So an American company saves X dollars on its labor costs and uses those savings -- for what? New investments overseas? Higher benefits for its executives? Greater profits for its stockholders?
So an American worker laid off to produce those savings uses his newly bestowed free time -- for what? Getting a Ph.D. in molecular biology? Becoming one of those high-paid, ever-lower-taxed executives himself? Working at Wal-Mart for minimum pay and minimum benefits?
The new economic pyramid: all top and no bottom.
