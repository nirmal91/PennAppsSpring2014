State Assemblyman Robert Sweeney, a Democrat from Lindenhurst, has filed a bill to stop wireless companies from improperly collecting a 30-cent monthly surcharge.
Mr. Sweeney said the State Legislature had authorized New York City, Nassau and 25 other counties to collect the surcharge on wireless bills. But a problem arose, he said, when a customer moved from one of those jurisdictions to a county, like Suffolk, that did not collect the surcharge.
Mr. Sweeney, the chairman of the Assembly's Local Government Committee, said that in such cases it appeared that wireless companies frequently continued to collect the 30 cents each month, even when customers advised providers that they had moved to a county where no surcharge was due.
He said a woman who moved from Nassau to Suffolk and challenged the continuing surcharge brought the practice to his office's attention. ''When she attempted to correct the matter, she was given the runaround and the surcharge remained,'' Mr. Sweeney said. The company, which he did not name, relented after he intervened and refunded the improperly collected amount, he said.
Wireless customers are asked to list their place of primary use when they sign service contracts. The companies use the information to determine whether the surcharge should apply. But according to Mr. Sweeney, the companies appeared to make little effort to update their records when customers moved. ''If they were paying the surcharge before, they end up continuing to pay it,'' he said. The bill would require companies to refund surcharges they shouldn't have collected.
''People should take care to read through their bills and if they have questions about the charges, they should ask someone about it,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''It is entirely possible they are paying for something they shouldn't be paying for.''
