To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof (''Vrooming Into Yellowstone,'' column, Feb. 18) is right to urge that public requests that would promote use of our national parks be adequately addressed.
Last summer, I might have completed the Death Valley marathon if I had been provided the air-conditioned beltway I requested. Which reminds me: my cousin would like to tour the redwoods in his new Hummer.
I'd also like to propose tanks of hot cocoa be set up in Joshua Tree. Wintertime can be chilly there. While we're at it, broadcasting Sousa marches in all national parks might be inspiring.
One final request: an elevator for my great-uncle Lyle. He's always wanted to ascend Half Dome in Yosemite, but now lacks the requisite skills. (I won't even tell you about my brother. Let's just say he bought a tank on eBay, and he'd love to test-drive that puppy in Alaska.)
