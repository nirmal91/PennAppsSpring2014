To the Editor:
I object to the sarcastic Op-Ed by Larry David (''My War,'' Feb. 15).
I was a member of the National Guard for 10 years in the 1980's. I do not claim to be a hero, since we were never called to active duty. But I knew that I could be called for riots and disasters.
And cushy summer duty? Where did Mr. David serve? Not in a combat unit.
People in combat-related units of the Guard do get hurt and even killed during training. One year, a man was killed by an errant shell. Another died in a tank accident. And pilots (like George W. Bush) have a higher rate of casualties than people in ordinary units.
Maybe the grinch who didn't see Mr. Bush in Alabama is the same grinch who didn't see me doing physicals and first aid in the Massachusetts National Guard. For five weekend drills, I was paid for only one weekend. So excuse me for not getting excited that Mr. Bush can't ''prove'' he drilled in Alabama.
