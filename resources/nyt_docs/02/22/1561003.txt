The four Democratic candidates who dropped out of the race in recent weeks all spent heavily in January's early primaries, but none more so than the upstart candidates Howard Dean and Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
Each man embraced the Internet as a fund-raising tool and brought in millions. They then spent heavily to introduce themselves to voters and to try to win selected primaries. Though both were unsuccessful, it was not for lack of spending.
Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, ran through $10.9 million in January and his campaign spent $42.6 million over all through Jan. 31, campaign finance reports show. General Clark spent even more last month -- $11.8 million -- and his late-blooming bid, which began in September, posted expenditures totaling $22.3 million. ''It takes money to run a campaign,'' said Matt Bennett, a spokesman for the Clark campaign. ''But money plus momentum is what wins.''
Senators John Kerry and John Edwards have also ridden a financial roller coaster through the primaries.
Mr. Kerry, who is from Massachusetts, brought in about $7.7 million in January, including $4.1 million in contributions and additional money from a home mortgage he took out late last year, reports show. He spent $7.1 million and closed out the month with $2.1 million in the bank. The campaign showed total debts of about $7.3 million. So far in February, Mr. Kerry has raised about $5 million, according to the campaign.
Mr. Edwards, who is from North Carolina, raised about $2 million in January and took in $3.4 million in public financing, reports show. He spent about $5.9 million and closed the month with about $500,000 in the bank and $383,000 in debt.
This month, he raised roughly $3.2 million more and is expecting a public financing payment in March of almost $1 million, the campaign said.
Both Democrats are raising far less than President Bush, who brought in $12.8 million in January and $143.6 million over all, reports show. He spent about $7.6 million in January and $41.2 million over all, and closed last month with about $104 million in the bank.
