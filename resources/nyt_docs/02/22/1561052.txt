State child welfare officials presented a sweeping plan -- almost 200 pages long -- last week to overhaul the troubled Division of Youth and Family Services. A key element of the plan, one requirement of an agreement that settled a lawsuit filed against the state's foster care system, is the hiring about 1,000 new caseworkers. The plan, carrying a price tag of about $125 million in the next fiscal year, would also limit to 15 the number of children for whom individual caseworkers are responsible and create teams of forensically trained investigators required to respond more quickly to reports of child abuse. An independent panel overseeing the changes in the system will review the plan and either approve it or ask the state for revisions. If the state cannot make the requested changes, a federal judge may intervene.
