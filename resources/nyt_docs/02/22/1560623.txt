Why yellow?'' I ask, as blonde after blonde parades the runway, trumpeting fashion's latest obsession. Yellow is what happens when white goes bad. It's the tint of jaundice, the brand of the coward and lunacy's color of choice. (Think Van Gogh's crow-crazed fields under seething skies.)
Oh, sure, wrapped around the throat of a tawny blonde, a buttery scarf waving in the breeze can become a flag of sunshine conquering the gloom of winter. But what about the lumpen unblond rest of us? Are we condemned to sit this trend out? Uh, do you have that in black?
Curious about yellow, I call on Giella Poblocki, of Giella Custom Blend Cosmetics, at Henri Bendel. Poblocki says it's not the color per se that must be considered, but the value, depth and intensity. A person with light-colored hair and eyes does better with a paler shade; darker skin tones want deeper, saturated color. So it's soft gold for the fair; primary yellow for olive, brown and black skin.
Everyone who wears yellow should switch to warmer makeup. Pink lips should give way to peach and sienna; gray and plum eye shadows, to mocha. Pulling out squeeze bottles of pigment, Poblocki concocts ways to wear yellow on the face -- a brush of gold powder on top of pink blush; butter-cream liner along blue eyes; sheer lemon powder under the brows for a brown-eyed gal. And for blonde and brunette alike, sheer lip gloss brings it all together, while a bright yellow toenail polish makes it fun.
