To the Editor:
Mr. Rich is certainly on the mark in criticizing the contrived nature of appearances by political candidates on would-be entertainment programs like NBC's ''Tonight Show.''
But Mr. Rich is incorrect in saying that it was the presidential aspirant Bill Clinton who was quizzed about his preference in underwear on MTV. In fact it was Bill Clinton, president, who not only fielded the question in a 1994 appearance on MTV but also chose to share that he usually preferred briefs. Perhaps Mr. Clinton's openness on MTV weakened a wall of dignity that would have served him well during the Starr investigation a few years later.
