To the Editor:
As someone who has been lucky enough never to have seen an episode of ''Friends,'' I read with delight Kate Stone Lombardi's County Lines column, ''Oh, to Live in That Westchester!'' (Feb. 15).
Although I miss the target audience by a few years (unfortunately on the high side), I imagine that it is probably as bad as any of these reality shows (none of which I have ever seen either).
If Monica and Chandler do decide to live in Westchester, I hope it's not in my neighborhood!
You might call me prejudiced, because I have never seen the show but I am willing to bet that they are the kind of people who would talk very loud on their cellphones on Metro-North, and also while they are driving.
They are probably the kind of people who will badger the coaches, referees and other parents of whatever sports their kids play.
They sound like the type of people who get on the ''five items or less -- cash only'' line with 124 items and their credit card.
So, somebody, please tell Chandler and Monica that Plandome is the best town in Westchester and they don't even have to change at Jamaica. And I am sure that they both use ''he and I'' as objects of prepositions.
