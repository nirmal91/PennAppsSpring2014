To the Editor:
Having moved to Manhattan in 1974, I can empathize with Beth Harpaz's mother's dread of the ''urban decay'' into which the city had long fallen by then. But early in 1976 my wife and I moved into 210 West 21st Street, Apartment 4F, with its new wood floors and freshly painted walls, and lived there happily, and quite safely, through most of 1980.
The building was being refurbished apartment by apartment; it was always fully occupied, and gentrification, gay and otherwise, was well under way. While not perhaps yet chic, it was hardly a slum --not by anyone's definition, now or then.
