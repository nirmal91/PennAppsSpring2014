To the Editor:
Re ''Political Timing, Outsourced'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
Both sides in the debate over outsourcing frequently miss the point. Those against it are often resisting the development of safe, comparatively well-paying jobs in developing countries. On the other hand, those who support it have little to say about the damage done to local communities as business operations move offshore.
Since outsourcing and productivity gains have become such a gold mine for American businesses, surely the answer is to start sharing the spoils with the rest of the community.
By increasing taxation on corporate profits, we can transform a worrying trend into a means of funding education, retraining and the creation of better jobs at home. At the same time, strictly enforced labor and environmental standards can help prevent exploitation and unfair competition abroad.
