A new double-decker cable car in France that links the Alpine ski resorts of La Plagne, Peisy-Vallandry and Les Arcs has consolidated these Savoyard mountain stations into a megaresort called Paradiski.
The Vanoise Express cable line, which began service in late December, can ferry 200 people in four minutes over the 1.2-mile valley that separates the major stations. Skiers now have easy access to about 20 villages and 238 ski runs, 2 skiable glaciers and 143 ski lifts. A one-day Paradiski pass is $57 (prices at $1.29 to the euro); a six-day unlimited pass: $282. Information: (33-4) 79.09.79.79 or visit www.paradiski.com.
