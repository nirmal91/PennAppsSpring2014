I differ with your opinion on Jan. 4 about The New York Times/CBS News Poll on gay marriage. In the interest of full disclosure, I was one of the founders of the Times/CBS News Poll back in 1975 when I worked at CBS News, and I managed it for its first 15 years.
There is nothing any more unbalanced about a newspaper reporting its own poll than there is about a newspaper reporting any other news story reported by one of its staff. The Times relies on the reporting ability of its reporters; by the same token, The Times relies on the veracity of its polling practices. The reason The Times and CBS got into the polling business was precisely because they did not want to rely on the unverified work of other polls where they did not contribute to the questions or the methods.
What average readers must rely on is the competence and integrity of The Times, just as they do for all the other news they get from the paper.
