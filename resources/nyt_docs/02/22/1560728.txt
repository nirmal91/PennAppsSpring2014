Virgin Atlantic Airways is offering a new antidote to travel stress: a meditation program on its in-flight audio selections. The program was introduced this month on 9 of Virgin's 29 aircraft, most of which fly between Britain and the United States.
Developed by Meditainment Ltd., a British company that also produces group meditation events, the program is a combination of soothing music and a narrator guiding the listener to a choice of settings. ''There's a desert island, there's the moon, there's a meadow and the Arctic,'' said Lysette Gauna, head of media for Virgin. ''The idea is to quiet the chatter in your brain and transport you somewhere else, to take you away from your environment.''
The addition to Virgin's entertainment lineup taps into the popularity of yoga and meditation, Ms. Gauna said, but is also a reflection of the current travel climate. ''There's a lot of anxiety, even more than ever before, about flying,'' she said.
Virgin also has an audio channel with a psychotherapist who addresses flying fears with relaxation techniques and calming tips, which Ms. Gauna said was popular.
Rob Brookler, a spokesman for the World Airline Entertainment Association, a nonprofit organization focused on in-flight entertainment services, said that calming or relaxing programs have become popular in recent years .
''Given the increasing amount of stress and hurry-up-and-wait kind of experience that travelers are going through just to get onto the aircraft, I would guess that this would be a popular type of programming,'' Mr. Brookler said.
