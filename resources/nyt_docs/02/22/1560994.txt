Despite the harsh winter, the State Department of Transportation said last week that roads were in fairly decent shape heading into the end of February.
''We don't have any big areas of concern right now,'' John J. Wallace, a department spokesman said, referring to potholes. ''We're just out there daily doing patching.''
Mr. Wallace did say, however, that the department is keeping a close watch on construction areas, like the one on the eastbound side of Interstate 84 near Waterbury, where a large pothole caused a traffic problem earlier this month. He said roadwork can produce extra wear and tear that leads to potholes.
The department also said its supplies of sand and salt are holding up. Mr. Wallace said the department has used 75 percent of its yearly average of road salt and 73 percent of its sand, at a combined cost of around $4.9 million.
Railroad commuters also got good news last week. After running on a reduced schedule for a large portion of the winter, partially caused by train cars damaged by snow, Metro-North said it was back to a regular schedule on Tuesday.
