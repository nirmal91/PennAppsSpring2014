To the Sports Editor:
It appears that the baseball fracas over the Yankees' Rodriguez acquisition is just a microcosm of what we are seeing on the world scene. Avoiding the rights and wrongs and the actual issues, the moguls Steinbrenner of the Yanks and Henry of the Red Sox are going back and forth, and one of them is downtrodden and the other the nefarious culprit. It's amusing that Henry chided the Yankees' boss for doing what Henry tried but failed to do a few months ago; Steinbrenner reminded him that the major league owners' committee voted down the preventive measures.
I hope the public is not being lulled into thinking that this is a battle between the greedy and the maligned. Rather this is a standoff between two millionaires who use their franchises as toys with the sports fans picking up the eventual tab in prices for tickets and goodies at the ballpark. Or they insist, and succeed, in having city governments yield to their lustful demands for tax breaks and perks.
I am a dyed-in-the-wool Yankee fan and finding myself in Steinbrenner's camp is the best example of politics making for strange bedfellows.
