THE EPICURE'S LAMENT
By Kate Christensen.
Doubleday, $23.95.
Hugo Whittier loves eating good food, drinking, smoking, reading and seducing women of all ages. But Hugo's also a misanthrope and hermit, his health is poor (he suffers from the obscure Buerger's disease), and although he could save himself if he stopped smoking, at 40 he's preparing to overdose on painkillers. This novel, Kate Christensen's third, is Hugo's diary during the months before he attempts suicide. For the last 10 years, Hugo has lived in seclusion in his ancestors' Hudson River mansion; as the novel unfolds, several visitors -- including Hugo's estranged wife, a 10-year-old daughter who may not be his and his earnest, overly emoting brother -- show up to disturb the peace. ''The Epicure's Lament'' is readable, but it's also clever to a fault and often static. The diary form doesn't serve the book well: Hugo's misanthropy feels more like a literary device than a genuine personality trait. When other characters appear, however, the book comes alive. Christensen writes crackling dialogue, and Hugo's observations about specific individuals are far sharper than those he makes about either himself or humankind: his maybe-daughter is ''a soft potato of a child,'' while a former hit man smells of ''a vaguely froggy-went-a-courtin' kind of aftershave.''
