A report in the Worth Noting column on Page 2 of the Connecticut section today describes the case of a Waterbury man charged with having falsely reported that his wife, an Army Reserve sergeant, had died in Baghdad. It said the reservist, Betsy Valentin, had since applied for leave to come home. On Thursday evening, after the section had gone to press, Sergeant Valentin arrived in Connecticut.
