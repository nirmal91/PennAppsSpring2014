To the Sports Editor:
The On Baseball column by Murray Chass (''Summer or Winter, the Yankees Show the Red Sox How to Win,'' Feb. 16) on the Alex Rodriguez trade might as well have been written by the Yankees' publicity office, or perhaps by George Steinbrenner. The contemptuous tone seems emblematic of why so many people -- not only in New England -- hate the Yankees and think that Steinbrenner's willingness to outspend every other major league team to acquire players has made a joke of competitive balance in the sport.
The Red Sox are certainly not poor. But not even they can compete with the Yankees' payroll. And what Chass barely touches on is how much more difficult it was for the Red Sox to try to work out a deal for Rodriguez by trading him for Manny Ramirez, who makes $20 million a year. As a consequence, the Rangers offered virtually nothing to the Red Sox to offset Rodriguez's salary. By contrast, Alfonso Soriano makes $5 million a year, and it made getting the Rangers to pay part of Rodriguez's salary for the Yankees that much easier.
And the Yankees clearly benefited because relations between Rodriguez and the Rangers had soured even more in the aftermath of the aborted trade with the Red Sox. Rodriguez was desperate to get out; the Rangers were desperate to get rid of him and out from under his contract.
Lo and behold, Aaron Boone messes up his knee playing basketball, and the Yankees get a new third baseman. That sounds to me more like good luck, rather than ineptitude on the part of the Red Sox, which is how Chass presents it.
