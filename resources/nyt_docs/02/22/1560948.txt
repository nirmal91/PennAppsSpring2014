To the Editor:
I read, with interest, the article ''Tie-Ups in Ardsley Roil Drivers'' (Feb. 8) about the excessive traffic tie-ups impacting the village.
One step that the Town of Greenburgh recently took to address traffic concerns in Ardsley was to enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the village providing the village with the opportunity to appoint one nonvoting representative to serve on our Planning Board when the town considers proposals in unincorporated Greenburgh that will impact the quality of life for Ardsley residents.
We want to be more sensitive to the legitimate traffic concerns that Village of Ardsley residents have before granting developers land use approvals.
We recognize that land use decisions made by our town have environmental and traffic impacts on neighboring jurisdictions.
It's important that our neighbors be given a greater voice in our decision-making process. We get the taxes. They shouldn't be burdened with additional traffic, especially if it has a negative impact on their quality of life.
The Ardsley/Greenburgh Intermunicipal Agreement that provides for representation on each other's Planning Board could help end border wars that take place between neighboring communities every time there is a major development under consideration.
