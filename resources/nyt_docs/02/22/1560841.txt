To the Editor:
Your Feb. 15 editorial ''How America Doesn't Vote'' correctly points out that states throughout the country denied hundreds of thousands of Americans their right to vote in the 2000 election by aggressively purging voter rolls.
This turned on its head the notion that our democracy exists to serve its citizens and to encourage their involvement in the political process. It also explains the continuing decline in voter turnout in the United States.
Current rules that impose substantial burdens on citizens to prove their eligibility to vote have it backward. It should be government's responsibility to ensure that those eligible can vote.
We need new laws like one I am sponsoring in New York that would automatically register people to vote upon reaching the age of 18. This would increase voter turnout and guarantee that government works for the people.
