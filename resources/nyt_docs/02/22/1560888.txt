Kevin Hennessey has a message for executives who complain that they spend too much time cutting through red tape in their jobs: ''Try spending a day in my shoes.''
Mr. Hennessey, a former senior investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston who spent many of his 22 years at the company traveling to Russia, is co-publisher and co-editor of a new, 1,200-page book, ''Russia: All 89 Regions Trade and Investment Guide,'' published in conjunction with the Council for Trade and Economic Cooperation U.S.-Russia. The guide, which sells for $395, offers detailed information for Russia's 89 regions.
Putting together the book, which was celebrated at a party on Thursday night at the World Bank in Washington, was a major logistical undertaking, Mr. Hennessey said. Council members made more than 7,000 telephone calls over more than a year seeking information, then commissioned an army of independent experts to verify the findings.
''Some areas didn't even have fax machines or computers,'' Mr. Hennessey said, ''and the information arrived so slowly that we speculated it must have come via donkey.''
