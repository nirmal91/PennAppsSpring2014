You pooh-poohed those who faulted The Times's coverage of Howard Dean (Jan. 18), attributing their criticisms to pro-Dean sentiment. I am not a Dean supporter, and I believe you minimized legitimate complaints.
The problem is the way that the media cover political races. Front-runners need to be torn down, whether by stories fair or unfair. Reporters set the expectations, then report whether they have been met. Journalists assert their own opinions thinly disguised as ''facts'' (for example, by quoting ''many people,'' without attribution).
The endlessly reported ''Dean scream'' story lays to rest any notion that Dean received fair treatment from the media -- The Times included.
