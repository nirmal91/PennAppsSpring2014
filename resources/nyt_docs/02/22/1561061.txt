To the Sports Editor:
Kudos to the Yanks for getting Alex Rodriguez. But let's face this sooner than later: move him to short. I respect Derek Jeter and appreciate all he has done, but everybody knows that A-Rod is a much better shortstop and that he should be there now. Brian Cashman says something about staying with the one who took us to the dance, but this is not a high school dance. A team, and especially the Yanks, cannot run on sentiment or nostalgia. They need to field the best team possible, and even those of us who respect Jeter as a player and leader cannot say that he makes the team better by being at short when A-Rod is available.
