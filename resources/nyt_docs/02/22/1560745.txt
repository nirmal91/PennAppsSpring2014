In his proposed budget, Governor Pataki seeks to liberalize commerce by allowing out-of-state wineries to ship directly to New York residents. His proviso is reciprocity: Direct shipments would be allowed only from states that accepted direct shipments from New York wineries, a potential boon for the East End.
If Mr. Pataki's measure passes, it would eclipse a decision this month by a federal appeals court in Manhattan that upheld the state's ban on direct shipments of out-of-state wines to consumers, an issue apparently headed for the United States Supreme Court.
By promoting mail-order or online shopping, the governor's goal is to make it easier for out-of-staters to buy New York wines.
Prospective out-of-state customers can now phone a winery whose style they like -- say, Corey Creek -- and ask about national distribution. Corey Creek would respond: District of Columbia, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington State. There is an easier way to get information: the Web site of the Long Island Wine Council, the producers' association (www .liwines.com). Under the heading Vineyards and Wineries, a link points toward producers' ''sales contacts.''
There are many ''self-distributed'' entries, but some wineries offer information. Raphael, for example, sells in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Florida.
When small wineries turn over distribution to distributors with big portfolios, they often ''get lost in the shuffle,'' said Charles Massoud, an owner of Paumanok, in Aquebogue. One result, he said, is that many wineries ''have changed distributors the way they change socks.'' By contrast, ''when you are small, you can pick and choose your customers,'' he said.
''About 55 percent of our sales are at the winery, and much of the rest is divided between New York City and Long Island,'' he said. ''We just sold 100 cases to Japan.''
