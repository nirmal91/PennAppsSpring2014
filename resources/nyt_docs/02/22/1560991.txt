To the Editor:
To answer the United States general who asked Tom Brokaw why Americans have not planted victory gardens (or done something equivalent) to support our troops (Op-Ed, Feb. 19), the answer is that the right person never asked them to.
President Bush could have asked for shared sacrifice to unite the country against a clear and present enemy, Al Qaeda, but preferred to ask only for complacency while he pursued a recklessly executed and less easily justified agenda in Iraq.
