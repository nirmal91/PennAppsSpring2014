George Washington took his oath of office as the first president of the United States on April 30, 1789, while standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street. Presidents' Day is over, but in honor of George's real birthday, which is today, you might want to try some of the restaurants in this historic area.
BAYARD'S  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 514-9454; 1 Hanover Square (near Pearl Street); $$$$; Review: 2/28/01.
Bayard's may be the most distinctive, romantic dining room in Manhattan, although its Federal-style interior and maritime paintings seem more Boston than New York. Chef Eberhard Miller has refashioned the food to suit the surroundings. A restaurant so distinguished-looking demands Dover sole, and it is excellent.
BENNIE'S THAI CAFÉ  (212) 587-8930; 88 Fulton Street (Gold Street); $; $25 and Under: 11/13/02.
At lunch, Bennie's Thai Café serves as a cafeteria for office workers spooning down curries, at dinner as a kitchen table for college students and neighborhood singles eating the excellent pad Thai dishes.
FRAUNCES TAVERN  (212) 968-1776; 54 Pearl Street (Broad Street); $$$; Article: 10/17/01.
The tavern is one of the oldest establishments in New York. George Washington ate there more than once in 1783, to celebrate the evacuation of the British after the Revolution and to bid farewell to his officers. The traditional American menu includes slow-roasted turkey, chicken potpie, pot roast and meatloaf.
LES HALLES DOWNTOWN  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 285-8585; 15 John Street (near Broadway); $$; Review: 2/6/02.
The small white floor tiles and stamped-tin ceiling feel as New York as the Bowery. Classic brasserie dishes come through with flying colors. The hanger steak delivers the goods and so do the fries.
MARKJOSEPH STEAKHOUSE  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 277-0020; 261 Water Street (near Peck Slip); $$$; Review: 7/31/02.
Situated in the South Street Seaport Historic District, MarkJoseph is a classic unbuttoned steakhouse, bustling, casual and masculine. It is a porterhouse specialist, offering huge steaks that serve up to four people each.
2 WEST  (917) 790-2525; Ritz-Carlton Hotel, 2 West Street (near Battery Park); $$$$; Diner's Journal: 4/5/02.
The restaurant 2 West, in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Battery Park City, has barely a toehold on the island of Manhattan. One step back, and it would be bathing in the Hudson. The menu features grilled meats and fresh seafood dishes.
VINE  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 344-8463; 25 Broad Street (enter on Exchange Place); $$$; Review: 6/14/00.
Vine is pleasant, airy and woody, with views of the New York Stock Exchange out the tall front windows. The menu offers new American food with international accents like pan-seared dry scallops with mushrooms, white truffle oil and mushroom syrup.
