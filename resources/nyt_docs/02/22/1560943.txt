To the Editor:
The article ''Bond Referendum Roils Tarrytown District,'' (Feb. 1) quotes a resident as saying, ''It's unfortunate that the school board didn't act years ago, so now we're behind and we're running to catch up.''
Actually, it is unfortunate that the voters didn't approve the proposal to increase the number of classrooms and close the Morse School in the late 1980's, when I was a member of the school board.
Some of the same critics mentioned in the article were loudly opposed to the proposal then.
A main argument against it was that the forecasted large increase in the number of students (about 1,900 then) would not happen. Well, it did; there are about 2,500 students now.
The memory of those times may be what kept the school board from making this proposal until now.
