Joseph V. Doria Jr. may have lost his seat in the State Legislature in the Democratic primary last spring, but he is not prepared to part with his chair. Or his desk. Or any of the comforts of his legislative office at 595 Broadway in Bayonne.
Simply put, Mr. Doria isn't moving from his state office. He has even changed the locks. His successor as assemblyman for the 31st District, Anthony Chiappone, learned the news a week and a half before his inauguration on Jan. 13.
''He had known since June that he had to be out of office,'' said Mr. Chiappone, who said he was baffled by Mr. Doria's intransigence. Mr. Doria remains mayor of Bayonne, and ''he does most off his work out of Bayonne City Hall,'' Mr. Chiappone said, ''so the current office is usually empty.''
Joe Ryan, a spokesman for Mr. Doria, said, ''He has 24 years' worth of stuff, 24 years' worth of files, law books, legislative minutes, a whole variety of things that are being crated up and will be moved out in a couple days. So that's what he needed that time for.''
The Assembly speaker, Albio Sires, granted Mr. Doria until March 1 to pack up, approving a one-month lease extension for the 12-term assemblyman at a cost of $1,200.
On Wednesday, Mr. Chiappone was working up the block at 618 Broadway, where he has set up a makeshift office inside his former photo store. He said he expects his permanent office to be ready on March 1.
Charles Sachs, the landlord at 595 Broadway, said, ''It's kind of childish, to tell you the truth.'' He said Mr. Doria had no right to change the locks without giving him a copy of the key. ''If I really wanted to be childish too, I could just turn off the electricity,'' he added. ''But I'm not going to do that. I don't harbor any grudges. Everybody thinks I'm the big bad landlord. I didn't start it. I didn't lock myself out.''
