There is an interesting paradox in the story of why American Electric Power purchased the property of Cheshire, Ohio (photographs by Mitch Epstein, text by Adam Goodheart, Feb. 8). The problem that bothered residents the most was the result of new pollution-control equipment at our Gavin power plant there. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make Gavin one of the cleanest coal-burning plants in the world. However, equipment we installed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions reacted unexpectedly with other equipment that reduces sulfur dioxide emissions. We know that is no consolation to the residents who were inconvenienced, but it's an important point for those who may think that this is a case of wanton pollution by an uncaring company. On the contrary, the situation resulted from an unforeseen consequence of doing the right thing.
