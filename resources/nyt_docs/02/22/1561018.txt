John Kerry looks Lincolnesque. Or horsy. Or shiny, as if he's had Botox.
While every presidential candidate should expect unflattering political caricatures -- no one, it seems, should expect it more than Mr. Kerry.
No, Kerry came back because he's an homme serioux -- that's French for a man with gravitas -- which is what people want, and it doesn't matter that he has a face like a horse.

Kerry has got the gravitas. He's got that sort of, you know, long-face New England kind of thing, and Edwards has the sun shining in his face, but he can't be elected president.

He won by 39 percent of the vote, which is pretty good. Which begs the question -- so, John, why the long face?

Kerry is great. If he wasn't a basset hound in a previous life, someone has played a cruel trick. Dana Carvey, ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' Feb. 19
Since the Massachusetts senator's Iowa victory last week, operatives for rival Democratic campaigns have been insinuating that Kerry is getting Botox injections, paralyzing the muscles that produce worry lines. Kerry spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter told me she has been busy denying the rumor for the past week.
''Have you looked at him?'' Cutter demanded, referring to her creased, droopy-eyed candidate.
