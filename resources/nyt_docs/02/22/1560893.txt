THERE we were, Mr. Rivello, Mr. Irons and my colleague, $15 and $20 worth of finely packaged Dominican or Honduran tobacco leaf wedged between our fingers, and Ah-nold on the obnoxious flat-screen behind us declaring California's budget emergency for the cameras. An impromptu Camorra, a secret society, of silky smoke and Austrian accents.
We each had our own good reasons for being there, on that day, at that moment.
For Mr. Rivello, it was simply to smoke in peace. Mr. Rivello, as he told us, has nowhere else to go since his wife eighty-sixed his habit. But for me and, I sensed, Mr. Irons, coming to this upstairs redoubt of woolen pinstripes, aged leather and burnished oak was more akin to a pair of 14-year-olds sneaking into an R-rated matinee. The adults back at the office don't know we're here, and we are smoking!
Not that any of us choked, turned queasy or tried to inhale; we were not Greg Brady amateurs. But perhaps we were along for the ride with a buddy who actually knew, for instance, that the boxy wood-and-metal contraption on the table between us was not some Depression-era board game, as I had assumed, but a lighted-cigar holder. The holes in the top of the box, you see, allow falling ash to neatly disappear.
There was another reason for my almost instant affinity for this cigar patch, this grown man's tree house. Where else can you sit down with fully clothed men you've never seen before and instantly strike up the most personal of conversations on a weekday afternoon?
Who wouldn't agree? For a good 30 minutes, we were all brothers in tobacco.
