To the Editor:
In ''A Surge in Autism, but Why?'' (Feb. 8), you say that autism ''includes such behavior as unusual responses to sensory experiences, resistance to change in environment or routine and lack of responsiveness to others.'' Yet neither sensory dysfunction, resistance to change or lack of responsiveness is part of the definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, where autism is listed as a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by behavioral deficits in language, social skills and engagement in repetitive and stereotypical behaviors.
Most of the expensive autism education in New Jersey, unfortunately, is not effective; that is, there are no data to show that it actually teaches children with autism anything. So taxpayers may also end up paying for lifelong custodial care for those same children.
My 5-year-old son has autism. Until recently, his diagnosis would have meant that he had little hope for an independent life. Given advances in behavioral research and treatment, that is no longer necessarily true; but the special education community has been slow to accept these advances. Our children deserve more than the prospect of institutionalization and pharmacological dulling of their problem behaviors. They can learn. We want schools that know how to teach them. Scientific research has shown the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. We need more quality schools and programs. We need more board-certified behavior analysts to work with our children and our families. We need school districts to quit complaining and instead do their job by providing effective educational services, so that we parents don't have to go to court to force them to offer an appropriate education. We need school districts and parents alike to unite in demanding full federal financing of education for the disabled. Our children, and all children, deserve nothing less.
