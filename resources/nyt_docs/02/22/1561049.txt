New Jersey educators may soon have a new curriculum component: Backpack Safety 101. Legislation before the Assembly Education Committee would require teachers to instruct their students on proper techniques for choosing, packing, lifting and wearing a backpack.
''Sometimes you see kids with their backpack on just one shoulder, with a lot of weight on it, or very high or very low, which puts a lot of strain on their lower backs,'' said the sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman Jeff Van Drew, Democrat of Cape May.
The proposal cites data showing that the humble backpack, long a trusted fixture of school life, has a darker side. In 1999, more than 3,400 pupils 5 to 14 years of age sought emergency medical treatment for injuries related to backpacks or book bags. And though chiropractors recommend that backpacks not exceed more than 15 percent of a pupil's body weight, many young pupils bear loads of up to 40 pounds.
If the bill passes, lessons will be performed in accordance with standards set by Backpack Safety America, a corporation that says it educates consumers about the hazards of improper backpack use. Meanwhile, Backpack Safety America suggests using the company's colorful mascot, Pete the Posture Parrot. For rent of $150 a day and a one-time cleaning charge of $100, anyone can borrow the plush costume.
Is Mr. Van Drew familiar with Pete? ''No, I'm not.'' he said. ''I'm absolutely not.''
