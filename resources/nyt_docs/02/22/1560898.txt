To the Editor:
Re: ''The Prisoner of West 21st Street'' (Feb. 15): I was stunned by Beth Harpaz's account of her mother's life in Chelsea during the 60's, 70's and early 80's. My own love affair with New York began in 1975 at a pizza parlor (now a Radio Shack) at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street. Coming to New York straight from college in Vermont, I was bowled over by the stimulation the city offered, but it was especially Chelsea, funky and outlandish, that seemed to be the city's center.
I couldn't believe how lucky I was to land a rent-stabilized studio facing the Chelsea Hotel; for over 25 years that view reminded me of the wonderful literary history that had taken place right outside my window. And of course there were the clubs, the artists and the Empire Diner.
I was always happy to return to my one-room home after a visit outside the city. I even begrudged having to travel south of 14th Street or north of 23rd. Why bother, I wondered, when everything I could possibly want was in Chelsea? (I'll admit, I have since moved to Battery Park City, but that's another love story.)
I just didn't see the muggers lurking in every shadow or the soot stalking the laundry on the clotheslines that Ms. Harpaz writes about. I didn't have a garden, but I did have tomato and strawberry plants on my fire escape. Ms. Farrell's dreams of becoming a model may have been shattered, but isn't a broken heart in New York better than one never touched by magic anywhere else?
