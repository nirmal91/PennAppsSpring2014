To the Editor:
Franklin Foer's fascinating article ''Baptism by Celluloid'' [Feb. 8] includes several quotations from Paul Eshleman of the Campus Crusade for Christ. The last paragraph illustrates a fundamental reality of religion that Mr. Eshleman probably did not intend. Asked about Mr. Gibson's film, with its vastly larger budget and its celebrity gloss, Mr. Eshleman dismissed it with a classic criticism of Hollywood films: ''There's a lot of violence in 'The Passion.'  ''You can't show it to kids.''
Religions cannot escape the truth that no claims of conversions or souls saved will excuse the vast amount of blood shed in the name of gods. Mr. Eshleman's fear of violence in films seems specious compared with the ugly competition between religions that culminates in the real deaths of real people.
