To the Sports Editor:
The Yankees have made out-of-control greed the main focus of baseball today. It is all about money. New York is where American capitalist greed got its start and where it continues to be fostered and promoted. New York has the most money to offer baseball players, and to you New Yorkers this is good. ''Greed is good,'' that guy Gordon Gekko said, and he said it in the movie ''Wall Street,'' which takes place in New York. Baseball is not worth watching because it is a game of millionaires who regularly sell their souls and their bodies to the highest bidder.
