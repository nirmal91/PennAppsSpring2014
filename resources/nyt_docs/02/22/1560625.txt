RING LEADER: As Solange Azagury-Partridge speaks, she glitters, from her jewel-encrusted hands to her shiny dark eyes. At 42, she has reason to be radiant: she runs her own jewelry business in London and is the creative director of Boucheron, where sales are up by a sparkling 86 percent. She was also nominated as Designer of the Year at the Design Museum in London. (The Apple maestro Jonathan Ive walked off with the prize.) It is all the more surprising that she has had no formal training. Her break came in 1987, when she designed her own engagement ring, which became the talk of smart West London (Kate Moss and Madonna requested commissions), and in 1995 she opened her store. Her designs are remarkable for their slinky moving parts and lushness. (The white gold ring, left, has 28 diamonds. Price on request. At Boucheron.) ''Everything was so minimal in the previous decade, jewelry was very controlled,'' she says. ''But I'm a maximalist through and through.''
