The Ghan, a tourist train running from the South coast to the center of Australia, extended its service to the northern port city of Darwin this month, more than doubling the journey, to 1,851 miles in two days.
The weekly trips traverse Australia's mostly empty, sunbaked Outback, linking the elegant southern city of Adelaide with the laid-back capital of the tropical Top End in the Northern Territory. Visitors can board the train at any stop, and break up their trip with a stay in Alice Springs, a base for major attractions like Uluru (Ayers Rock) and King's Canyon, at no extra cost.
As on previous Ghan trips, onboard accommodations are at two levels: the premium Gold Kangaroo service, with all meals and either twin-sleeper cabins with showers or single cabins with in-room sinks and toilets but shared showers; or the Red Kangaroo service, with shared sleeper cabins, or reclining daynighter seats.
Along the way, Gold Kangaroo guests will get a tour of the Alice Springs Desert Park, which spotlights Australia's arid ecosystems. Optional boat or helicopter cruises of Katherine Gorge will be offered to all passengers at Katherine, midway between Alice Springs and Darwin (boat tours cost $40; helicopter-tour costs vary).
Fares, at $1.29 Australian to the U.S. dollar, for the cross-continental journey are $1,399 in Gold Kangaroo class, $1,117 in Red Kangaroo class sleeper cabins, and $353 for daynighter seat tickets.
