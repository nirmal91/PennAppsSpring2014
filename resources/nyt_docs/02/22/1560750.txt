To the Editor:
Frank Rich is right about the phoniness of candidates on late-night television shows [''Paar to Leno, J.F.K. to J.F.K.,'' Feb. 8], but there was one authentic moment in 1960 that may have influenced the outcome of a tight election.
I was editor of Redbook magazine, for which Eleanor Roosevelt had written an article, ''My Advice to the Next First Lady.'' To my astonishment, she agreed to appear on the ''Tonight Show.'' When I asked her why, Mrs. Roosevelt, who had been cool to John F. Kennedy after supporting Adlai Stevenson for the nomination, replied, ''I want to help Senator Kennedy.''
That she did. With Paar sitting next to her in awe, she compared Kennedy's growing rapport with campaign crowds to her husband's experience in 1932 and endorsed him with a simple sincerity seldom seen before or since on late-night TV.
