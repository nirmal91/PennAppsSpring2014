To the Editor:
In the column, Fred Brock explained that ''if you make $100,000 a year in New York, you can duplicate your lifestyle in Kentucky for a bit over $40,000.'' That's true, unless your lifestyle happens to include dining at an ever-changing array of restaurants, shopping at upscale boutiques, going to museums and galleries and generally soaking up the energy of the street.
Though I don't believe I lead the same life here in low-cost Burlington, Vt., that would be available to me at greater expense in New York City, I'm very satisfied. No salary increase could replace the relative lack of traffic, crowds and crime and the views of lake and mountains that we enjoy here.
