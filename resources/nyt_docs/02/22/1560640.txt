To the Editor:
By now, Laura Miller will have received scads of mail concerning Sherlock Holmes's sex life (''The Swinging Detective,'' Jan. 25). ''If Holmes were to become romantically involved, the results would be catastrophic,'' she writes. She should have given a passing nod to Irene Adler, who was encountered in ''A Scandal in Bohemia'' and who, for Holmes, was always ''the woman.'' Clearly Holmes was a romantic. Having met the perfect woman in doomed circumstances, he could never settle for anyone less.
But women certainly did play a part in shaping the relationship between Holmes and Watson. From Miller's account, it doesn't appear that Graham Robb (in ''Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century'') registers the impact of the rise of the suffragist movement on Conan Doyle's tales. The bond between Holmes and Watson was a display of male solidarity in a world threatened not so much by crime as by women demanding the right to vote. And Watson, at least, is proof that the solidarity ended at the bedroom door.
