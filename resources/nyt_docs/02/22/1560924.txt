''We've been euchred!'' The reference is to the card game in which suits are declared and trumps pursued, but whose real object is to prevent one's opponent from gathering the tricks needed to win. Many baseball fans felt euchred last week as the Yankees took Alex Rodriguez off the table in what some are calling the greatest trade in the game's history.
In one particular, baseball today does resemble 32-card euchre: it's played with a short deck. There is only one A-Rod available. That's why the Yankees' move, while above all a brilliant and cost-effective business decision, seemed to some teams and fans more like a steal than a hit, more like deprivation than addition. As a result, cries for re-establishing ''competitive balance'' are in full throat.
It doesn't have to be this way. In a more perfect world, there would be more A-Rods available (and it wouldn't cost so much to pay one). But we've become a nation that isn't very good at producing world-class athletes anymore. Too many of our baseball diamonds are fallow, victims of the urbanization of our culture, video games and television.
The ultimate solution to the personnel problems in baseball (and a host of other social and public health maladies) is getting our youngsters back on the athletic field. But until we do, we can expect the number of truly great players to remain limited and the laws of supply and demand to reign supreme.
In the meantime, we must reject ideas that would sell baseball short and keep the best players from reaching their full potential. If we are to pursue excellence in baseball, as in all other endeavors in our society, we cannot exempt it from the rules of fair play and free enterprise.
The search for competitive advantage should drive all participants toward excellence. If it does not, then something is amiss with baseball as an institution. If this trade is really as big as everyone believes, it should serve as a wake-up call, resulting in positive developments across the entire sport. If the lessons of A-Rod are taken on board, we should expect several things.
*Enhanced economic value. Every team the Yankees play now has the opportunity to fill its stadium by fielding its best lineup and giving its fans an opportunity to see their team competing against the sport's best player and most prestigious team. Teams should be managing, marketing and promoting accordingly.
*More investment in players. The Yankee roster reflects the team's willingness to funnel profits back to the team, retaining stars and attracting the best new players. Revenue sharing was intended to encourage this behavior. More owners must adopt this basic commitment to reinvestment if they want to stay competitive.
*Better cooperation between the players association and the owners. The A-Rod deal proves that the union and the teams can work together to achieve difficult trades that serve the pursuit of excellence. If that spirit of cooperation continues, owners, players and fans will all benefit.
*Different models for success. Talent isn't everything. As the Marlins proved last year, low-payroll teams can be successful at the pinnacle of the game. Achieving competitive advantage involves a lot more than canny trades. Scouting, recruiting, managing, coaching, teamwork and spirit can all have their effect. There is plenty of room in the game for every approach.
The Yankees are rightfully proud of the A-Rod acquisition. They saw an opportunity and acted to seize it. But it's important to remember that A-Rod has yet to swing a bat or field a ball on the Yankees' behalf. He joins a team that faces stiff competition from well-staffed, tradition-rich teams that will be gunning for them.
For now, deep in the chill of February, we can only marvel at the power of the game and a singular player to incite such widespread anticipation, speculation and controversy. How can that be bad for baseball?
