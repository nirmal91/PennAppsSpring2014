To the Editor:
Re ''How the Home Front Can Help,'' by Tom Brokaw (Op-Ed, Feb. 19): I agree with the American doctor in Afghanistan who thought that sending fully armed soldiers to meetings to teach Afghan villagers about health was ''inappropriate.'' But I disagree with Mr. Brokaw's impersonal high-tech suggestion for American involvement.
As one of the civilians helping contribute to ''nation building'' in Afghanistan, I am struck by the need for learning by human-to-human contact. For a country where people have not had a consistent educational system for almost two decades, televisions and computers are just not enough.
Let us show some of the spirit of the victory gardens and muster the courage to teach skills and give support in the old-fashioned way -- by spending time among a people we promised to liberate and empower.
