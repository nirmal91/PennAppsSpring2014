A February without steaming, hearty choucroute garni is a February wasted. To wash down the sauerkraut-laden meats and potatoes, a bracing, trusty blue-chip riesling from Trimbach, the venerable Alsace house, is a must-have. Hubert Trimbach's simple, lemony, lingering 2001 is a brasserie favorite, especially with a starter of oysters. Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street), asks $13.95.
