SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
Rei Kawakubo did not realize that American newspapers, still chivalrous about female breasts, would not be able to print a single picture of her spring Comme des Garçons collection because nipples could be seen through the net tops. The last thing that she was challenging when she sent her models out barefoot in some 30 different skirts was public morals. Each skirt, like this red polyester one ($420, at Commes des Garçons), looked as if it had been cut by hand, as if Kawakubo had taken the muslin and begun to cut circles without thinking where her scissors would land. The results were uncannily thoughtful -- and witty. People think of Kawakubo as humorless perhaps because she rarely smiles, but the unexpected splash of pink accordion pleats at the side of a skirt seemed deeply funny. Look closely enough, and you see a comic-book hoyden with a big mane and a black bustier. Personally, I loathe the mania for vintage because it has made designers lazy. Kawakubo's skirts asserted that designers today don't need more marketing or celebrity but something close to moral courage.
