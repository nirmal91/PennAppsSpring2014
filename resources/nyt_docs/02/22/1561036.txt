You state that unless an entire transcript is provided, ''all quotations are taken out of context.'' But the very nature of a quotation is that it is an excerpt, not a complete transcript. A quotation begins and ends with the least amount of information -- the speaker's own words with or without background -- necessary to accurately and completely convey the substance and significance of what the speaker said. Anything less is misleading at best, and anything more simply is redundant.
