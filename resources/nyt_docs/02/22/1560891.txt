To the Editor:
Retirees aren't the only ones who may want to move to areas with lower costs of living. I bought a five-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath colonial with a garage in Cazenovia, N.Y., outside Syracuse, for $150,000 six months ago. We are in our mid-30's and wanted someplace reasonably affordable with good schools for our daughter.
Compared with the Boston area, where I'm from, my new town offers better schools, less traffic and homes in comparable neighborhoods for two-thirds less money. I'm also exactly 20 miles from the city, the same as when I lived near Boston.
