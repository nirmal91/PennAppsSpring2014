The Salvation Army's in my will, too (Questions for W. Todd Bassett, Deborah Solomon, Feb. 1). I have admired the army all my life. But I have difficulty admiring its plan to devote the $1.5 billion legacy wholly to building motivational community centers. It's what the army does for people that sets it head and shoulders above other faith-based organizations.
I guess I'm not changing my will. But I am wary.
