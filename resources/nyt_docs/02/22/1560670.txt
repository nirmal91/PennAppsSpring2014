Here is a case in which people largely recognized and accepted the price of coal-burning energy, the power company did the right thing and gave them a generous buyout without a protracted legal battle and people moved on with their lives -- or stayed to live them out in the shadows of the power plant, as they chose. The outcome was bittersweet, yes, but seeing people make choices and live with the costs of progress without victimizing and demonizing themselves and one another was refreshing.
