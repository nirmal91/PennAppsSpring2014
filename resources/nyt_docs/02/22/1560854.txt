To the Editor:
Re ''Go Ahead and Cry. It's Happy Hour'' (news article, Feb. 20):
You quote the founder of a Brooklyn group of first-time mothers who gather with their children at a bar once a month to talk and have a drink as saying that she formed the group because she ''missed being able to sit at a bar and have a beer, something you would just not do with a kid in a stroller.'' Now she is able to do just that, courtesy of a little solidarity.
But there are good reasons mothers (and fathers) should think twice about going to a bar with small children in the afternoon (or at any other time). Even putting aside the question of how this portrays alcohol use in a child's eyes, drinking makes the drinker less responsible and more foolhardy -- not something one wants to see in someone who is simultaneously caring for small children.
