The tone of your Feb. 15 column was typically high-handed and arrogant. You are the public ombudsman, yet you certainly have a lot of personal rules and regulations that readers must follow in order for you to take note of their complaints.
Why on earth should we readers have to play by your rules? Don't you work for us? Why don't you take people's complaints at face value instead of deleting them because you don't like being on the end of angry remarks? That's your job, and I shouldn't have to tell you that.
