To the Sports Editor:
Just after Boston's Rodriguez trade blew up, I said that the only real Red Sox hope was cryogenics. After the Yankees' Rodriguez trade, I haven't had the temerity to mention this possibility to any of the Boston crowd, but I still think cryogenics is their best hope.
Now it may be true that John Henry, and Boston, feel so badly about New York's A-Rod trade because it's not good for baseball, but Boston still has the chance to demonstrate what its fans are famous for, namely, eternal patience.
