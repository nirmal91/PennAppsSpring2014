Why are the damages from computer viruses and worms usually expressed in monetary terms? What about lives lost? Computers are used for more than just business and commerce. Health-care professionals and scientists are dependent upon computers to treat patients and to discover mechanisms of disease.
To suggest that these people are ''artists'' or ''pranksters'' or should be protected under the idea of free speech is wrong. Likening these virus writers to arsonists is an apt analogy, but I believe they go beyond arson. A major worm that leads to the loss of scientific grants, scientific manuscripts or patient data could result in increased human suffering and even death. Flight delays caused by these worms could cause a delay in an organ transplant.
If these people are creative geniuses and are doing it purely for the intellectual challenge, they should volunteer at universities helping scientists analyze data. They might be surprised that they would find other smart, creative, sometimes alienated libertarian types there.
