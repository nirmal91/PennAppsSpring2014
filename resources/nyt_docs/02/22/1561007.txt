THE universe being vast beyond mundane comprehension, the fate of a single star in a faraway galaxy should not furrow a brow -- unless one is given to nightmares over black holes.
The monstrous black holes lurking unseen at galactic cores have densely packed masses, the equivalent of millions to billions of stars. So powerful is their gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape them, and anything drawing near will be ripped apart and swallowed up.
This was mostly theory until X-ray telescopes witnessed for the first time the brilliant flare from the death throes of a star, above, that got too close to one of these cosmic gluttons. The observations, reported last week, further confirmed the menacing reputation of black holes.
For those with not enough else to worry about, the discovery raises the question: could this happen to our own star, the Sun? The odds favor our lucky old Sun and nearly all the countless billions of stars. It's somewhat comforting to hear astronomers estimate that a black hole's consumption of a star occurs only once every 10,000 years in a typical galaxy. But our Milky Way galaxy is fairly typical, they say, and what if the 10,000th year is nigh?
Relax. A suspected black hole in this galaxy's center is a relatively puny one, and the Sun and Earth are a safe distance away, at least 25,000 light-years. In fact, in the soothing words of Dr. Alex Filippenko of the University of California, Berkeley, ''No star in our galaxy is in immediate danger of being swallowed.''
So rest assured, if you can, that there's more right here on Earth to lose sleep over than in the heavens -- unless one's mind dwells on invading extraterrestrials or the crash of another asteroid like the one that did in the dinosaurs.
