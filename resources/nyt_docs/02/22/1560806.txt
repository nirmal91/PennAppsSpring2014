Sam Jayne, front man of the Brooklyn-based rock band Love as Laughter and a sometime guy-with-guitar solo performer, never much liked commuting into Manhattan for gigs when he lived in New Jersey.
''I lived in Jersey City for a couple of months in 2002, and I'd go into the city a lot,'' he said recently. ''It would usually be late at night, and the trains would loop around so you'd be forced to go into Hoboken even though you just wanted to get to Jersey City.'' Instead of complaining about the roundabout service or, more sensibly, taking a PATH train, he wrote a song about it.
''Hoboken,'' which has been played to crowds at New York's Irving Plaza as well as indie rock sites around Boston and Washington in recent months, sums up the New Jersey Transit experience this way: ''Hoboken, no jokin!/I don't wanna take the Hoboken line/Hoboken wasting my time/Well I'm suckered into going where I don't want to go, and I never thought a train could move so slow/With such a moan, I'll never leave my home.'' Later verses touch on the sleeping patterns of some passengers and the dreary ambience (''This ain't no scenic route/dark concrete chute'').
Early response to ''Hoboken'' was encouraging enough to prompt Mr. Jayne to record it; he now sells CD's including the song during shows. ''It's so dorky, just a sing-songy kind of thing,'' he said. ''But some people come to shows just to sing along.''
When he plays it, he said, he can usually spot the New Jersey contingent in the crowd. ''It's their favorite. They know all the words. And you definitely see some looks of recognition.''
