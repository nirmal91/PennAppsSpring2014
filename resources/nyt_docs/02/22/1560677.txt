Robert S. Boynton's article (Jan. 25) suggests that ''culture'' is a public ''entitlement'' endangered by copyright extensions. But readers should not confuse the length of copyright enjoyed by corporations with the copyright protection granted to freelancers.
The longer a corporation can extend copyrights, the longer it will thrive and try to keep that work out of the public domain. Here the lawyers may have a point. But freelance creators face a different situation. We speak for many of them.
Most freelancers have no source of income other than their creative work. The accumulated value of that work is no different than the value that accrues to your home and it no more robs the public of its entitlement than does the ordinary ownership of private property.
Within the last two decades the ability of freelance artists and photographers to earn a living has come under assault: from publishers who demand they surrender copyrights in return for assignments, from cutthroat competition with discount ''image providers'' and now from legal ''visionaries'' who wish to make copyright itself obsolete.
