To the Editor:
Having had the same license plates for 26 years and 2 cars, I read ''The Blue Plate, Special'' (Soapbox, Feb. 8) and found it reassuring to know that I am not the only one suffering license plate nostalgia. Mine were yellow, nonreflective 1977-issue plates that said ''NJ,'' with three numbers first, then three letters. These plates were on the first car I ever owned, and in 1987 were transferred to another car, where they stayed for 16 years. Last June I bought a new car (midlife crisis Mini Cooper) and, alas, I decided it was time to start anew. I ordered vanity plates this time. I asked my husband to turn in my old plates, as I myself could not come actually to part with them.
