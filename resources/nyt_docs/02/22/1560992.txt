The Connecticut Sun said last week that it is trying to acquire the first pick in the Women's National Basketball Association draft in April so it can select Diana Taurasi, the star of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team.
The Sun's general manager, Chris Sienko, said he has been working on trading for the first pick since December, when it was awarded to the Phoenix Mercury.
The Sun said it has a lot to offer the Mercury. The Sun has two first-round picks, the fourth and the eighth, two picks in the second round and one more in the third of the three-round draft.
''We've made offers to Phoenix and we've been turned down every single time, and we've put some pretty weighty things on the table,'' Mr. Sienko said. ''The likelihood that we would even have the chance to acquire the pick is probably small. That said, we won't stop. But in the process, we can't lose sight of what we're trying to do with the picks, which is make the team better. There are a lot of other quality players in this draft.''
However, he left no doubt the team would select Ms. Taurasi with the top pick.
''Absolutely,'' Mr. Sienko said. ''We feel she's the best player in the draft.''
The Mercury's vice president and general manger, Seth Sulka, confirmed he has talked with the Sun about the first pick, and did not completely rule out trading it.
''We are going to take calls and look at all our options,'' he said. ''But certainly, we feel that Diana would be an amazing player to add to our team, and it would take a very significant deal for us to pass on that opportunity.''
Coincidentally, the Sun will open its 2004 season at home at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, on May 22, against a Phoenix team that could include Ms. Taurasi.
''She'll probably be playing there that day,'' said Mr. Sienko, laughing. ''Either on our team or someone else's team.''
