To the Editor:
Re ''Political Timing, Outsourced'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
As do most economists, you continue to ignore unforeseen and dramatic changes in the world economy as you unquestioningly support the doctrine of free trade.
You note that ''call center jobs in India'' help India and the United States. But the issue is not low-wage call center jobs. If large numbers of high-paying, high-value-added jobs like radiologists, stock analysts and computer programmers continue to leave America because 100 million well-educated, highly motivated and broadband-connected Indian and Chinese workers will take them at a much lower price over the next decade, what jobs will grow in America?
While the answer to this dilemma is certainly not the old protectionist nostrums, the paradigm change in how the world trades goods demands a new look.
