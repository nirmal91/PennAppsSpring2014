Now that cellphones have become standard accessories, it makes sense that someone would dream up a chic way to wear them. City Loop, a new lanyard-style cellphone holder, allows callers to walk and talk in style. A woven leather neckpiece bears a sleek silver clasp that holds keys, an ID card and, of course, the requisite phone; $85 at Flight 001 in Greenwich Village. (For phones lacking a built-in hook, City Loop provides a small superadhesive looped tab that can be fixed to the bottom of the phone.) In March, Flight 001 will have a new version with a cunningly integrated earpiece; a leather-swathed ear bud sprouts from the top of the lanyard, while the cord is threaded through the lanyard and plugs into the phone at the bottom ($125; 212-691-1001). Look, Ma Bell, no hands!
