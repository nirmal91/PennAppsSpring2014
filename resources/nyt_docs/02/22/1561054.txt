A dispute on a subway car in Brooklyn last night ended with a man critically injured, with stab wounds to his head and neck and a gunshot wound to his left leg, the police said.
Investigators said the attack took place at 9:15 p.m. on an eastbound No. 3 train that was approaching the Kingston Avenue station in Crown Heights. They said the victim, a man in his 20's, was taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where he was listed in critical condition.
Details remained sketchy early today, and investigators declined comment on what led up to the attack. They said they were seeking two men who had fled the subway car, and that there were no arrests.
