Sometime in the mid-1950's, Sister Gertrude Morgan, a street preacher in New Orleans, received two powerful revelations. First God told her to begin making pictures to spread his Word, and she obeyed. Next he announced that she had been chosen to become Jesus's bride, and Morgan's paintings began to include pictures of her heavenly wedding.
Driven by her own idiosyncratic religious fervor, Morgan had little interest in the artistic value of her exuberantly colorful work. But the art world soon took notice and Morgan became a star, long before the term Outsider Art was coined. Now more than 100 of her works, including fans, lamp shades and even a guitar case covered with her renderings of angels, airplanes and her own likeness, go on view this week when Morgan's first traveling retrospective, ''The Tools of Her Ministry,'' opens on Wednesday at the American Folk Art Museum in New York, accompanied by a richly illustrated catalog.
From early on, Morgan's ambitions were spiritual rather than artistic. She was born to a poor farm family in Alabama in 1900, left school before completing the third grade and later worked as a servant and nursemaid. She received the call to preach in the 1930's and moved to New Orleans in 1939 to carry God's message to ''the headquarters of sin.''
Dressed in an all-white costume appropriate to her self-proclaimed position as ''God's wife'' and ''nurse to Doctor Jesus,'' she became a well-known fixture on street corners in the French Quarter, shouting her version of the Gospel and jangling a tambourine. She also preached at her own Everlasting Gospel Mission, a small whitewashed room decorated with her vivid paintings, where she died in 1980. Although we cannot know if she achieved the spiritual immortality she sought so passionately, clearly her popularity among art insiders has helped keep her artistic reputation very much alive.
