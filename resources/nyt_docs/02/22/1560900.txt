To the Editor:
Re: ''You Can Buy a Cellphone, but What Happened to Quaint?'' (Feb. 8): I have lived in or near Brooklyn Heights for 26 years, and I never once set foot in Summa Gallery on Montague Street, but I was in the MAC store the first week it opened. I am also grateful for the recent arrival of Nine West and Aerosoles; previously, you had to travel to Manhattan for a reasonable selection of shoes.
I do miss Leaf and Bean, an aromatic coffee and tea shop with an outdoor dining terrace, and I'm not enamored of Subway, Sprint or Verizon. But Montague Street's distinctive arrangement of Victorian bay-windowed, parlor-floor storefronts, which are cantilevered over ground-floor shops, is, thankfully, protected by landmark status.
Stores can come and go, but the character -- O.K., quaintness -- of the block will remain.
