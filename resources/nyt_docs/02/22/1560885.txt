He may know how to run a major hotel company, but Jonathan Tisch, the chief executive of Loews Hotels, cannot make an omelet worth a darn.
Mr. Tisch will be in the first installment of ''Now Who's Boss,'' a reality series from TLC, the cable channel, in which chief executives are catapulted back to the front lines of their industries to gain an appreciation for the rank-and-file worker. For his episode, to be shown on March 8 at 10 p.m., Eastern time, Mr. Tisch spent five days working at the Loews Miami Beach hotel in a variety of jobs, including chambermaid, banquet server, engineer, pool attendant, bellman and front-desk clerk.
Each job proved challenging, Mr. Tisch said, but the most difficult by far was short-order breakfast cook.
''I was in an extremely tight space, over a hot stove, having orders barked out to me,'' Mr. Tisch lamented. He said he had made ''respectable'' pancakes, but had run into trouble when cooking an omelet. ''When I flipped it, half of it ended up in the fire,'' he said.
On the plus side, he said, ''I don't think everybody fell over from my cooking.''
For now, he plans to stick with his current job. ''There's a reason why I eat out every night,'' he said.
Editors' Note:  March 7, 2004, Sunday  An article on the Executive Life page last Sunday and a brief report in the Business People column on Feb. 22 described a new reality series called ''Now Who's Boss?'' on the TLC cable network. Both accounts described the way the series follows corporate leaders as they tackle rank-and-file jobs in their companies. The accounts should have noted that New York Times Television was the producer of the program, though the news staff of The Times was not involved.
