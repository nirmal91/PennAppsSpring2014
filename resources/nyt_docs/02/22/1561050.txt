They may be old enough to handle a backpack, but are they responsible enough for the restroom? Students at Lawrence Middle School fought last week to reaffirm their unalienable rights to life, liberty and bathroom breaks as needed.
Starting in January, a rule limited seventh and eighth graders to 15 bathroom passes a month. School officials contended that fewer breaks from class would mean fewer students causing trouble. The school has been evacuated twice this year because of bomb threats conveyed through menacing bathroom graffiti.
Some students coped with the rule by avoiding water and soft drinks, lest they run out of passes early in the month and find themselves squirming in their seats. Why, some wondered, should bad behavior of a few be taken out on all?
Soon their parents were also demanding answers. The controversy reached a peak last Monday, when a local newspaper ran an article on the bathroom battle.
''When my son Matthew used all his passes, he was then told he couldn't go to the bathroom,'' a parent, Susan Gregory, said in an interview with The Times of Trenton. She added that school officials had told her that ''the bathroom is a privilege, not a right,'' and that students with greater than average bathroom needs should obtain a doctor's note.
''Now my son doesn't want to go to the bathroom at school,'' Ms. Gregory said. ''He says he won't drink or he'll hold until he gets home. This can't be healthy.''
After the story made national headlines, the rule was revised posthaste. As of Wednesday, students were being allotted 30 passes a month, for bathroom visits or other academic necessities.
''We started the original rule in January and it was a trial,'' said Dr. Nancy Pitcher, the school principal. ''We discovered kids were not abusing the passes. I think we came to a good compromise.''
