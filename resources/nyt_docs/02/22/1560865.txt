To the Editor:
Re ''More Than College Football'' (editorial, Feb. 20):
Colleges are in the business of education, and major college sports, like football and basketball, are merely ways to raise money.
We would be better off severing colleges from big-time sports. Universities could still showcase various teams in some sort of minor league, but it seems foolish to continue the myth that a college education has anything to do with big-time college sports.
