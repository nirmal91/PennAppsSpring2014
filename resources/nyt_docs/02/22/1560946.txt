To the Editor:
Regarding the County Lines column: ''Grown-Up Men Will Behave Like Kids?'' (Feb. 8), Although it does highlight a problem with adult amateur athletics, the piece fails to discuss the leagues that insist on a strict code of conduct. The article presented an unbalanced viewpoint to parks directors and school athletic directors, with whom we work to dispel these assertions regularly. The athletic directors and facilities audience are critical to our survival because they grant us permits and access.
The Westchester Rockland Wood Bat League, (average age is 24) , of which I am commissioner, has developed an infrastructure over 10 seasons that is built on the demand for good behavior.
We employ a four-manager competition committee that each season tightens our rulebook and if necessary doles out suspensions or expulsions. We diligently track other competing leagues to ensure that potentially problematic players or those with poor track records are not permitted membership within our ranks.
We also work extensively with the umpire's union and facilities directors throughout the off-season in group discussions on how to improve and avoid problems.
The culture of bad sportsmanship is mimicked by men who watch too much sports on television.
There are, however, adult-age amateur leagues in all sports that work hard to create a counter culture of good sportsmanship, cooperative agreements with facilities and open lines of communication with officials.
J. Stephen Madey  Commissioner  Westchester Rockland  Wood Bat League
