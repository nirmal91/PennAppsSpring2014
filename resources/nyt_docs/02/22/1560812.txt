As general manager of the fashionable, futuristic-looking Lever House restaurant in Manhattan, Steven Eckler wears a suit every day. But he certainly doesn't blend into the scenery. ''I try to avoid being too contemporary,'' said Mr. Eckler, who has worked with the chefs Danny Meyer and Wolfgang Puck. ''I like to create a juxtaposition between Marc Newson's hyper-designed room and what I'm wearing.'' That's easy, since Mr. Eckler's personal tastes run toward the colorful, warm and witty -- and away from the cool and minimalist.
Here, he wears a Ralph Lauren Purple Label pinstripe suit with shirt, tie and socks by Paul Smith, a favorite designer (and occasional Lever House diner). To keep out the cold, he adds a Martin Margiela coat and a Comme des Gar√ßons scarf.
Mr. Eckler, 42, said he pays little attention to trends and seasons, preferring to take good care of his clothes and mix the old with the new. ''I like being a little peacocky,'' he said. ''My inspirations have always been rock 'n' roll figures like Bryan Ferry, Ray Davies and Johnny Rotten.'' Currently, he admires the look of OutKast, who seem to share his approach to dressing. ''I try to take chances, mix things that might not go together and see what happens,'' he said.
