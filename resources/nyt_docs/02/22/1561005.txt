An article in Connecticut and Westchester copies last Sunday about shopping mall construction misstated the year that Macy's closed its New Haven store. That was 1994, not in the 80's. The article referred imprecisely to plans for a community college campus on the site of the old Macy's and an adjacent block. It entails consolidation of two existing Gateway Community College campuses, not construction of a new institution.
