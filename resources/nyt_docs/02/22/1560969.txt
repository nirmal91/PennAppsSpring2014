Re ''State May Claim Part of Stew Leonard's Site'' [Feb. 15]: For some time Stew Leonard's has been trying to get the ball rolling with their building plans on the corner of Route 110 and Conklin Avenue in East Farmingdale. We have heard complaints from all sorts of aviation officials who do not want Stew Leonard's to build.
Challenges by Republic Airport have failed, so now they claim New York State owns the Stew Leonard's site, not Fairchild.
Stew Leonard's will hire some 600 employees, create hundreds of jobs for the local construction unions and is not asking for any type of tax deferment. It will pump millions of dollars into the economy.
Stew Leonard's also has an excellent reputation as being supportive of the community in which they do business, unlike its adversary, Republic Airport.
The aviation Goliath wants to dictate how we as a community must live. Stew Leonard's wants to work with us. I think it is about time we the people speak up.
Shorten the Republic Airport runway that faces the residential areas and tell them we want Stew Leonard's.
