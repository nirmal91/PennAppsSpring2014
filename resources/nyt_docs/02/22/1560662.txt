Clive Thompson (Feb. 8) describes what is effectively a punk youth culture of spoiled, bored adolescents doing great harm to innocent bystanders in order to achieve their selfish objectives.

Anyone who wants to bring down the United States doesn't need a nuclear bomb. He just needs to take down the electric grid nationwide, program the nuclear power plants to run amok and cause airliners to crash. Virus creation may be heading to a level of economic damage and perhaps extortion that exceeds anything Dr. No or SPECTRE of the James Bond novels ever envisioned.
