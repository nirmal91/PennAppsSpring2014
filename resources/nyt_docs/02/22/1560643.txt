To the Editor:
In her review of Elmore Leonard's ''Mr. Paradise'' (Feb. 1), Ann Beattie compliments the author on his sense of humor and goes on to say, ''He's hip and has the ability to keep readers involved, even if some miss an 'in' joke or have no idea there's a literary allusion.''
An ''in'' joke that Beattie apparently missed is Leonard's giving his ''totally corrupt lawyer'' character the name Avern Cohn. Of course Beattie, being a professor of literature at the University of Virginia, would have no way of knowing that Avern Cohn is a universally respected judge at Elmore Leonard's hometown United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
