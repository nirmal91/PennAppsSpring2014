John J. Petillo, an ally of Governor McGreevey, has been named interim president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey beginning June 6. Dr. Petillo, now chairman of the medical school's board, will succeed Dr. Stuart Cook, who in his five years in the post often disagreed with Mr. McGreevey over the aborted plan to merge the university with Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Dr. Petillo, who will be paid $475,000 in the interim post, is not a medical doctor but holds a Ph.D. and is a former president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey and a former chancellor of Seton Hall University. He has not decided whether to seek the presidency permanently, according to a university spokeswoman, Susan Preston.
