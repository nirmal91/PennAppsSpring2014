The demographics are right and the space is ample, so Fox Sports Grill, which has a partnership with Fox Entertainment, says it has decided to open its first East Coast outlet at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack.
The restaurant and bar will occupy 22,300 square feet on the mall's fourth floor and are expected to open in late July, said Allison Parker, spokeswoman for Fox Sports Grill, whose headquarters are in Westlake Village, Calif. The three other Fox Sports Grills are in Scottsdale, Ariz.; Irvine, Calif.; and Seattle.
The restaurant will feature a bar area with three 12-foot LCD screens to show high definition TV broadcasts, and from 32 to 35 plasma screens, depending on the architect's final plans.
For patrons who want nothing to do with sports, there will be no television monitors in the dining room. The sports bar will have two fireplaces and a wine cellar.
''There won't be any memorabilia on the walls and logos will be kept to a minimum,'' Ms. Parker said. ''It will be upscale, but casual: you won't be uncomfortable walking in with jeans and a baseball cap.''
