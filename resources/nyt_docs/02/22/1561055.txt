To the Editor:
Re ''Doctors, and Yet So Much More'' (column, Feb. 8):
I feel honored to have been selected by Dr. Rose Prystowsky as her dentist some years ago before her incapacitation because of a stroke in 1995. I continue to treat her son, Dr. Barry, who is a consummate and dedicated pediatrician and a true reflection of his parent's dedication to their chosen professions.
When appointments were made for her at my office, I would ask my receptionist to make the appointment for twice as much time as needed for the actual procedure because conversations with her were both educating and inspirational. To this day, I don't know who benefited more from our relationship.
In addition to the Hippocratic oath, the story of the Doctors Prystowsky should be required reading for all those entering the health professions today.
