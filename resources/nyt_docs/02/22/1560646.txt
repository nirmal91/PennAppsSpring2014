PARANOIA
By Joseph Finder.
St. Martin's, $24.95.
Despite its title, Joseph Finder's fifth novel doesn't waste a lot of time teasing out the finer psychological aspects of deception. Finder's young narrator, Adam Cassidy, is a fairly shallow specimen who has difficulty seeing beyond the immediate concerns of Adam Cassidy. That's understandable, perhaps, considering the magnitude of his troubles. A low-level staffer at a giant telecommunications company, Adam is caught impersonating a company executive and authorizing a lavish going-away party for a fellow worker. The company's villainous C.E.O. gives him a choice: face prosecution, or infiltrate a competing company to learn about a top-secret product. The ensuing tale of corporate espionage follows Adam as he bluffs his way into the highest echelons of the other company, becoming the special assistant to its visionary founder. Adam finds himself in plenty of tight spots, and generates his share of the twists and turns required of the thriller genre. What keeps the pages turning isn't the suspense, though, as much as it is Finder's detailed portrayal of the Machiavellian world of the mega-corporation and its high-stakes intrigue: who's in, who's out, who has the ear of the boss, who just became your sworn enemy. As Adam himself might put it, hell hath no fury like a senior V.P. for new product development scorned.
