To the Editor:
It's interesting that John Waters [''Cuts Off the Heads, Loves the Elbows,'' by Mim Udovitch, Feb. 8] singles out Grace Kelly's elbows as objects of great beauty. In ''The Mikado,'' the character Katisha extols the beauty of her own elbows. Of course, unlike Grace Kelly, the rest of Katisha is an old crone, not a great beauty of the day. Mr. Waters goes on to say that he does not remember naming Divine after the character in ''Our Lady of the Flowers,'' but that he is sure he did. And that made me wonder whether he was ever a Gilbert and Sullivan fan and, thus, might have been subliminally influenced on the subject of elbows.
