To the Editor:
The articles ''Bond Referendum Roils Tarrytown District,'' (Feb. 1) and ''Waterfront Puzzle: Putting the Pieces Together,'' (Feb. 1) showed the conflict that exists in many Westchester communities between preserving open public space on the one hand and increasing the real estate tax base on the other.
One article addressed open space issues as if the arena was filled with those wishing for ''thoughtful development'' on one side, and developers on the other, with only slight mention of politicians' overwhelming desire to increase the tax base.
The other article clearly reported a school superintendent and a mayor justifying the development without much thought at all, as long as it increases tax revenues enough to service a rather hefty school bond.
How can a community faced with an important bond issue not resist the urge to maximize its tax base by maximizing development? It seems more than coincidental that both of these issues are on the table at once and create a new puzzle. As long as school taxes do not derive from income taxes, communities will try to keep taxes low by increasing development. This only increases their ultimate expenses, and ruins the aesthetics and ecology of community.
