To the Sports Editor:
The Yankees get A-Rod and baseball now gets a two-tiered system. When we get tired of watching Class AAA ball in most cities, we will turn to another sport or activity to take its place.
Baseball has become more like golf. When Tiger Woods plays, ratings are up. When he skips a tournament, ratings plummet.
For baseball's sake, I hope the commercial sales for the Red Sox-Yankees series can cover the whole league.
