In late March, Fisher Stevens and John Penotti, the founders of GreeneStreet Films, an independent production company that produced ''In the Bedroom,'' the 2002 Oscar nominee, will begin shooting a movie in New York, ''Romance and Cigarettes,'' that stars Kate Winslet, Susan Sarandon and James Gandolfini.
The idea for the movie, a ''working-class musical comedy'' set in Queens, came from John Turturro, the writer, director and actor who is also a tenant in the Manhattan building where they have their office.
Collaborating with Mr. Turturro was not happenstance. When Mr. Stevens and Mr. Penotti moved into the 35,000-square-foot space in TriBeCa in 1998, they agreed to fix up the building and to sublease it to tenants as a way to get a discount on their rent, Mr. Penotti said. Its tenants now include the director Griffin Dunne, a production company for Bruce Willis, and Mr. Turturro, among many others.
More than a few times over the years, chance meetings in the shared kitchen space of the building, and its hallways, have led to television and movie deals, Mr. Penotti said.
But perhaps the company's most interesting collaboration with its tenants is the movie project with Mr. Turturro, who in 2000 wandered into GreeneStreet Films' office to bounce his vision for the film off Mr. Penotti and Mr. Stevens.
Mr. Turturro acted out every scene ''in the whole movie, including the musical numbers,'' Mr. Penotti said. ''It was so hilarious we nearly fell out of our chairs,'' he added.
Now, Mr. Penotti and Mr. Stevens regularly scour the halls for the next big idea. ''Who knows, maybe we'll come up with it while talking to someone in the bathroom,'' Mr. Stevens said.
