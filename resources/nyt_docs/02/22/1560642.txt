To the Editor:
While I am grateful for Clayton Curtiss's warm and generous opinion of my previous work (Letters, Feb. 1), his letter illustrates the hazards of commenting on a book without actually having read it. Even a favorable review can be misinterpreted, as shown by his statement referring to my supposed claim to have ''rediscovered'' that tortured 19th-century genius Ignac Semmelweis. Curtiss asserts that I was preceded by Morton Thompson, and thus demonstrates how one can be right and wrong at the same time.
Neither Thompson nor I would have the temerity to credit ourselves with priority in bringing our subject back to popular attention. The rediscovery I describe in ''The Doctors' Plague'' took place some two decades after Semmelweis's barely noticed death in a Viennese mental hospital, in 1865. The most prominent of the several books and many essays that have since that time been written about his tragic life and death are documented in the bibliographic notes at the end of my volume. Among them is Morton Thompson's book ''The Cry and the Covenant.''
