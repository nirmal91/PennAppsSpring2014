To the Editor:
In ''Many New Causes for Old Problem of Jobs Lost Abroad'' (news article, Feb. 15), you say that ''statistics on the current job flight are estimates.''
No one -- economists, labor leaders or politicians -- has hard data on how outsourcing of high tech-high education jobs affects our society, let alone our economy. We have relied on private surveys, political pontifications and guessing.
America needs a structure to monitor the trade of labor just as we have a structure to monitor the trade of goods. Without this knowledge, our political leaders risk making decisions based on economic theory that may no longer be relevant.
