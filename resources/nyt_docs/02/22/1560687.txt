The Practical Traveler column on Feb. 8, about taking children out of school for vacations, misspelled the name of a student who went on a five-month global trip and incorrectly described a parent who took his children on a 10-month snowboarding tour. The student is Kolya Glick, not Koyla, and the parent, Jake Burton, is the sole founder of Burton Snowboards; he is not the co-founder.
