Some chief executives pay lip service to the notion of encouraging employees to strike a healthy balance between work and family. But Carolyn Gable, the chief executive of New Age Transportation in Lake Zurich, Ill., which arranges the shipment of products, goes further.
A single mother with seven children ranging in age from 5 to 30, Ms. Gable permits mothers to bring their babies to work and keep them in bassinets next to their desks. The company also has a playroom for older children, if accompanied by a nanny.
The children, Ms. Gable said, bring ''a lot of warmth and laughter'' to the office. But complications can arise. A few years ago, when the company operated out of an office in Elk Grove, Ill., a playroom was set up in a windowed conference room. Ms. Gable's 2-year-old twins were among the children who played there. ''It didn't work too well,'' she said. ''Whenever they saw me, they'd come running out, screaming, 'Mom!'''
Ms. Gable learned her lesson. When she moved the business to Lake Zurich, she chose a playroom with no windows. ''It's working out much better now,'' she said.
