SOMETHING RISING
(Light and Swift).
By Haven Kimmel.
Free Press, $24.
Cassie Claiborne drives a pickup, carries a knife or a pistol and works as a day laborer when she isn't taking money from men foolish enough to play pool with her at her uncle's pool hall in Roseville, Ind. Cassie is the central figure in ''Something Rising,'' the diffuse and melodramatic second novel from Haven Kimmel, who also wrote the memoir ''A Girl Named Zippy.'' Kimmel tells Cassie's story episodically: we see her as a tomboyish child longing for her straying, pool-hustling father and getting her first lesson in the game; as an angry teenager partying with friends and beating up her father's girlfriend; as a self-sufficient young woman taking care of her reclusive mother and paying a visit to her neurotic sister at college. During that visit, Cassie finds a reprint of Goya's ''Saturn Devouring His Son'' and other references to mythic instances of conflict. These serve as a heavy-handed prelude to Cassie's story of her marathon bout of nine ball with her father. The father-daughter competition is effective and unusual, but is insufficient to redeem this meandering novel. Of no help are occasional clunky sentences, their meanings elusive, their locutions dubious. Fine books have come from close study of pool hall life. ''Something Rising'' isn't one of them.
