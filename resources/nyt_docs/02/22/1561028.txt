Your explanation for burying the Paul O'Neill story doesn't work. Many of us don't watch ''60 Minutes'' or read the dowdy Time magazine, nor do we care about your competition with other media groups. We want the news in proper proportion. Whether this absolutely major news was part of a book promotion does not lessen its importance except in New York.
