Forget that nagging doctor's bill, push that mortgage statement to a dusty corner of your desk and, for a moment, wallow in thoughts of the rich -- you know, the ones who are different from bill-juggling mortals.
There's rich, though, and there's rich. What, Elite Traveler magazine wondered in a survey, is the ''acceleration point'' where spending takes off? Well, people with a few million, it turns out, are fairly frugal: a trifling 6 percent own at least two $1 million residences -- but even those worth $5 million live like relative misers, rarely belonging to more than one golf club.
But $10 million? Now you see serious spending. Do they even know how much? Well, 88 percent don't even pay their own bills.
