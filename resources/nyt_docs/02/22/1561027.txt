When a district attorney announces an indictment, a politician makes a speech, or anyone else says or does something, that is possibly news (column, Feb. 1). If the indictment is faulty or the speech banal, that, too, can be news (or the occasion for editorial comment). But when a reporter writes something, it is by its very nature derivative -- one or more steps away from the news.
If The Times can't add something to an article printed elsewhere, then why should it bother? Maybe the solution is to add a little roundup of provocative stories from the rest of the world, maybe on the Web site.
