An engineer with the state transportation department said that Tuesday's crane accident that killed one man at the old Sikorsky Bridge would not significantly delay construction on the new bridge.
''Naturally, the demolition has been suspended for the time being, while the investigation takes place,'' said Paul H. Breen, an assistant district engineer. ''Once the Connecticut State Police and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration release the site back to the contractor, I would imagine the first order of business would be to remove the damaged equipment, and then get back to the business at hand.''
Mr. Breen said the accident did not damage the portion of the new bridge, which connects the Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways between Stratford and Milford, was opened late last year. He said the investigation would not result in any traffic delays.
Sgt. J. Paul Vance of the State Police said on Wednesday that he expected state and federal investigators to be at the site for a few days, ''or however long it takes.''
According to the State Police and the transportation department, the accident occurred when a 180-foot girder from the southbound side of the old bridge, which is being demolished, broke free as it was being removed by two cranes that were on barges in the Housatonic River. One crane was knocked into the water. Its operator, a 59-year-old man from Alabama, was rescued by co-workers, but later pronounced dead at Bridgeport Hospital. The other crane's boom was damaged, but there were no other injuries.
The new Sikorsky Bridge, which will eventually include three lanes in each direction, is scheduled to be completed in December 2005, at a cost of around $84 million.
