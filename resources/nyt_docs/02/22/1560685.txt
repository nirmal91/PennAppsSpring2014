Invoking the principle of reciprocity, Brazil has long been the only country in Latin America to require visitors from the United States both to obtain a visa in advance and to pay exactly what it costs its citizens to get an American visa, just over $100. Last month, the Brazilian government raised the bar even higher: Americans must now also be photographed and fingerprinted before they are permitted to enter the country for the first time.
The new policy is a direct response to a similar program that went into effect in the United States last month and applies to visitors from all but 27 mostly European nations who do not require visas. Though a poll released this month shows that three-quarters of Brazilians, many of whom resent the treatment they receive at the hands of American authorities, approve of the measure, the resulting surge of nationalism has not been accompanied by significant outbursts of anti-American sentiment.
The program got off to a rocky start, with delays of up to nine hours reported at international airports in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. But now, government authorities and tourists report, it is functioning smoothly. Instead of the initial cumbersome manual process in which head shots and prints were taken by just a couple of police agents, Brazil is now using electronic equipment like that in the United States and has assigned a special detail to the task.
At a meeting with President Bush last month, Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, asked that Brazil be exempted from the new American procedures, and Brazilian officials have said the fingerprinting of Americans would end only if that occurs. Even though Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has promised to visit Brazil soon to discuss the issue, however, there are no signs so far that the Bush Administration intends to back down from its position.
