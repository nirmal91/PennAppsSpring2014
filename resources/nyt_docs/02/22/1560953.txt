The Long Island Rail Road and Long Island Bus experienced drops in riders last year. The declines were attributed to a 25 percent fare increase and a slumping economy, as well as security concerns and poor weather that cut down on pleasure trips.
James Dermody, president of the railroad, said the loss of 3 million riders, or 3.6 percent, in 2003 was anticipated after the May 1 fare increase.
''We know that whenever there is a fare increase, we lose riders,'' he said. ''But within a year to 18 months, we get a lot of them back.''
It was the second straight year that ridership had declined, dropping from 85.6 million riders in 2001 to 83.9 million in 2002 and 80.9 million last year.
In addition to the fare increase, Mr. Dermody said, the economic slump in New York City had also hurt ridership.
''A lot of our customers work in the insurance, financial and real estate areas and they were hard hit by the economy,'' he said.
But because of the fare increase, the railroad's revenue increased 11.9 percent last year.
Mr. Dermody said that there were signs of an improving economy and that the railroad projects 1.8 million more riders this year. He said that with additional funds, he plans to add one evening and one morning train on the Ronkonkoma line by the fall.
Neil Yellin, president of Long Island Bus, said the 2.4 percent dip in ridership his system experienced last year was the first decline since 1995. He said there were 30.7 million riders in 2002 compared with 30 million last year. But he also noted that the 2002 figure was a 30-year high.
''With the bar so high, I don't think this was a tremendous drop,'' he said. ''It was more of an adjustment in response to other factors.''
At the same time, Mr. Yellin noted, there was a 7.8 percent increase in use of the Able-Ride paratransit system, a door-to-door minibus service for eligible disabled riders.
