A bath-and-body store that gained cult status in London, Lush will open in New York on Monday. Lush, in Herald Square, takes its cue from a country store, stocking a selection of handmade, preservative-free hair and skin care products (about $4 to $30) packed with a grocery list of fresh ingredients: grapes, papayas, ground almonds, olive oil, yogurt, honey and mushrooms. Handwritten signs, set amid fresh-cut soaps piled high like blocks of cheese, list each ingredient. Products are marked with use-by dates; some, like the company's Bio Fresh face masks, require refrigeration. Expiration dates run from several weeks to a little more than a year, while conventional cosmetics can last up to five years. Lush's farm-fresh approach has already caught on with several celebrities, according to the company: Julia Roberts uses the Angels on Bare Skin facial cleanser; Liv Tyler is a fan of the Mask of Magnaminty. The Manhattan store (212-564-9120) is Lush's fifth branch in the United States. There are shops in San Francisco, Boston, Washington and Los Angeles.
