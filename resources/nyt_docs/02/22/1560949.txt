To the Editor:
While I am pleased that the article ''Religious Instruction Meeting Special Needs'' (Feb. 1) highlighted the Matan Jewish education classes that my daughter attends and quoted me as calling the program a godsend, I disagree with the Jewish education official who stated that many Westchester synagogues have programs for children with special needs.
Sadly, that is not the case.
Parents of children in the Matan program are especially grateful since our children's needs could not be addressed within our own synagogues.
Matan fills an enormous gap by offering Jewish education for our children, many of whom have pervasive developmental and communicative disabilities, like autism, that prevent them from participating in typical synagogue activities with other children.
As a parent, I am heartbroken that there was no way for my child to be educated and fully included in religious communal life at my synagogue.
Although synagogue leaders are well meaning, the issue is challenging.
Since Judaism is based on community and learning, more attention must be paid to accommodate members with nonphysical disabilities so that all members of a congregation may be included.
Only then will the ''mitzvah'' of Jewish education be complete.
