RISING
AIR FORCE -- Joel Gerlach made two free throws after being fouled on a layup attempt with 1.4 seconds remaining to lift Air Force (19-4, 9-1 Mountain West) to a 59-57 victory at Utah, giving the Falcons their first season sweep of the Utes. Air Force, rebounding from an unexpected loss Monday at Texas-Pan American, increased its conference lead by winning in Salt Lake City for the first time in 15 years.
EAST TENNESSEE STATE -- The Buccaneers improved to 23-4 with a 66-62 victory over Fresno State. Led by the sophomore guard Tim Smith's 26 points, East Tennessee State won its 15th straight game and has clinched the Southern Conference's North Division.
WICHITA STATE -- Fridge Holman scored 16 points to lead Wichita State (17-8) past Austin Peay, 62-47, and snap the Governors' 14-game winning streak. The Shockers (18-8), coming off a loss to Northern Iowa, have won six of seven games. With a 10-4 record in the Missouri Valley Conference, they trail Southern Illinois (15-0) and Creighton (11-4).
ILLINOIS -- Dee Brown hit six 3-pointers to help Illinois (18-5, 9-3 Big Ten) hold off a second-half rally and win at Penn State, 66-58, for its sixth straight victory.
NEVADA -- Garry Hill-Thomas tipped in the winning basket as time expired to give Nevada (17-8) a 60-58 victory over Toledo (16-8) and keep the Wolf Pack undefeated at home. With three games to play, Nevada is within a half-game of UTEP, Hawaii and Rice in the Western Athletic Conference.
GEORGE WASHINGTON -- J. R. Pinnock scored 19 points and Mike Hall added 18 as George Washington (16-8, 10-3 Atlantic 10) notched its fifth straight victory and handed Duquesne its fifth consecutive loss, 86-63.
FALLING
VERMONT -- Marcus Bullock scored 20 points to lead host New Hampshire to a 78-57 victory over Vermont. The Catamounts (17-7, 13-2 America East) have lost two of three games since putting together a 13-game winning streak.
New Hampshire (8-18, 4-12) took an early 13-4 lead, but back-to-back 3-pointers by Alex Jensen and Corey Sullivan brought Vermont within 3 with 12:44 left in the first half. New Hampshire answered with a 12-2 run fueled by layups by Jermaine Anderson and Bullock, followed by a 13-8 run that made the score 38-20 at halftime.
Vermont is without the junior forward Taylor Coppenrath, the nation's fourth-leading scorer, who will most likely miss the rest of the season after breaking his wrist.
TENNESSEE -- The Vols' postseason hopes sustained a major blow in a 71-60 loss at Georgia, which won its third straight. Avenging a 24-point loss last month, the Bulldogs (14-10, 6-7 Southeastern Conference) were led by Rashad Wright, who scored 22 points.
The Bulldogs kept alive their improbable hopes of making the N.C.A.A. tournament with only seven scholarship players in what was supposed to be a rebuilding season under their first-year coach, Dennis Felton.
The Vols (13-10, 5-7) dropped to 0-6 in conference games away from home.
DEPAUL -- The Blue Demons (15-8, 8-4 Conference USA), struggling to earn an at-large berth, had their five-game winning streak end in a 69-62 loss to St. Louis (14-9, 7-5 Conference USA). Reggie Bryant scored 18 of his 25 points in the second half for the Billikens. Bryant helped St. Louis (14-9, 7-5) erase a 15-point deficit by scoring 10 straight points during a 23-6 run.
