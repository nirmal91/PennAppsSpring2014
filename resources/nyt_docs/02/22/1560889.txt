Re ''Escaping to the Land of Cheaper Living'' (Seniority, Feb. 8) in which Fred Brock described how people could retire in small towns for less than half the living costs of some big metropolitan areas:
I've been pursuing that strategy since my decision in 1999 to retire at age 55 in 2006 and move from San Francisco to rural northern Michigan. Some friends and relatives wonder why I would leave with an annual pension worth just under 40 percent of my current salary. But I realized that I would have to work until the age of 72 to remain in my current home in San Francisco after I retired. And I have seen colleagues work until late in life for a big pension, only to encounter serious illness upon retirement.
My initial considerations were strictly economic. With the equity in my current home, I could afford to build a customized house in Michigan that would be much larger and more comfortable. And the costs of living, aside from those for food, would be much lower.
Next, I considered quality-of-life issues. Here I am in a congested American city. While I love my work, I don't love where I live. I imagined living away from concrete and steel, more in tune with the rhythms of nature. My many vacations in northern Michigan gave me a basis for my search. I stumbled across a beautiful island in the Great Lakes, complete with a charming small town and an active community of artist and academic retirees.
I bought 10 acres of wooded land (the minimum lot size there) on which to build my home. The architect's drawings are going to blueprints, and the builder says we start construction next year.
You can indeed retire sooner and on less money than many experts would advise. Knowing yourself and what you want from retired life are the keys.
