A series of panel discussions and presentations designed to be of special interest to Brooklyn homeowners and residents will be part of the first Brooklyn Home Exposition, which is to run for three days at the Marriott hotel near Borough Hall beginning Thursday.
There are to be presentations on Thursday morning by a number of developers, including Joshua Muss and Jed Walentas, about plans for residential projects.
Workshops will include one conducted by Osvaldo Bertolini, an architect with the firm of Ross &amp; Bertolini, on dealing with the Buildings Department.
A panel of lawyers who specialize in forming co-operatives and condominiums will debate the two and their relative merits.
Other panels include a discussion of water issues led by an engineer who has designed water filtration systems for homes and workshops on renovation and repair.
