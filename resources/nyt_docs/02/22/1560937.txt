When county officials first floated the idea of opening a wholesale and retail outlet for Italian specialty goods, they concentrated on three municipalities: White Plains, New Rochelle and Port Chester.
The search for 15,000 square feet of flexible space is almost complete, said Salvatore J. Carrera, director of real estate and economic development for Westchester County, who is helping to negotiate a lease for space in White Plains.
Mr. Carrera said he expected the project to be completed by the summer. Financed by the Italian government and the Italian Center for Commercial Affairs, based in Rye Brook, the center will offer specialty clothes, food and other products.
