Re ''Why Your Job Isn't Moving to Bangalore,'' by Jagdish Bhagwati (Op-Ed, Feb. 15):
It's too late for me. My software engineering position has moved offshore. But America cannot rely on protectionism to keep jobs here at home. We must adapt and innovate.
Mr. Bhagwati is right that technical change is partly responsible for offshoring trends and that our adaptation to these changes will produce new industries and jobs.
I am taking this opportunity to return to school and renew my skills. Meanwhile, I wish the best to the developers overseas. As we export jobs, we raise the standard of living of others.
