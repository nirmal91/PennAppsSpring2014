To the Editor:
Re ''The R.S.V.P. Secures a Place on the Endangered Niceties List'' (Feb. 8): I am delighted that so many guests are deluged with so many invitations that they are unable to respond. Baloney! Nana always said that ''allowing bad manners is akin to encouraging them,'' and she had a few ploys to deal with those who ignored her request for a response. First, she would create an R.S.V.P. ''buffer zone'' of two weeks prior to her caterer's final count date. If guests did not respond by then, and knowing she actually had time before the caterer was frantic, she would write a letter to the forgetful guest: ''Dear So and So, I am so sorry that you will be unable to attend the dance/dinner/wedding on such and such a date. I will look forward to seeing you in the future on another happy occasion. If I am mistaken, please do call at. . . . ''
This usually scared the invitees, and sure enough they would call right away. If a nonresponder did indeed show up, Nana always had an extra table set up somewhere for them. We called it Siberia, and people learned soon enough that one more such colossal breach of basic etiquette would be met by the ultimate fate:
One simply wouldn't be invited to Nana's. Ever.
