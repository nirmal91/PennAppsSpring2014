To the Editor:
Why didn't James R. Oestreich's article ''Meet the Latest Thing in Early Music'' [Feb. 8] mention the Mediaeval Baebes? They are female early-music vocalists who could easily be put in the same niche as Anonymous 4 and the Trio Mediaeval. They're not successors to Anonymous 4 but contemporaries who have been around for years and have released five albums that were best sellers on the classical charts in Europe. Is it because they perform not just in cathedrals and concert halls but in rock clubs? Don't hold their crossover success, stylish wardrobe and good looks against them. Last year the Baebes sang at a jousting match. How much more authentic can you get?
