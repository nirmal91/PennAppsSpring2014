INAMORATA
By Joseph Gangemi.
Viking, $24.95.
In 1922, Scientific American magazine offered a $2,500 prize to anyone who could produce a ''visible psychic manifestation'' that would satisfy its panel of judges, which included Harry Houdini; it was nearly awarded to Mina Crandon, a Boston doctor's wife who claimed to conjure the spirit of her dead brother, Walter. Joseph Gangemi's first novel changes the setting to Philadelphia, alters the Crandons' name to Crawley and replaces Houdini in the role of Mina's would-be debunker with a young graduate student and hypnotist, Martin Finch, who is far too susceptible to the ravishing medium's charms. Inevitably, Finch is torn between his attraction to Mina and his responsibility to expose her brother's sneering specter as a hoax. ''Inamorata'' affectionately evokes the pop culture and idioms of the Prohibition era, but it's almost too eager to show off its research. Finch's narration encompasses a constant stream of factoids about every building, business and real-life personage he encounters. Gangemi's prose is brisk and melodramatic, leaning heavily on expository dialogue and ridiculous similes. The book's eccentric supporting characters -- a sinister gynecologist who drugs his wife into spiritualist trances, his one-legged Filipino butler who moonlights as his anesthesiologist, a crusty old ventriloquist fallen upon lean days -- career through their paces with the speed and predictability of a silent movie. Finch, though, is an oddly blank protagonist, driven to forbidden passion mostly because the plot requires it.
