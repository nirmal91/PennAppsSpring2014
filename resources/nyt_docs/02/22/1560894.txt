To the Editor:
After I read ''Bless This Mess'' (Feb. 8), two of my questions about fashion were answered: why everything looks the same, season after season, and why there have been no original American designers in the last 50 years.
The industry has inverted vision, referring only to past fashion for inspiration and relying on the fashion media of the last half century for source material. It's time to retrain designers to find the excitement of discovery that drove them to be designers in the first place.
Students in my arts and design program produce visual journals, too. They, however, are mandated to explore the entire universe, natural and manmade, selecting images that come from tool catalogs to Roman mosaics. Designers are expected to evolve their own connections to fashion from research that is not limited to fashion history, moving progressively from a vision, to a look, to the creation of a line that is different, personal and still marketable. I'm waiting for that American original.
