A man who lost control of his car on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway near Astoria early yesterday set off a chain reaction that killed him, left his car in flames and sent pieces of a tree crashing onto two other cars.
The man, who the police said was 36 years old but whose name they did not release because his family had not been notified, was driving east in a 2004 Toyota Corolla on the expressway near the Astoria Boulevard exit in Queens around 12:25 a.m., the police said.
The car veered off the roadway and hit a tree, catching fire. The man was dead by the time rescuers reached him, the police said.
Large pieces of the tree tumbled onto the Grand Central Parkway, which crosses the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway at that point, and landed near 47th Street, the police said.
The branches hit two cars traveling east on the parkway, a Nissan Maxima and a Ford Suburban. The drivers of the two cars, and a passenger in the Nissan, were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where their injuries were described as minor.
Correction:  February 28, 2004, Saturday  An article on Sunday about a fatal crash on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway misstated the model of a car involved. It was a sport utility vehicle by Ford, the police say, but not a Suburban; that is a Chevrolet model.
