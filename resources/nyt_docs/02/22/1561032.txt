Your examination of The Times's coverage of Howard Dean seems entirely reasonable, but you hit upon a much more serious issue and dropped it.
Why not audit the ''common complaint'' that The Times has been ''too interested in handicapping the electoral horse race while ignoring substantive policy positions''?
I think such an audit will reveal not a bias toward one candidate or another, but a much more serious dereliction of the journalistic duty to inform, rather than entertain or fascinate, the public.
