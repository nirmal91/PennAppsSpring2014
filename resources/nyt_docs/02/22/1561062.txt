To the Sports Editor:
Alex Rodriguez, the American League's most valuable player in 2003 and widely acclaimed to be the best player in baseball, is now a Yankee. Barring injury , the Yankees should dominate their division and, most likely, the American League and the World Series in 2004.
Now the microeconomics: The Firm is the American League. The Product is the pennant race. Fans' satisfaction (excitement, interest) is a function of uncertainty of outcome. The more evenly matched the competitors, the tighter the standing of the teams throughout the season and the greater fans' satisfaction (interest). And the higher the Firm's (the league's) revenues.
If the American League East race is over by June when the Yankees have an insurmountable lead, boredom will afflict all fans, including those of the Yankees.
