In an effort to halt the increasing number of anti-Semitic encounters in Westchester, the county has joined the Anti-Defamation League to offer special training to police officers.
Taught at the county police academy in Valhalla, the training session for officers taught by league representatives, which was offered last week free of charge by the league included information on extremists' ideologies and their criminal tactics; investigative, solving and prosecuting techniques; and resources for protecting communities threatened by criminal extremism. One session was called ''Hate on the Internet'' and included a survey of some of the Web sites used by extremist groups. Forty police officers took the course.
According to figures released by the league last week, 26 anti-Semitic events were reported in Westchester during 2003, up from 7 in 2002 and 15 in 2001. The crimes last year included the spraying of a Yonkers resident's car with three 15- by 15-inch swastikas, and the painting of swastikas on the Mid-Chester Jewish Center in Yonkers.
In a related effort, Westchester County is preparing to unveil a new Web site next week that outlines the mandate of the county's Human Rights Commission. The address is www.westchestergov.com/humanrightscommission.
