I was dismayed to note that all the letters (Feb. 8) you printed in response to Peter Landesman's article (Jan. 25) were from women.
Surely there were men who found this article profoundly disturbing. We need to know that men -- I hope the vast majority of us -- would never prey on women in the ways this article describes. The moving and ominous photograph of a young woman standing in a street surrounded by leering men will stay with me for a long time.
