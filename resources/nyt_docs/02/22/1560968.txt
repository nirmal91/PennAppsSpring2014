Ballroom dancing is definitely not limited to people ''of a certain age.'' Competitive collegiate dance teams are proliferating throughout the country, and younger people are now dancing at social events. In fact, ballroom dancing is unusual in that it creates an egalitarian environment where participants of mixed ages, economic brackets, educational and ethnic backgrounds, etc., readily mingle together socially while enjoying the healthy physical activity of ''dancesport.''
