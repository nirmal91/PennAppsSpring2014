To the Sports Editor:
I greatly appreciate certain recent articles in your section.
Specifically: ''Stardom Awaits a Prodigy, and Assist Goes to Her Father''(Jan. 23) by Ira Berkow, about Candace Parker, a female high school basketball star from Naperville, Ill.; ''The Picture Doesn't Tell the Story for Duke's Tillis'' (Jan. 24) by Viv Bernstein, about two female college basketball stars; and ''Life Lessons Began on Chicago's West Side'' (Jan. 27), a fine profile of Isiah Thomas by Liz Robbins.
Two of these articles are about female sports figures, one written by a woman. The Thomas article was also written by a woman. All three articles are beautifully written and researched, and give us useful and entertaining background stories on sports figures. The writing, female subjects (we even get to see Thomas's mom!), female writers -- what's not to like?
Thanks for these, and I look forward to more articles that might interest your female (and thinking male) readers.
