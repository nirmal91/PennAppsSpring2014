With Mardi Gras, Feb. 24, less than a month away, New Orleans is settled in for another long siege of frolicking. Carnival season officially began on Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, the signal for a throng of fancy-dress balls and other fetes. Early this month the pace quickens with parades and bands leading to mass hedonism on Fat Tuesday, with more parades, masking, street dancing and celebrators promenading in sequins, feather boas and gorilla suits -- or wearing almost nothing.
There is never a question of whether such festivities might be a tad excessive. The minute wreaths vanish from doors, gaudy green, gold and purple Mardi Gras colors appear. And the season's wreath-shaped king cakes hiding a plastic baby grow more sumptuous by the batch.
Where crowds are thick, pickpockets may lurk, but carnival crime is mostly of the drunkenness and disorderly conduct variety. After dark, as in many other major cities, it's sensible to walk only in well-lighted areas and travel in groups, among other standard anticrime strategies.
Beyond its relentless hedonism, the city has also been on a culture spree. A new sculpture garden opened recently under magnificent old oak and pine trees in City Park, once a popular spot for duels. And in August a sleek museum of Southern art opened in the Warehouse/Arts District, a once-industrial neighborhood that is a growing center for galleries, museums and hotels.
Beyond culture, lovers of tradition -- along with just about everyone else in the city -- are rejoicing over the imminent return of streetcars to Canal Street. Buses replaced the wide thoroughfare's beloved clattering old rail system in 1964, a loss that has been mourned ever since. The new streetcars, built to resemble the old 1920's models, are expected back early this year, rolling from the French Market onto the 3.7-mile-length of Canal Street and a milelong spur on North Carrollton Avenue to City Park. There will be a big welcoming party, of course.
Events
Carnival's energetic music propelled by chants and drums will flow in the courtyard of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve visitors center, 419 Decatur Street, (504) 589-2133, Feb. 7, starting at noon; a performance by the resplendently feathered Mardi Gras Indians, Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and the Golden Eagles, is set for 1 p.m. The singer-keyboardist Willie Tee and five friends will follow at 2:30 p.m. with jazz and rhythm-and-blues songs linked to Mardi Gras. Free. Information: (504) 589-4841.
The famous Wild Magnolias Mardi Gras Indians, with their vocalist, Big Chief Bo Dollis, will perform with their band in a concert on Feb. 21 from 2 to 4 p.m. in the courtyard behind the Old U.S. Mint, a Louisiana State Museum, 400 Esplanade Avenue, (800) 568-6968, at the edge of the French Quarter. Their rhythms are a mix of soul, Latin, African-Caribbean and jazz. Entry is free unless rain drives the concert inside, where the $5 museum entry fee applies.
Starting Feb. 13, parades roll almost nightly, and on weekends as well. Among the most spectacular are Endymion, Feb. 21 (LeAnn Rimes, the country singer, is grand marshal); Bacchus, Feb. 22, with Elijah Wood (Frodo in the ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy) as Bacchus XXXVI; and Orpheus, Feb. 23, with another hobbit, Dominic Monaghan, as one of the celebrity monarchs; www.nola.com/mardigras/parades.
On Lundi Gras, or ''Fat Monday,'' Feb. 23, a free festival produced by the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club rolls all day in Woldenberg Park beside the Mississippi River near the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, 1 Canal Street, with music, Creole and Cajun food, dancing and other entertainment. The music starts at 10 a.m., and includes children's entertainment. Food choices like shrimp Creole are about $3 to $5 a serving. Information: (504) 827-1661 or www.zulusapclub.org.
On Feb. 24, Fat Tuesday, the Zulu parade begins at 8:30 a.m. Rex, the prime spectacle, begins at 10 a.m., its floats rumbling along St. Charles Avenue past screaming hordes jostling for trinkets tossed from floats. To join the crowd, you must slither through narrow openings among thickets of ladders, beer drinkers, lawn chairs and ice chests. Parades persist along the avenue into the afternoon. No big parades travel the narrow streets of the French Quarter, which is taken over by a euphoric rabble swirling with flamboyant costumes and some baring of flesh.
The New Orleans Museum of Art, (504) 488-2631, in City Park, is showing a major exhibition, ''The Quest for Immortality: Treasures of Ancient Egypt,'' until Feb. 25, with works from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Luxor Museum and the sites of Tanis and Deir el-Bahari.
