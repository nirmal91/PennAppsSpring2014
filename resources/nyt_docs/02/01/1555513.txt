In an effort to bring a close to a decadelong effort to win approval of its plan for a community center in Kings Point, Chabad Lubavitch of Great Neck presented a significantly scaled-down version of its building plans at a meeting of the village trustees. But the proposal came under continued sharp criticism, and the trustees adjourned the hearing without a vote.
''The only leverage the village has is to keep delaying the process,'' said Peter Mineo, the lead lawyer for Chabad, an ultra-Orthodox Hasidic group. ''They know if they go to court they'll get spanked.''
Chabad wants to build a sanctuary and community center on its 8.74-acre property on East Shore Road. While the original plan called for an 82,000-square-foot sanctuary, community center and elementary school, the new plan proposes 23,500 square feet in all, with only a nursery school.
Many of the 100 residents who attended the hearing raised strenuous objections to the proposal. ''Why do you want to be here when you're not welcome?'' Elliot Nadelson, a Kings Point resident, said to applause.
Mayor Michael Kalnick scolded some of the opponents. ''The board has no power to prevent a religious institution from building here,'' he said. ''That's the law of the land.''
