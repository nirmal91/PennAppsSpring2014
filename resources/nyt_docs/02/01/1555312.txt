To the Editor:
Re ''Elephants Can't Fly'' (column, Jan. 29):
Once again, Thomas L. Friedman ascribes nefarious motives to France's refusal last year to join the ''coalition of the willing'' in attacking Iraq.
But could there be a simpler one? That simply on its merits, France had the good sense to refuse to participate in this ill-conceived, reckless and now disastrous adventure?
