The conflict between running backs and linebackers is often the difference between victory and defeat, and Carolina and New England's matchup is most compelling.
The Panthers' Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster represent the brute force that embodies Carolina while New England linebackers Tedy Bruschi, Willie McGinest, Mike Vrabel and Roman Phifer serve as the Patriots' spirit. It is strength against strength. Davis rushed for 100 or more yards seven times during the regular season, while the Patriots' defense allowed only one 100-yard rusher, Denver's Clinton Portis (111 yards on Nov. 3) all season. Whether the running backs were small and quick (the Giants' Tiki Barber ran for 71 yards on Oct. 12) or big and lumbering (Tennessee's Eddie George ran for 83 yards in two games against New England on Nov. 5 and Jan. 10), New England finds a way to chase runners down.
Patriots running back Antowain Smith is an overlooked player who can tussle with any defender. His stats and style are not special. He rushed for 100 yards just once, against the Jets on Dec. 20, when he pounded away for 121. But he has averaged 3.9 yards a carry over his career (3.5 in 2003), a respectable clip that should keep Carolina's solid linebacking unit of Greg Favors, Dan Morgan and Will Witherspoon busy. To change speeds, the Patriots often use running back Kevin Faulk, an expert pass catcher out of the backfield.
The Panthers defense allowed five 100-yard rushers during the regular season, but it has improved throughout.
The matchups appear even. The mayhem will be endless.
