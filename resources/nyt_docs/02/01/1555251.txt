To the Editor: Regarding ''The Accidental Roommate'' (Jan. 11), by Caroline Seebohm: I found the author's leitmotif -- ''single supplements are unfair'' -- curious. Should single New York apartment dwellers pay half the amount of couples renting the same space?
Generally, it is not the tour operator but the accommodations supplier (hotel, cruise ship) that imposes this cost; the tour operator merely passes it on. I am managing director of Blue Marble Travel in Philadelphia. Most clients of our cycle tours are single, and we offer options of sharing, or of paying extra for a private room. Those who choose to share are generally grateful for the chance to spend their money on other things.
