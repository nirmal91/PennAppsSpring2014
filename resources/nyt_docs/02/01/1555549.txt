A three-judge appellate court ruled last week that the State Department of Education had improperly removed $124 million from 21 Abbott districts, which are among the poorest school districts in the state. Calculating this year's budgets, the department deducted money that the districts did not spend in 2002-03, basing totals on districts' actual, rather than approved, spending. The state has until Thursday to issue revised budget figures. Districts that are expected to gain the most under the ruling are Camden ($21.2 million), Jersey City ($13.3 million), New Brunswick ($12.8 million) and East Orange ($12.6 million).
