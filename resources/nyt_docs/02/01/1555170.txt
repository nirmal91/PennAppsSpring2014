When Jo Freeman began her undergraduate education in 1961, the University of California, Berkeley, like many colleges then, took in loco parentis seriously. Administrative rules enforced curfews, banned political groups from operating on campuses and forced professors to sign loyalty oaths. Freeman and other students joined Slate, ''a permanent student political party'' that began by protesting racial segregation in fraternities and sororities, then quickly moved on to demonstrate against the death penalty, for civil rights in the South and for fair housing in Berkeley. They joined the Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P. in picketing local hotels and auto dealerships ''because so many local Negroes complained that they could not get jobs in San Francisco that they had held in Southern cities.'' The more the university attempted to crack down on student unrest, the larger the dissident groups grew. The arrest of one alumnus for handing out leaflets at a student-only table led to the birth of the Free Speech Movement. At the height of the protests in the fall of 1964, 1,500 students occupied an academic building. Almost 800 were arrested and charged with trespassing. By the following spring, students were rallying and being arrested for the right to use four-letter words. Freeman, author of ''A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics'' and other works about feminism, brings enormous research to bear on her heady college days. In a book that is less memoir than political history, the descriptions of some of the players and of her own life pale against the campus uprisings -- sparks that allowed later protests against the war in Vietnam to ignite.
