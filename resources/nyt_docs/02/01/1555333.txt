Austria's chefs find Heidi Schr√∂ck's whites breathtaking, especially her dry 2002 Burgenland muscat, blended with muscat ottonel and gelber muskateller. No wonder Falstaff, the authoritative Austrian wine magazine, named her its 2003 winemaker of the year. Her ethereal muscat is a masterpiece of flavor clarity.
