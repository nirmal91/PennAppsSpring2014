State wildlife biologists are looking to kill more than half of the deer herd on Bluff Point Coastal Reserve, a peninsula in Groton, by the end of February.
Ed Parker, the chief of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Natural Resources, said that a healthy population for Bluff Point would be 25 deer, otherwise they could not find enough young trees or plants to eat.
This year, biologists have counted 61 deer living at Bluff Point, and they expect to kill 36, he said. The hunts are not open to the public.
The D.E.P. has run the hunts in most winters since 1996, when the deer herd hit a high of nearly 300 deer, with hunters killing 233 of them.
A state law passed last year now allows the D.E.P. to hold the hunt at night and to set bait. Such practices are illegal for other hunters during regular deer-hunting seasons. (Regular deer hunting season ended on Dec. 31, except for the bow-and-arrow season on private land, which ends Jan. 31.)
In past years, the hunt was held during daylight. State law enforcement officers had to patrol the hunt and keep the reserve closed to the public. The culling has been controversial in some years, drawing protesters to the reserve, which is a popular walking and jogging place.
Mr. Parker said he did not call the culling operation a hunt.
''It is not recreational hunting,'' he said. ''We have an overpopulation of deer. I want to get those deer out as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.''
About a dozen people gathered to protest the hunt on Jan. 18, which roughly coincided with the beginning of the time range the state had established for the culling. The organizer of the protest, Beverly Lauterbach of Waterford, said the gathering was more a ceremony than a protest. She said the peninsula could support more than 25 deer.
