To the Editor:
In ''Should This Marriage Be Saved?'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 25), Laura Kipnis cites a 1999 survey claiming that only 38 percent of married couples are happily married. This may be less an indictment of the institution of matrimony than of American media culture, and the constant bombardment by the film and television industry of idealized, romanticized love affairs.
No one can live up to that model (not even the stars themselves in their private lives).
A similar phenomenon has been noted regarding widespread depression among women, who feel they cannot live up to the high standards of beauty as presented by the advertising industry. Many of these women are surely attractive in other ways, just as many of these marriages are surely successful on a number of levels.
Couples should stop looking at the television set and start looking at each other.
