Oh dear. First, kids toss around a ball. Then lines are drawn on a field, goal posts are installed and, in a blink, comes a Super Bowl, Super Bowl ads, vast sums spent on Super Bowl ads, articles about the vast sums spent on Super Bowl ads, articles about the articles. What next?
Well, a survey from the ad agency Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners asked participants which celebrities' appearance in a Super Bowl ad would nudge them to buy a given product. (The question was asked of 516 Americans in sports bars.)
The most touchdowns? Bill Clinton landed on many lists, though Bill Gates outranked him as best computer pitchman. Oprah Winfrey was picked as most reliable on snack foods, besting, among others, Martha Stewart. And Johnny Depp and Paris Hilton tied on the topic of beer. Go figure.
