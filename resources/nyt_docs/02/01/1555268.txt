To the Editor:
In Donald Trump's reality series ''The Apprentice,'' the women's team won the first three competitions against the men's team. And, as in almost every other commentary, Charles V. Bagli wrote that ''each time, the women have used their gender and good looks to get ahead'' [''Due Diligence on the Donald,'' Jan. 25].
Setting aside the fact that the women's use of their gender is not the only (or most important) reason they have won, I am disturbed at the insinuation that the women did something wrong or unfair by using their sexuality to succeed in business. Sex is power. Sex sells. Men have known and exploited this fact for thousands of years. This power resides in a woman's body. The women of ''The Apprentice'' have taken control of that power. Isn't that what the feminist movement was all about?
