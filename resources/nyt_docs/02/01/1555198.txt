Thank you, Julia Reed, for ''Friendly Persuasion'' (Food, Dec. 28). My mother, Mary Cantwell, made cooking accessible for me as for so many others. It is true that my mother had a great sense of occasion. Growing up, I knew of no other family who celebrated the broadcast of ''The Miss America Pageant,'' the Academy Awards and some episodes of ''McMillan and Wife'' with Champagne biscuits and ginger ale. I miss my mother dearly and am always moved to see her name in print.
