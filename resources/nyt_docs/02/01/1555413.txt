Howard Dean hurled one of the worst insults he could think of at Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts on Saturday. He suggested that Mr. Kerry was a Republican.
That prompted Mr. Kerry, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, to call for an apology and to threaten to release several pages of criticism of Dr. Dean.
The cross-country exchange began here when Dr. Dean, citing a Washington Post article that outlined Mr. Kerry's ties to corporate lobbyists, called Mr. Kerry ''a hand-maiden to special interests.''
''Turns out we've got more than one Republican in the Democratic race,'' Dr. Dean told reporters on his campaign bus. ''I've always said I thought Wes Clark was a Republican. Now apparently John Kerry has the same financing habits.
''You've heard me rail against George Bush's Medicare bill for giving most of the money to the pharmaceutical companies and the H.M.O.s,'' Dr. Dean added. ''You've heard me talk about his energy bill. John Kerry appears to be no different on this particular issue than George Bush.''
At a rally in Oklahoma City on Saturday, Mr. Kerry responded by saying, ''I'll take a second seat to nobody in this race with respect to my lifetime fight'' against special interests.
Asked about Dr. Dean's characterization of him as a Republican, Mr. Kerry said his rival had made statements about other candidates for which he eventually had to apologize. ''This may be one more,'' he said.
His campaign also noted that Dr. Dean had sealed 145 boxes of files from his days as governor of Vermont and suggested that he was hiding secret meetings with lobbyists.
