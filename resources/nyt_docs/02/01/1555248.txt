Travelers who are departing from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport now must obtain their boarding passes before proceeding to the security screening checkpoint.
For security reasons, the option of going straight to the gate before checking in with E-ticket receipts, itineraries or vouchers has been eliminated, and boarding passes will no longer be issued at the gates. Passengers will have their photo identification and boarding pass checked as they enter the security checkpoint.
Boarding passes can be obtained at ticket counters, through airlines' computer e-ticket terminals, on most airline Web sites or at most skycap curbside stations.
About 70 percent of the nation's 429 commercial airports now have the boarding pass requirement, according to the Transportation Security Administration.
