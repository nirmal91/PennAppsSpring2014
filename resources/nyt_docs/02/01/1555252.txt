To the Editor: I must have been very fortunate with ''pot luck'' roommates. One of mine on a trip to Turkey 10 years ago has become a very good friend. We have traveled to other places together on several occasions and visited each other at our homes many times.
Perhaps the groups I traveled with contributed to compatibility: Elderhostel, the League of Women Voters and Great Books. I didn't always find friends for life, but the accidental roommates were fun to be with and stimulating company.
