A day after the funeral for a young man fatally shot on a rooftop by a police officer, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday paid a visit to the police station in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where that officer was assigned.
Mayor Bloomberg arrived about 7:30 a.m. at the Housing Bureau police station at 25 Central Avenue. He addressed the officers to express his support for them, an aide said. ''New Yorkers have great confidence in the job that you do,'' the mayor told the officers. ''The trust between the community and you is based upon understanding exactly what happened.''
The mayor's appearance came a week after the shooting of the young man, Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, on an apartment building rooftop. Police officials have called the shooting, by Officer Richard S. Neri Jr, apparently unjustified, and the Brooklyn district attorney's office has presented the case to a grand jury.
In contrast to how previous administrations have handled police shootings, Mayor Bloomberg has visited Mr. Stansbury's family and offered his sympathies at the young man's funeral. Michael Heller, a lawyer who is advising Mr. Stansbury's family, called the mayor's visit to the police station ''a significant step'' in building a better relationship between the police and the community.
