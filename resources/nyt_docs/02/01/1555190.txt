David K. Shipler's article (Jan. 18) was beautifully written and very moving. Perhaps it will elicit a well-deserved groundswell of donations or even a higher-paying job for Caroline Payne. The public-relations personnel of the companies mentioned in the article will react defensively, if at all. But what of the thousands of other Caroline Paynes in America? How about a nation and an administration that has social programs in place to counter the rapaciousness of the unfettered marketplace? I would gladly pay more in taxes and for products if I knew it meant that hard-working people like Payne were paid a livable wage.
