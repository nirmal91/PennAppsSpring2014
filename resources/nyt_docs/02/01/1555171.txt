TILT
A Skewed History of the Tower of Pisa.
By Nicholas Shrady.
Simon &amp; Schuster, $21.95.
For Nicholas Shrady, the Tower of Pisa has some very human traits -- stubbornness, contrariness, a gravity-defying persistence -- and it has been driving people crazy for 800 years. ''What lies behind the tower's pristine white-marble facade and timeworn tourist clich√© . . . is a rich cautionary tale of inspired architecture and human machinations, temporal ambitions and spiritual longing, science and superstition,'' Shrady writes in ''Tilt,'' his lively and engaging account of the fiascos and history surrounding the tower. The structure was begun in 1173 as the bell tower for the cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore and took more than 200 years to complete. Galileo may have (but probably did not) conducted his experiments about the gravity of falling objects in the late 1500's from the tower. World War II brought an American Army sergeant, Leon Weckstein, to within seconds of calling in artillery strikes on the tower. But its precarious overhang (13.5 feet from perpendicular) has always been the looming threat, and 16 commissions did little to remedy it. The 17th started work in 1990, the tower almost collapsed in 1995 and, after a monumental soil-extraction process and $30 million, restoration was completed in 2001 with 300 more years of stability predicted. In his informative and often amusing book, Shrady, the author of ''Sacred Roads: Adventures From the Pilgrimage Trail,'' finds great hope in this; the endearing old cuss of architectural treasures ''symbolizes all that is wondrous and strange in a world that is fast losing good measures of both.''
