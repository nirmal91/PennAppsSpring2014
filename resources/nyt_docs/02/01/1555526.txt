To the Editor:
Marriage matters because it helps produce children who grow up to become responsible citizens. By contrast, single-parent households are far more likely to produce children -- eventually adults -- who are dropouts, drug users or criminals.
It may not be popular in our narcissistic culture, but a married couple provides the best environment for children. The data from numerous studies over the last 20 years support this conclusion.
Until someone comes up with a better way for producing good citizens, a democratic state has both the right and the duty to encourage marriage.
