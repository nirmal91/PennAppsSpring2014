To the Editor:
Re ''Education Is No Protection,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 26):
We can decry companies that send jobs abroad for their lack of compassion, but business is ultimately about the bottom line.
I, too, am nervous about the potential unemployment that widespread offshore outsourcing would bring, but are there no practical or economic arguments against it? Without them, our only response is ''What about the workers?''
In that case, can we expect the information technology industry to share the same fate as manufacturing?
