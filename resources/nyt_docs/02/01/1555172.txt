GODARD
A Portrait of the Artist at Seventy.
By Colin MacCabe.
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.
Colin MacCabe, a professor of English and film at the University of Pittsburgh, makes a point of defining Jean-Luc Godard not as a movie director but as an artist with firm philosophical and political designs. At the foundation of all Godard's films is the belief that film becomes a part of the reality that is being filmed, and by improving film, one could improve the world. Godard adopted the Maoist cause as his subject, and his career since the late 1960's -- mainly working on the fringe of film -- has been fueled by various other militant ideologies and has received little audience acceptance. ''He is the greatest essayist and one of the greatest poets that the cinema has known,'' McCabe writes. ''Godard'' is part biography, part cultural analysis and part tribute to an artist McCabe believes is one of the most influential of his time. Above all, it is a well-informed examination of a brilliant and tireless man who has dedicated his life to his art and his ideologies.
