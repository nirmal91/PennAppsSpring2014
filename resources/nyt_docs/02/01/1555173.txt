ROTHSTEIN
The Life, Times, and Murder
of the Criminal Genius Who Fixed
the 1919 World Series.
By David Pietrusza.
Carroll &amp; Graf, $27.
During the Jazz Age in New York, Arnold Rothstein became America's most notorious gambler. But as David Pietrusza explains in his biography of the brilliant criminal called ''the Great Brain,'' the reason Rothstein was so successful was that he rarely actually gambled. A natty teetotaler with a knack for numbers, Rothstein was a master of risk management -- preferably eliminating the risk -- most famously when he fixed the 1919 World Series. Pietrusza, the author of several books about baseball, does a terrific job capturing Rothstein's colorful career and sheds new light on Rothstein's role in fixing the World Series, disputing the standard history, Eliot Asinof's ''Eight Men Out.'' He convincingly argues that not only was the fix much more complicated than previously understood, but also that Rothstein played the lead, not the supporting role.
