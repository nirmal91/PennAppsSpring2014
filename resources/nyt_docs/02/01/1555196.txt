As a 17-year-old high-school student, I found myself drawn to Nussbaum's article. What I fear is that my generation, at the hands of blogs, e-mail, etc., is being robbed of the ability, and even the will, to have real-life, face-to-face conversations. We seem to be becoming content with faceless, soundless relationships. Perhaps it is not our fault; maybe we are just victims of today's technology. But I know I would choose to look my friends in the face, hear the rhythms in their speech and intonations in their voices over the click of a keystroke and the chime of an instant message.
