To the Editor:
A history of Ignac Semmelweis is good news indeed. That the author of ''The Doctors' Plague'' (review, Jan. 4) is Sherwin B. Nuland is even better. His lucid and compassionate reporting of how we die has proved that he is well qualified to tell Semmelweis's story.
I must, however, take slight exception to something Nuland says about Semmelweis that is quoted in the review: ''To receive his due of honor, he had to be rediscovered.'' This rediscovery more fittingly belongs to Morton Thompson. Thompson came to literary prominence in the mid-1950's with his best-selling medical novel ''Not as a Stranger.'' But before that he had published ''The Cry and the Covenant'' (1949). This fictional telling of Semmelweis's battle against childbed fever proved to at least one adolescent reader that taking a stand against the establishment, no matter the consequences, is worth the struggle.
So thank you to Sherwin Nuland for his contribution, but let's not forget Morton Thompson.
