Saying ''misleading budgeting is not acceptable,'' the state comptroller, Alan Hevesi, accused the Long Island Power Authority of concealing its internal administrative costs and said they had jumped 66 percent in two years, even though there was virtually no increase in customers.
Mr. Hevesi also said in a report released last week that ''actual spending by the end of the year almost always differs from the budget presented at the beginning of the year.''
Mr. Hevesi's audit found that from 2000 to 2002, the LIPA budget grew 32 percent while actual spending grew more than twice as fast. But when reporting to the public, he said, the utility released only budgeted amounts rather than what was actually spent.
Richard Kessel, LIPA's chairman, disputed the findings, insisting that the ''information is readily available as part of our budget process.'' But he conceded that LIPA's budget could be made clearer and said steps had already been taken to implement some of Mr. Hevesi's recommendations.
Asked about the increase in administrative costs and a 70 percent increase in staff from 1999 to 2002, Mr. Kessel said that LIPA took over from the Long Island Lighting Company in 1998 with fewer than 10 staff members.
''We now have fewer than 80 people managing a $2.7 billion utility, the second largest in America,'' he said. ''We have the lowest-paid utility staff in the U.S.''
Mr. Kessel added that newly released figures show that Long Islanders, ''who had the highest utility rates and the worst service in the nation under Lilco, now have rates that are lower than they were in 1998 and the best service in the state'' in terms of reliability.
''But you don't read about that in any audit because it's good news,'' he added.
