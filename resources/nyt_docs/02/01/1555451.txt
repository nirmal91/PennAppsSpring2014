Weather this cold must be the dream of every coffee shop proprietor, right? Not so, says Jeff Sommer, co-owner of the T.M. Ward Coffee Company in Newark with his parents, two brothers and a sister. ''It's definitely coffee-drinking weather, but foot traffic is down,'' he said. ''It's tough to get people out.'' Still, on a recent arctic morning, with flurries in the air and the promise of more to come, the register was busy ringing up cups of piping hot java.
Apparently some habits are hard to break, and regulars have had years to develop the habit of dropping by on the way to work. Founded in 1869, Ward's has been in Mr. Sommer's family since the 1920's. It has been situtated near City Hall for 65 years, but it seems straight out of the 19th century, with a pressed-tin ceiling, wooden barrels full of candy (20 lollipops for $1), bags of fresh-roasted peanuts ($1.79 a pound) and coffee beans spilling out of burlap bags. It also has a location at 7 South Passaic Avenue in Chatham.
Ward's brews 12 to 15 kinds of coffee at all times, including the best-selling Ward's Deluxe (a proprietary full-bodied blend) and enticing house-made flavors like Wow, with hints of caramel, coconut and chocolate, and the intriguing Lunch With Elvis, with flavors of banana and coconut. If you don't find a flavor of your liking among the store's 5,000 pounds of beans, you can create your own blend. ''People come in and say, 'I want good body but I don't want a French or Italian roast,' so we'll blend 12 ounces of this, 2 ounces of that, and 2 ounces of a dark roast to bring it to a pound,'' Mr. Sommer said. ''No extra charge.'' Now that's good old-fashioned service.
