PANTHERS RECEIVERS VS. PATRIOTS DEFENSIVE BACKS
The Panthers are known for their running ways, but Steve Smith and Muhsin Muhammad caught 142 passes, which ranked second in the National Football Conference this season. Smith is tough to cover and, when running with the ball, is even tougher to catch. The experienced Ricky Proehl gives the Panthers a reliable option. Smith's matchup against New England's savvy cornerback Ty Law, above, will be a special Super Bowl treat. The veteran safety Rodney Harrison and the rookie safety Eugene Wilson are dazzling complements, and cornerback Tyrone Poole matched Law during the regular season with a team-high six interceptions. New England led the league in interceptions with 29.
PATRIOTS RECEIVERS VS. PANTHERS DEFENSIVE BACKS
Whenever the Patriots need a critical third-down catch, receiver Troy Brown -- only 5 feet-10 inches and 196 pounds -- usually delivers it. David Givens is only a second-year receiver but deserves attention: on 9 of his 34 receptions he gained 20 or more yards. Toss in Deion Branch, who leads the team with 57 catches and the rookie speedster Bethel Johnson, and the Patriot present a versatile group. The Carolina secondary is led by safety Mike Minter, above. This season he returned two interceptions for touchdowns. The rookie cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., who had three interceptions in the N.F.C. championship game, has exhibited bold play-making skills.
The Carolina secondary allowed an average of 187.7 yards a game, fewer than New England's secondary (202.0). By adding safety Deon Grant (3 interceptions) and cornerback Reggie Howard (2 interceptions), the Carolina secondary forms a firm and aggressive group.
