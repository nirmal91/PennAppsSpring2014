The winter has been especially difficult for the Metro-North Railroad.
Daniel M. Brucker, a spokesman for the railroad, said that unrelenting sub-zero temperatures and snow have damaged the motors and other equipment in many of the 30-year-old cars used in Connecticut, creating numerous delays and cancellations.
The constant cold has also caused the World War I-era overhead wires to break. Mr. Brucker said that trains have been on ''slow speed orders'' for the last few weeks to prevent a ''ripple effect'' on the wires.
''Where speeds should be as high as 90 miles per hour, trains are now traveling between 50 and 60, and slower in some areas,'' he said.
Mr. Brucker said the railroad spent a portion of Wednesday on a weekend schedule to avoid exposing trains to the snow left by last week's storm.
James Cameron, vice chairman of the Connecticut Rail Commuter Council, an advocacy group, said the state would face consequences if it did not buy new cars and reduce delays.
''We are discouraging people from living here, and that's going to affect property values,'' he said. ''We certainly are discouraging businesses from setting up shop here.''
Harry P. Harris, a bureau chief with the State Department of Transportation, said that work had begun to replace the wires and retrofit cars. But he indicated that there was no money in the budget for new cars.
