''Feast or Famine,'' an exhibition by the Camden County Cultural and Heritage Commission at the Hopkins House Gallery in Haddon Township, celebrates local food, and its preparation and consumption. It includes Jeff Filbert's untitled still life oil, right, and his ''Bread, Empty Bowl, Self Portrait,'' shown with the artist. Also in the show are Daniel Cutrone's glass-and-steel sculpture ''Il Servizio Sadomasochisto di Caffe,'' top, and Barbara Hanselman's stoneware and ceramics. The show, which runs through Feb. 14, is part of a yearlong project looking at food and cultural identity that the commission has undertaken with a grant from the State Council for the Humanities.
