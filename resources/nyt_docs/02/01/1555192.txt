I hope the industry captains and senior managers of companies had a good read with their Sunday morning gourmet coffee and toast. I am ashamed that this still goes on in our country. Why are we all afraid to confront business about the realities of employee life? Why was that doctor so amazed that no one thought to ask employers to pay a decent living wage to Caroline Payne? We can't all live in McMansions. We need affordable dental care; we need affordable medical coverage; we need food and affordable housing Funny, a few months ago, you ran an article about women who had it all and gave it up to stay home and raise their children. I wonder what Caroline thought of that article.
