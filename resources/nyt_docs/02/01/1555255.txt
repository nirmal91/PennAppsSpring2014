To the Editor: Claudia Rowe's tale of her solo trip cross country, ''Changing Coasts, on a Solo Drive'' (Frugal Traveler, Jan. 11), evoked the romance of my own pre-cellphone cross-country drive 30 years ago. This wasn't solo -- it was taken with two other fellow early baby boomers -- and we were on the road for about 10 weeks and 13,000 miles. We didn't spend much more money than Ms. Rowe did; gas was cheaper, although it was the year of the first gas crisis, and we camped at state and national parks and KOA's.
There were Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a sighting of Chicago and the Badlands. We saw Wyoming and the Buffalo Bill Museum with fantastic American Indian beadwork. On the West Coast were towns with wonderful names, the mists, the cold and rainy beaches. Even then, there were strip malls, and areas outside cities were becoming homogenized, but beyond was America the beautiful.
