To the Editor:
Charles V. Bagli's article about Donald Trump quoted another of New York's builders, Adam Rose. I cannot help but contrast the buildings in New York City on which ''Trump'' is emblazoned with buildings like the planetarium, the public library reading room, the BAM cinemas and others that bear the Rose name.
