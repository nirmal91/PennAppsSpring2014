To the Editor:
Re ''After the Fall'' (Urban Studies, Jan. 25), Julie Salamon's account of being rescued by kind strangers after a fall on the ice, I had a similar experience. Running for the subway, I lost my footing and took a header down a long flight of stairs in the Times Square station. Luckily I escaped with only a few bruises, but I was very shaken up.
I was on the verge of passing out when a friendly face emerged out of the milling crowd on the platform. The woman made sure I was O.K., steadied me when my legs buckled, got me a seat on the crowded subway train, and walked me to my door.
I still regret that I didn't get her address so I could send her flowers. I can only hope she reads this and knows how grateful I am.
