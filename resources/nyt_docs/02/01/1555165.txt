To the Editor:
It is hard to argue with several of Ian Buruma's criticisms of Shashi Tharoor's short biography of Jawaharlal Nehru (Jan. 11). However, Buruma's defense of Winston Churchill's egregious opposition to Indian independence is, well, egregious.
Like America's own founding fathers, Churchill was an enormously complicated leader, simultaneously capable of saving the Western world's freedoms and stifling the aspirations of an enslaved people. His record on India brooks no excuse: he called Indians and Indian religions ''beastly''; he derided Gandhi (whose stature, historically, now exceeds that of Churchill himself) as a ''half-naked fakir,'' and described the sight of Gandhi negotiating with the king's representative as ''nauseating.'' Churchill led his nation to its finest hour in the fight against Nazi fascism, yet felt not a twinge of conscience in denying a colored people's right to self-governance. If this is not racism, what is?
