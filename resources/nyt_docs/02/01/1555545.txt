Bilingualism is a totally failed program [''The Virtues of Bilingualism '' [Soapbox, Jan. 25]. What is needed more than any other kind of language teaching is ''English as a second language.'' It has been proved that children who are taught two languages at the same time really become proficient in neither of them. Isn't it better to get these children fluent in the language of their adopted country? Isn't this the tool they need to achieve the American dream? Please make a clear distinction between bilingual teaching and E.S.L.
