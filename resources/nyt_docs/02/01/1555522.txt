To the Editor:
Laura Kipnis (Op-Ed, Jan. 25) offers some thought-provoking arguments, but I suspect that the following less sophisticated claims stand a better chance of convincing supporters of President Bush's marital education initiative to review their case.
If at any point in the last 20 years a comparable experiment in social engineering had been proposed by a liberal Democrat, it would have been universally derided by Republicans as hopelessly quixotic; based on tendentious ''evidence''; interfering unduly in citizens' private lives; condescending to a large part of our population; and a waste of money.
They would have been correct on all points. That a conservative Republican with a born-again agenda makes these proposals in no way redeems them.
