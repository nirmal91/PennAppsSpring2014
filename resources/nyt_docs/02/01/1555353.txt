To the Editor:
The appearance of ''He Aims! He Shoots! Yes!!'' (Sunday Styles, Jan. 25) by Neil Strauss on the same day as Peter Landesman's ''Girls Next Door'' (The New York Times Magazine) was stunning. While Mr. Landesman's article was a welcome illustration of the insidiousness of the global commodification of women, Mr. Strauss seemed oblivious to the objectification of women that is a centerpiece of his article. Mr. Strauss tries to earn our sympathy by claiming that he is not the type that women giggle over at bars or want to take home because they are drunk. This is not lighthearted fun. The violence of the title is offensive, and the image of the hunted woman is accurate. In the trendy bars of Hollywood and Miami men learn to be successful P.U.A.'s (pick-up artists), luring women to succumb to their wiles. Nearby, girls and women who have been captured are enslaved by those making a handsome profit by selling their bodies.
