To the Editor:
Regarding ''Move to Hire Police Head Hits a Bump,'' Jan. 25: Expecting Chief Joseph Burton to devise methods of making our streets 100 percent drug free is not only absurd, it is also insulting. There is no way that can ever happen, short of putting up walls around our village and searching every person and vehicle as they enter or exit.
Chief Burton has been an outstanding chief to his department and to the people of Ossining. He has served this village and put his life on the line for more than 35 years. One of the most positive decisions I made while serving on the Ossining Village Board was to be part of the board that appointed him as the chief of police. It is undoubtedly the one decision that I will never second guess. To say that the chief needs to be replaced by an overpaid commissioner is not only insulting to all, it is also totally unneeded and severely impacting on the morale of the entire department. What we need is more officers on the street, not another line of bureaucracy.
