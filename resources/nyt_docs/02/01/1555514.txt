Members of the Shinnecock Nation have demanded a criminal investigation of Shelter Island homeowners who, they say, continued to build a horse barn even after discovering that the site was an ancient Indian burial ground.
Carrying signs -- one read, ''Desecration Is Terrorism'' -- about two dozen Shinnecocks attended a Town Board meeting on Jan. 23, when they asked for the investigation and for the town to adopt clear guidelines for protecting Indian graves in the future.
The homeowners, Walter and Susanne Richards, uncovered a burial site containing at least 10 skeletons in October while excavating for a barn that was going to be built near their house on Osprey Road. Forensic anthropologists determined that the bodies had been buried between 1410 and 1640.
The Shinnecocks contend that Mr. Richards violated an agreement to preserve the site when construction resumed. A corner of the barn sits on the gravesite. The Shinnecocks demanded that construction stop so local and state authorities could investigate.
''We will not accept his willful and intentional disregard of the sanctity of a cemetery solely because these are Indian graves,'' Paula Bess Collins said at the board meeting. ''This is racism in its most vile form.'' Ms. Collins is a Shinnecock representative to the Inter-Tribal Historic Preservation Task Force, an alliance of four tribes.
Arthur Williams, the town supervisor, said the board was not aware that construction had resumed and would investigate. He also agreed to meet with the tribe's lawyer to discuss possible legislation.
Mr. and Mrs. Richards did not attend the meeting, and they did not return three calls seeking comment.
