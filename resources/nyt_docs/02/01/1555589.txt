To the Editor:
If the mayor of Ossining feels that there really is a problem with the police department, (''Move to Hire Police Head Hits a Bump,'' Jan. 25) a better use of the money that he has slated for a new commissioner would be to put more men on the street, not another desk in the building.
He should be supporting the present hard-working, dedicated members of our force and not undermining them. His criticism affects them all.
Chief Joseph Burton has been an effective, respected leader of our police force. He doesn't need to be told how to run an effective department; just look at the numbers. Chief Burton is the caliber of leader Ossining needs and should be proud to have.
