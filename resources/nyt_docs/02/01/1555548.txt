A letter-writer [Jan. 18] has a gripe with the job that Tom Suozzi is doing, giving Mr. Suozzi credit for improving Nassau County's fiscal situation somewhat, but faulting the Nassau county executive because he has ''never seen Nassau dirtier,'' what with all the ''bottles, garbage and debris littering our highways.'' Amazingly, the writer does not feel compelled to place any of the blame on the 1.3 million county residents who actually do the littering.
