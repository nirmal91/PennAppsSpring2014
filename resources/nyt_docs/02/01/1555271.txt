To the Editor:
Bernard Holland had it almost right in his insightful essay. Education is indeed the key, but learning is not primarily a matter of being told about music or musicians. It is not necessarily about being able to analyze music, and it is not even about hearing music (although that is a given). In the very first instance, learning is about making music, at whatever level one is able to achieve. Doing it yourself in music (or any of the arts) is equivalent to taking a turn at bat, fielding a ball or swimming a lap.
