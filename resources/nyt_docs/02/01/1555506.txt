A local businessman is planning to use a Boeing 727 as office space, but officials for the town of Southington said he would first need to get approval from the planning and zoning board.
David Cayer, who purchased the plane in January for $285,000, had yet to contact the town, said Mary Hughes, Southington's municipal planner.
She said that such a project would require the presentation of a ''fully engineered site plan'' to the board.
''It would be treated as if he were adding any other kind of component to an existing plan,'' said Ms. Hughes, who added that the board could take up to fourth months to make a decision.
Mr. Cayer plans to put the aircraft on the four-acre property on the Meridan-Waterbury Turnpike where his company, Custom Coach, converts retired city buses into mobile offices and conference centers. He said the plane would be reassembled to meet building codes and safety regulations. The plane, which already has emergency exits, would be mounted on a pedestal 10 feet wide and 20 feet high that would house electrical, sewer and water lines, he said.
''The only reason something like this might not be approved is because someone might think it's inappropriate,'' said Mr. Cayer, 47, a Southington native and licensed pilot, who added that the plane was not equipped to fly.
Mr. Cayer said that so far he had received nothing but positive feedback from neighboring businesses.
''They think it's a great marketing tool to draw attention to this area,'' he said.
