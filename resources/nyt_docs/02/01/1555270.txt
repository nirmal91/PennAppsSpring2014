To the Editor:
Bernard Holland asks too much of music history/music appreciation classes, or is asking for the wrong things [''Why You Can't Learn to Like It,'' Jan. 25]. The aim is not to inculcate love of the music. No one in this business is that na√Øve. All a teacher can do is demonstrate the possibility of listening to music actively, not passively, and encourage students to develop the habit of doing so. People who don't, won't, or can't think about what they are hearing will be satisfied by a pulsating monotone. But those with the intellectual tools to think about music will demand more from their listening experience, and will find it in good music of all kinds.
