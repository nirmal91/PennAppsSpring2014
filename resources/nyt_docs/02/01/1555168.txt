To the Editor:
In re -- about -- Sven Birkerts's review of Thomas Mallon's novel ''Bandbox'' (Jan. 4):
Birkerts writes, ''Mallon's opener does its job, plunging us not only in medias res -- into the midst of things -- but also, applying torque to the phrase, into what becomes a media race.'' Does Birkerts honestly believe that readers of The New York Times Book Review require a translation of in medias res? It is definitely infra dig -- short for infra dignitatem, beneath one's dignity -- for the august Book Review to condescend so crudely.
