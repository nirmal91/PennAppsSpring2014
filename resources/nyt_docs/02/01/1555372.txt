To the Editor:
The column brought to mind the time in 1966 that I had to go before the community board in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in connection with a proposed a curb cut for a commercial building on Third Avenue.
Community representatives were pained when Third Avenue was mentioned. Moses had come in and built the Gowanus Expressway over Third Avenue, then a shopping street known as the Brooklyn Broadway. He widened the street, destroying the facades that animated this urban spine, and in the process destroyed any vestige of community.
The new contemplated changes seem to have revived these memories and fears, even 50 years after the fact.
