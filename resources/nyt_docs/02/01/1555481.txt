EVEN when the Oscars aren't about Miramax Films, apparently they're still about Miramax Films.
Many in Hollywood were rubbing their hands with glee to see the big gamble of Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax co-chairman, fall flat. ''Cold Mountain,'' the studio's $80 million Civil War epic, won seven Academy Award nominations on Tuesday, but not for best picture. It was the first time since 1992 that the New York-based studio would not have a horse running in that category.
Mr. Weinstein still managed to impose his spin. ''Obviously I'm disappointed about 'Cold Mountain' not getting best picture,'' he said this week. ''But we led the nominations with 15 nominations, the most of any studio. And the contention that we don't support our small films -- this is a shining example of that, four nominations for 'City of God.' I kept saying, 'See this movie. See this movie.'''
The nomination for the small, dark movie about children killing children in Brazilian slums was indeed a surprise; it didn't even qualify for a best foreign film Academy Award nomination in 2002, when it was released in its native Brazil.
Somehow, Mr. Weinstein managed to get face time even on other people's successes. Peter Jackson, the director of ''Lord of the Rings,'' made a point of thanking Mr. Weinstein as he accepted the Golden Globe award for best picture last Sunday. The mogul had developed the scripts, though the trilogy was made by New Line. Later that night at the New Line party, the company's chairman, Bob Shaye grumbled when asked why Mr. Weinstein got some credit, and his face flashed. ''It's not his year,'' he insisted with a frown.
