To the Editor: In December, my daughter and I spent a long weekend at the Citadines Apart' Hotel Trafalgar Square, in London. By coincidence, our reservations had been made two weeks before we saw Katherine Zoepf's article ''In Central London, Four Hotels for Less'' (Dec. 7).
We were absolutely delighted with our studio apartment. Our room, better lighted than virtually any hotel I've ever stayed in, was appropriately furnished with a trundle bed as comfortable as one would want and plenty of towels.
But what Ms. Zoepf did not stress is the fantastic location of this facility -- about a 10-minute walk from the London Eye and 15 minutes from the National Theater complex.
