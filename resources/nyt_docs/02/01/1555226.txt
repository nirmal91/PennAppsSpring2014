IN ''The Return,'' the Siberian director Andrey Zvyagintsev's luminously beautiful and enigmatic debut feature, a prodigal father visits his wife and two sons in the Russian provinces after an absence of some 12 years. Early on, we sense, the reunion will not be an easy one. The two boys (played by Vladmir Garin, who drowned last summer, and Ivan Dobronravov) first catch sight of their father napping in a pose that recalls Andrea Mantegna's painting ''The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ.'' They rush to compare the visage of this near-stranger with an old family photo, which is stuck in a book beside an illustration of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac.
''I wanted to remind people that biblical tales actually penetrate our lives,'' said Mr. Zvyagintsev, who turns 40 on Friday, when ''The Return'' opens in New York. ''Because human beings don't change -- they face the same questions and are looking for the same answers today as they did centuries ago. What is love? What is sacrifice? Is love a matter of patting someone on the shoulder and speaking tender words, or of taking action, sometimes irreversible or fatal?''
The surprise winner of the Golden Lion at last year's Venice International Film Festival (and a hit at home), Mr. Zvyaginstev's film marks a return to the quasi-religious mysticism of prerevolutionary Russian society. He drew much of the inspiration for his spare and laconic style from European and American art house cinema of the 60's and 70's, which he encountered while studying acting in Moscow.
Does he feel out of step in a Russia where American blockbusters dominate?
''I do feel in isolation in Russia,'' he said. ''But I'm quite satisfied with being a loner and doing what I want to do. Especially sitting in the dark and watching movies, whether by foreigners or Russians -- this is what feeds me.''
