ADAM VINATIERI
The Patriots' kicker wrote himself into Super Bowl lore two years ago when he became the first to end a Super Bowl on the final play. His 48-yard field goal as time expired pushed New England past St. Louis, 20-17. But that might not have been his most remembered kick of those playoffs. In the conference championship game against Oakland, he had hit a 45-yard field goal in a snowstorm to force overtime; he then won the game with a 23-yarder. It should always be noted that he plays home games in often blustery weather in Foxboro, Mass. This year, he hit 25 of 34 field goals and 37 of 38 extra points. In two playoff games, he has hit 6 of 7 field goals and all 3 extra-point tries.
JOHN KASAY
He has been one of the league's most consistent kickers in his 13-year career, his 80.1 field goal percentage ranking him eighth on the career list. He has been the Panthers' kicker since they entered the league in 1995, except for missing the 2000 season and most of the 2002 season because of injuries. This season, he was 32 of 38 on field goal attempts and 29 of 30 on extra points. In the playoffs, he has hit 8 of 10 field goals and all 6 extra points.
Kasay's two misses in the playoffs came in the divisional playoff victory against the Rams. The second was the most dramatic. He made a 40-yarder in overtime that apparently won the game, but it was waved off on a delay-of-game penalty. He missed the ensuing 45-yarder. The Panthers won that game on a touchdown pass in the second overtime.
