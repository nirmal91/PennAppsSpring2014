To the Editor:
As a single woman, I thank Shari Motro for ''Single and Paying for It'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 25). For married couples to receive extra economic benefits from the government is ridiculous. I agree that the only criterion for tax breaks should be parenthood.
It seems absolutely crazy to think that tax breaks are going to encourage people to marry. The odds of finding a loving and compatible spouse are not linked to tax law.
