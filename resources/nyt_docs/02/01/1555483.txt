By now, even the most casual follower of the presidential campaigns has heard Howard Dean's campaign slogan, ''You have the power,'' or John Kerry's ''Bring it on.''
But there seems to be an endless number of other chants and cheers -- some silly enough to make even the most ardent supporter blush.
E-D-W-A-R-D-S. Oh, yes, John is the best! Edwards!
J.K., all the way!
-- for John Kerry, to the tune of the ''Olé, olé, olé, olé'' chorus of the pop song ''Hot, Hot, Hot.''
1-2-3-4! Who ya gonna caucus for?!
-- (the answer: Howard Dean!)
Our Joe is red hot. Our Joe is red hot. Our Joe is r-e-d red h-o-t hot. Once he starts he can't be stopped.
-- for Joseph Lieberman (not heard after the New Hampshire primary).
