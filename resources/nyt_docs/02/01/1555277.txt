The Streetscapes column on Dec. 28, about the building on Central Park West between 105th and 106th Streets, built as the New York Cancer Hospital, misstated the name it used at the time of a visit by Marie Curie in 1921. It was Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases; it changed its name in 1916 from General Memorial Hospital. The article also misstated the year in which the hospital relocated to 444 East 68th Street, where it is now part of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. That was 1939; the building was still under construction in 1938. A letter received by the writer from a reader last week pointed out the errors.
