To the Editor:
In Neil Strauss's article depicting the art of seduction, his reference to Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is misleading. NLP, developed in 1975 and now practiced internationally, was initially a model of top psychotherapists who best understood individuals' subjective reality and helped them make fast and lasting changes. As NLP became more widely known, people discovered the usefulness of learning a communication process that would enhance their own personal and professional development. NLP combines aspects of cognitive, behavioral, humanistic and Ericksonian hypnosis as parts of its foundation. However, if individuals choose to use NLP to exploit and unnecessarily influence others, they are not practicing or even adapting NLP.
