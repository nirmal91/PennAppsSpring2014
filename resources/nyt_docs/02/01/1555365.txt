To the Editor:
Re ''Business Schools Make Pitch for Women'' (Executive Life, Jan. 4):
Why don't more women seek business degrees? The situation can be compared to that of the math, science and technology gender gap. Women were underrepresented largely because no one cultivated their interest during formative educational years. Advocates responded by making sure that math and science classes fit girls' learning styles.
A similar effort is using financial literacy instruction to engage girls in their economic futures. Members of our group have added courses, seminars and workshops. Grade schoolers create small businesses, and older students run real-world school stores and philanthropic enterprises. The lessons are relevant, today and in the future.
