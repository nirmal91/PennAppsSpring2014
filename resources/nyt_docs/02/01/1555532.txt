As late as the mid-19th century, players exhibited mostly intuitive prejudices in favor of either bishops or knights. They were equally intuitive in working toward getting the pawn formation that best accommodated their preferred piece choices. Knight partisans generally played for closed formations; the bishop's played for open lines.
Toward century's end, with Louis Paulsen and Wilhelm Steinitz leading the way, two bishops came to be recognized as superior to a knight and bishop or two knights. That is still held true today. But one beautifully placed knight can easily outweigh an indifferently posted bishop.
In practice, though, this is often ignored. Some routine players favor the bishop no matter what the pawn structure demands. An example of this is the game between the British grandmaster Nigel Short and the Indian international master Devaki Prasad in Round 5 of the Commonwealth Championship in Mumbai, India. Short tied for first place with the Russian grandmaster Pavel Smirnov with 7 1/2-1 1/2 in the 152-player event, held Jan. 10 to 18.
The attack with 2 b3 and 3 Bb2 against the Sicilian Defense goes back to the middle of the 19th century. It began going out of style with Morphy's brilliant open-game methods, but it has returned to prominence lately, finding a home among the hypermodern ranks. One consequence has been that players sometimes lose their bearings in its new career.
Peter Svidler, defending against Short in the World Rapid Tournament last year, drew with 2 ... b6 3 Bb2 Bb7 4 Nc3 e6 5 f4 a6 6 Nf3 d5 7 d3 Nf6 8 e5 Nfd7 9 g3 Nc6.
The advantage of defense with 3 ... e5 is that it blocks off the fianchettoed white queen bishop and thus prevents White from overrunning the enemy center. But a drawback that shows itself later in this game is that the d5 square can be used strongly by White.
The point of Short's developing his king knight at e2 at move 7 could be seen after 11 f4, when he is first to attack on the f line.
And 12 f5! becomes a powerhouse thrust, forcing 12 ... Bc4 13 dc!, which makes the d6 pawn backward on an open file.
The seriousness of this becomes clear after Short's 19 c3! forcing the knight back with 19 ... Nc6. Then 20 f6 jams the black formation.
Perhaps Prasad should have stopped 24 a5, which pins down his queenside.
After 30 bc, recapture with 30 ... dc fails against 31 Ne7 Rc7 32 Bc5! Bf6 33 Bb6 Be7 34 Bc7 Nf6 35 Rb2 Bc5 36 Rb7. But Prasad's alternative, 30 ... Nc5 31 Bc5 dc 32 h4 Bh6 33 Qe2 Qe2 34 Re2, dumped him into a hopeless endgame.
After 34 ... g5 35 Kh3 gh 36 Kh4 Rg8 37 Rf5 Rd8 38 Rb2 Rd7 39 Rf1 Re8 40 Rfb1 Rb8 41 Rb6, Prasad gave up. He sees all too well that he loses the a6 pawn at once. Then Ra7 and a6 win another pawn, and White soon queens the a pawn.
