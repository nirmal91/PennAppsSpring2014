New Jersey's state garden show used to be rather, um, of the garden variety, with landscaping suggestions, lush flower arrangements and new developments in gardening tips and tools.
But then, last year, it acquired a new name: the Flower, Garden and Outdoor Living Show of New Jersey. And this year's show, at the New Jersey Convention Center in Edison, is making even more of a break from the stuffy reputation of past shows and trying to attract a more lively audience by bringing in cooking demonstrations and wine tastings for the first time.
The theme is ''A Garden State of Mind'' and there are still plenty of gardens and gardening speakers, but the outdoor living part of the show has been expanded to mean ''outdoor entertaining.''
The show runs Feb. 19 to 22, starting at 10 a.m. and running until 9 p.m. all four days except the last, when it will close at 6.
On Feb. 21, members of the Jersey Shore Chefs Association will show off with demonstrations.
One of them, Chris Mumford, a former restaurateur who now owns and operates Mumford's Culinary Center, a cooking school and restaurant/catering center in Tinton Falls, will demonstrate how to use herbs from his own garden to seer fish and chicken and how to infuse them into vinegar and oil.
Carol Berman, who is known as the ''wine chick'' on radio station WOR, will be there on Feb. 20 and 22 to hold wine demonstrations and tastings, emphasizing those that go well with outdoor entertaining and barbequing.
''Wine is primarily an agricultural product,'' she noted.
No need to grow the grapes yourself, however; appreciating the final product while seated on the deck is probably enough.
