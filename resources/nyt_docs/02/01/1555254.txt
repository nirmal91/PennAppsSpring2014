To the Editor: Ms. Seebohm speaks of having to make the shared room work on her cruise. Traveling alone to Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Russia and many countries has continued to awaken all my senses. The people I have met while waiting on the platforms for trains, or while slowly traveling down Lake Tanganyika on a steamer, or while walking the beaches or sailing a dhow on the Indian Ocean -- all these people were strangers. I now call them friends.
At 71, I have a limited income but would never consider losing my freedom by reducing my costs in exchange for a roommate. I'll save my money by staying in a two-star hotel or a guesthouse. As a solo traveler I am rarely alone.
