President Hamid Karzai said Saturday that a government inquiry into the bombing by American planes of a village in the southern province of Uruzgan on Jan. 17 found that about 10 civilians had been killed.
''There are casualties unfortunately, men and women,'' Mr. Karzai said in comments to journalists outside his office on Saturday morning. He said he had asked the provincial governor to help the families of those killed come to Kabul so he could talk to them and provide them with assistance.
The governor of Uruzgan and the local district chief have both said that an American bomb killed 11 civilians that night: 4 men, 4 children and 3 women. They said the dead were noncombatants.
The United States military has said only that it killed five militants in the area on the night of Jan. 17, and refrained from comment while it was reviewing the Afghan government report.
''Obviously, we take the concerns of the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan very seriously,'' said an American military spokesman, Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty.
''We have stringent rules of engagement, so that before we fire on a target we are as certain as humanly possible that it is on an enemy combatant,'' he added. ''But we continue to review this and we continue to refine our procedures.''
