To the Editor:
The column seems to use the purchase of the Nets by Bruce Ratner as an excuse to talk about Robert Moses' escapades and make it seem that Mr. Ratner's efforts on behalf of Brooklyn are similar to Moses' power brokering. It demeans the value that the Nets and the new stadium would have for Brooklyn.
The column says Mr. Ratner ''wants government to use its power to condemn land for a sports arena.'' If you've visited the space over the Long Island Rail Road yards that the arena would occupy, you might say it differently. The adjacent streets could only benefit by an upgrade, and the real estate condemned for this project is small. Don't associate a project of significant value for a significant borough with memories of a past czar whose track record with the disfranchised was not great.
Moses created spaces primarily for those who traveled by car. The stadium project values the role of public transportation.
