To the Editor:
Re ''Father Imperfect,'' your article about the struggles of Javier Sanchez and his young son, Javi: ''Father Imperfect'' is putting it mildly. ''Father Pathetic'' would be a better headline. Mr. Sanchez said his drug rehab ''was taking too much of my time.'' From what?
May the gods be kind to little Javi. With parents like his, he has no chance.
