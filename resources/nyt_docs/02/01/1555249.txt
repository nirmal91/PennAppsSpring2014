Celebrity Cruises has announced a new line of adventure and eco-trips, beginning this summer with 10- and 11-day sailings to the Galápagos Islands. Celebrity, a premium line featuring ships carrying 1,350 to 1,950 passengers, has bought a 100-passenger vessel for the trips and named it the Celebrity Xpedition.
In mid-January, Celebrity began booking the Galápagos trips, beginning with a June 11 departure, although it was still waiting for final approval of its purchase of a permit to run cruises to the Galápagos awarded by Ecuador, according to Elizabeth Jakeway, a Celebrity spokeswoman.
Jack Williams, Celebrity's president, said the new Celebrity Xpeditions division would add trips to Antarctica, the Arctic, Alaska and other remote destinations. The Galápagos cruises visit seven islands -- including Española, Fernandina and Santa Cruz (the Charles Darwin Research Station) -- to view wildlife, hike, swim and snorkel,. Naturalists and experts on the Galápagos will give lectures.
The Xpedition entered service in 2001 as the Sun Bay. It is 296 feet long, with 47 outside staterooms and suites. It has two restaurants, two bars, a fitness room and a small spa with sauna and massages. It will carry a crew of 64.
The rates for seven days of cruising are $2,000 to $13,200 a person, double occupancy. One- and two-night extensions in Quito before and after sailing add about $800 to $2,000 to the cost. The single supplement is double the normal rate.
