James Cagney introduced me to Katharine Hepburn in 1980 (''Drawing Miss Hepburn,'' John Kascht). Over the next decade and a half, I painted and drew portraits of Hepburn, both in my New York studio and in her town house nearby. During that period, I was painting the official White House portrait of Ronald Reagan. Hepburn visited several times to see the portrait, since she had known the Reagans in Hollywood. She told me that she ''found Nancy her first apartment in Manhattan'' and that ''Nancy's stepfather, Dr. Davis, was Spence's doctor.''
Soon thereafter, Hepburn telephoned and asked me to call her the next morning ''at 9 a.m. -- not earlier and not later.'' I called her the next morning precisely as she requested. When I asked her why she wanted me to call, she said, ''I haven't the slightest idea.'' And she hung up.
