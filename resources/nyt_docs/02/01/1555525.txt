To the Editor:
Re ''Single and Paying for It,'' by Shari Motro (Op-Ed, Jan. 25): Most single adults have the same dependents as married couples, namely, children, siblings and parents, all needing the same care as those of married couples. Our purchases, mortgages, loans and repairs all cost the same. Yet the I.R.S. insists we can handle all these identical expenses on considerably less than what's allowed for married couples.
Travel is the biggest rip-off for single people, as we are almost always charged as much as 50 percent more for trips and accommodations. In fact, I've never come across any travel plan of interest that doesn't. Along with Ms. Motro, I ask, ''Why?''
