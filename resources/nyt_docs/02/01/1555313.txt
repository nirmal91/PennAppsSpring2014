To the Editor:
Re ''New Data Show Surge in Summonses'' (news article, Jan. 28), about the increase in police tickets for quality-of-life offenses:
As a walker, biker and driver, I would be delighted to see a police ticket blitz against motorists who completely ignore full-stop signs in Queens.
This moving violation is not a quality-of-life offense, but one that endangers life itself.
