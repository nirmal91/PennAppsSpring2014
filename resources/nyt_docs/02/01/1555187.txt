In the 15 years I was an elite world-class middle-distance runner, I never took anything stronger than an aspirin. I exhorted my legs and lungs and brain to embrace the discomfort of arduous training 365 days a year so that I could be a champion racer. It was exhausting and difficult work. After reading Michael Sokolove's article (Jan. 18), I wondered how those cheating athletes felt about their accomplishments. My failures were sharp; my successes, soaring. All of it was authentic. When I hold the Olympic bronze medal I received in 1992, no longer shiny because it has been lovingly handled by so many children and friends and fans, I revel in the purity of effort it represents to me. I want to believe there are other Olympians like me. It is getting harder and harder to believe they exist.
