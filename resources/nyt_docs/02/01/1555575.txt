To the Sports Editor:
Re ''East German Steroids Toll: 'They Killed Heidi' '' (Jan. 26): President Bush has called on professional sports to get tough on performance-enhancing drugs, but it will take more than his strong words to change the widespread nonchalance about the use of steroids and other drugs.
Those who can make the public care about doping are the athletes who used drugs and regretted the decision. Major League Baseball players should read this article and realize that 500 to 2,000 former East German athletes are experiencing serious health problems associated with steroids taken during the 1970's and 1980's.
For baseball not to have a strong and comprehensive drug testing policy is shameful and irresponsible. Meaningful testing and penalties are long overdue. Without both, the health of athletes and the integrity of sports competition are at risk.
Only public pressure will force pro leagues into taking action. If fans would rebel by staying home, the steroid problem would change for the better very quickly. Until that happens, the integrity of the game and its players, records, statistics and history will continue to be tarnished.
Baseball should accept the president's call to implement stringent drug policies and for players to be better role models.
