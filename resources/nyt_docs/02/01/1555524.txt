To the Editor:
Dorothy Brown (''In Sickness, in Health and in the Tax Code,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 25) specifies where married couples pay more and where they pay less than single people, laying the basis for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. In her adjacent essay, Shari Motro points to marriage-based financial benefits like Social Security and health insurance, and asks why single people should subsidize those who are married.
While married people like me should not pay more taxes than comparable single people, how can I ask single people (some are single parents) to subsidize other benefits that I as married receive?
