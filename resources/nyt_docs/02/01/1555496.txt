FIVE years after safety campaigners killed off Vince and Larry, the affable crash dummies who demonstrated the perils of failing to buckle up, a new generation of spokesdummies will appear on television in the next few days. They stand out not for their humor, but for their strangely discordant nature.
The new dummies are children, too big for baby seats but too small for the three-point adult belts that cross the lap and the shoulder. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says 90 percent of the children who should be using booster seats, generally those between ages 4 and 8, are not, making them the group least likely to be properly restrained.
Almost all babies are correctly restrained, as are nearly 80 percent of adults in the front seat.
Children should graduate from forward-facing child seats into booster seats when they weigh about 40 pounds, safety experts say, and children should not use adult belts if they are shorter than 4-foot-9. In crashes, shorter children are often hurt by shoulder belts, which cut across the neck or face. If a child puts the shoulder belt behind an arm, leaving only the lap belt in place, the shoulder belt can cut into the abdomen in a crash.
In the public service ads, the new dummies, who are not the actual crash-test models, have no names. Though they sit like, well, dummies, they are shown with loving parents who read to them, take them swimming and bike-riding and carry them on their shoulders. An announcer says parents do not treat dummies like children, and thus should not treat children like crash dummies.
A radio version compares putting a child in an adult seat to giving him or her a power hedge trimmer or other dangerous object.
Vince and Larry were retired because safety experts decided that the people who were not wearing seat belts needed a more shocking message. But the experts reason that parents of small children are more amenable to gentle persuasion.
