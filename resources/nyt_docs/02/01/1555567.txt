As she held her second-place trophy on Sunday, Martina Navratilova told the crowd in Rod Laver Arena, ''All good things must come to an end.''
Though Navratilova has been cheating the clock for many years, she and Leander Paes were defeated by youth and serving power in the mixed doubles final, 6-1, 7-6 (3). ''It was not quite the ending that I was hoping for,'' she said. ''But it was a pleasure to be here on a Sunday, and I want to thank all of you for your support throughout the years.''
There have been a lot of years. Navratilova is 47, after all, and still a factor in doubles at the game's biggest events. She teamed with Paes to win the mixed doubles title here last year, and they were favored to win again Sunday against the unseeded first-time team of Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia and Elena Bovina of Russia. If Navratilova is true to her word, it was her last Australian Open match.
''I'm not saying goodbye to Australia; I'm just saying goodbye to playing tennis here,'' said Navratilova, who plans to continue working as a TV commentator and is interested in working on the administration of the women's tour.
