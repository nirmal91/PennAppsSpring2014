To the Editor:
Laura Kipnis (Op-Ed, Jan. 25) looks only at the negatives of matrimony. She cites a study reporting that ''a mere 38 percent of Americans who were on their first marriages described themselves as actually happy in that state.''
My wife and I recently celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. The fruits of this union were four wonderful children and nine grandchildren, with one on the way. Certainly there were tough times -- a year's separation during the Vietnam War, sickness, lots of homework, bad report cards, teenage rebellions and so on.
But when we gathered to repeat our marriage vows last October, both of us were in total agreement that marriage can only be described as the divine architecture for achieving ultimate and true happiness.
The tables have turned -- we took good care of our children and now they take care of us. We kept our marriage vows and will reap our rewards until death do us part.
