The state that spawned the drive-in movie craze during the Great Depression may well be the one bringing it back in the 21st century.
Developers got zoning and site-plan approval for rehabilitating the old Delsea Drive-In in Vineland. Although the Delsea has been closed for 16 years and its concession stand and ticket booth are a tangle of overgrown trees, rusted metal and cracking concrete, the big screen is still intact and ready to roll.
''We're looking to possibly have the drive-in open by this summer,'' said Bob Olivio, co-owner of Venture Realty in Vineland, who said he is helping put together the deal for 4D's, a development partnership there. ''It will be a family-oriented facility, and I think we'll do well.''
Mr. Olivio said the 17-acre site would also have a 23,000-square-foot indoor skateboard park and a family-style restaurant. The drive-in, which once had more than 500 spaces, will be cut to 334. And although the developers plan to keep the old speaker stands for nostalgia's sake, the refurbished drive-in will employ new technology and allow patrons to hear movies on their car radios. The concession stand and ticket booth will have to be rebuilt, but the old 50's-style sign out front along Delsea Drive will be dusted off and cleaned up.
The project will cost about $1.8 million, he said, with the Urban Enterprise Zone guaranteeing a 3 percent loan to cover a third of that.
When it comes to New Jersey and drive-ins, it seems that everything old is new again. Last year, the owners of the Wall Speedway in Wall Township announced plans to open a drive-in next to the speedway track this summer. Of course, the nation's first drive-in was erected in 1933 in Pennsauken.
