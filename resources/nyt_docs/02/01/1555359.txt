Martha Stewart has always been known as homemaker extraordinaire, but fashion diva? Yes, according to Steve Cojocaru, the former People magazine editor who is now a style correspondent for ''Entertainment Tonight.''
Last week, the mop-haired Mr. Cojocaru raved about Ms. Stewart's ''courthouse chic.'' He compared the style that she displayed on the way to her Manhattan trial on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and securities fraud to that of actresses like Uma Thurman and Gwyneth Paltrow.
Mr. Cojocaru said, ''It might be painful to face a jury, but if you're going to face a jury, you might as well look fabulous!''
Other commentators have remarked upon Ms. Stewart's pricey Herm√®s bag and kicky short boots. Mr. Cojocaru, known as much for his enthusiasm as his fashion dictates, homed in on her ''honey gold highlights'' and plush full-length winter coat.
Mr. Cojocaru declared: ''You're the new Gwyneth, as far as I'm concerned. Fashion verdict: Not guilty! Case dismissed!''
Ms. Stewart undoubtedly hopes the jury feels the same way.
