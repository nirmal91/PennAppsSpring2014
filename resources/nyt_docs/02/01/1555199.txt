I could not take my eyes away from your picture of Carolyn Heilbrun (''Choosing Death,'' Katha Pollitt). It struck me as a kind of icon of all I hold dear in life: a sunny room with a large window, bookcases full of books, a contoured chair with a footrest, a table with a canister full of pencils, a strong light over the shoulder and, at the center of the picture, a very relaxed English professor reading a book. What a joy just to imagine the abundance of life that must have taken place in that room.
The note she wrote just before she died: ''The journey is over.'' Perhaps the journey was just beginning. Having never met her in life, I shall carry the picture of her in my heart forever.
