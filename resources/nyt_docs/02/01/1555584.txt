To the Editor:
The article ''What's the Problem Officer?'' (Jan. 18) was not only timely, it was necessary.
If the police want to corral drivers at excessive speeds, they should watch the Saw Mill River Parkway North between Chappaqua and Katonah. I often go that way, and while going 50 to 55 miles per hour I am left in the ''dust.''
