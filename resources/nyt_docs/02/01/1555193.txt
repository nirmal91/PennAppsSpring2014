Charles Siebert's essay (Jan. 18) touched my heart. Except for a few details, his experience mirrored mine. A few years ago, I met a woman who was being tugged past my building by a beautiful white pit bull. The woman, who already had a houseful of cats, had found the dog roaming in the South Bronx, felt sorry for it and took it home. She frantically asked if I knew anyone who might adopt it. I didn't, but I offered to train Eva, as we subsequently named her. I taught her to sit, come and walk on a leash. I took her to my country house for a week of romping. She was so gentle I could take a bone out of her mouth. But I had two dogs of my own and was unable to keep her.
After months of trying to find her a good home, we found a couple who already had three pit bulls that they had rescued. We gave them Eva. I never saw her again, and like Siebert, I can only hope things worked out.
