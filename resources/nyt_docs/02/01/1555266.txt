Re ''Take My Broadway Role, Please!'' by Liesl Schillinger [Jan. 25]:
This past fall, when I saw the touring ''Hairspray'' here in Baltimore, I wondered what I would miss most from the Broadway production I saw in 2002. Would it be Harvey? Marissa? Kerry? No, it was Jackie Hoffman. Every time she stepped on the stage, it had been hysterical magic.
