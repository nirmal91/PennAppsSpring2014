MADAME BOVARY, C'EST MOI!
The Great Characters of Literature
and Where They Came From.
By André Bernard.
Norton, $19.95.
Asked where he got his characters, Kurt Vonnegut quipped, ''Cincinnati.'' Philip Roth likened his fictional alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, to an act of impersonation. Most famously, Gustave Flaubert claimed that ''Madame Bovary, c'est moi!'' André Bernard, the author of ''Rotten Rejections,'' displays a light touch throughout this alphabetical compendium of famous fictional characters, beginning with Adam Dalgliesh (P. D. James named the well-read detective after an English teacher) and concluding with Yossarian (Joseph Heller reworked his hero's name from the name of a soldier with whom he was stationed in Corsica in World War II). Not surprisingly, Bernard finds that many authors of children's literature happened upon their inventions in the course of entertaining their own children or those of their friends. But one can only speculate what Stephen King's children think about their father's acknowledgment that the character of Jack Torrance, the mad, murderous author in ''The Shining,'' sprang from his parental frustration and anger in the course of what he had hoped would be a quiet vacation with them at an empty resort hotel.
