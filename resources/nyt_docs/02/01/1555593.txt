JAKE DELHOMME
Conventional wisdom has it that Jake Delhomme is this year's Tom Brady: a heretofore unknown quarterback, solid but unspectacular, who took over the starting job during the season and leads his team to the Super Bowl. It's a fair comparison, to a point. Delhomme, like Brady, is accurate. Delhomme completed 59.2 percent of his passes, with 19 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, while Brady completed 60.2 percent of his, for 23 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.
Delhomme, like Brady, has shown a flair for big moments. He threw a 69-yard touchdown pass in the second overtime to beat St. Louis in the playoffs, and in his first three postseason starts, he has compiled a quarterback rating of 102.6 while throwing for three touchdowns with just one interception. Still, the Patriots want to put the game in Delhomme's inexperienced hands
TOM BRADY
The Panthers don't want the game in Brady's hands. He is 5-0 in the postseason, and he has thrown just two interceptions in those games. But Brady's nascent legend has been forged through the crucible of a Super Bowl championship and if he was unheralded when he took the Patriots to the title in 2001, those days are long over.
At 26, Brady is going for his second championship and drawing comparisons to Joe Montana from, of all people, Bill Walsh. He is exceptionally adept at the short passes that are the backbone of the Patriots offense. Even Coach Bill Belichick marvels at Brady's decision-making ability -- he rarely makes a mistake and even when his passes miss, they are always to the right man. In a game that is expected to be low-scoring and defense-intensive, Brady's Montana-like cool could be his edge.
