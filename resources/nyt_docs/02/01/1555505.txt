Last week, the captain of the Jimmy Carter, under construction at Electric Boat in Groton, was relieved of his command, the third submarine captain based out of Groton to be relieved in the last two years.
A Navy statement said last week's action was ''due to a loss of confidence'' in the officer's ability to command.
For Cmdr. David J. Bartholomew, who took command of the submarine about a year ago and was the 2003 winner of the Jack Darby Award for Inspirational Leadership and Excellence of Command, it was an abrupt end to a highly promising career.
Navy officials said the actions taken against the three captains were unrelated and did not represent a widespread problem.
Lt. Philip R. Rosi, a Navy spokesman, said the Navy characterized it as an unrelated string of unfortunate incidents.
''They're all completely different cases,'' he said. ''Unique would be a better way to characterize them.''
In February 2002, the captain of the U.S.S. Augusta was relieved as a result of conditions on the ship, and last October the captain of the U.S.S. Hartford was relieved when he ran his ship aground off Sardinia.
Lieutenant Rossi said an investigation was continuing on Commander Bartholomew. He also said that he could not go into detail about the allegations, but ''the decisions made by Commander Bartholomew led to or could have led to the degradation of good order and discipline.''
Crews are assigned to the shipyard to oversee the final stages of construction and begin training on ship systems. Jimmy Carter is supposed to join the fleet in 2005.
''It's extremely unusual to have this many events in one port,'' said John C. Markowicz of Waterford, a retired Navy captain. ''But, in part, it reflects the rigors and demands of the assignment. Being the commander of a nuclear submarine is a consuming responsibility, in port or at sea. There are stress levels associated with that, and some of them can take a toll.''
