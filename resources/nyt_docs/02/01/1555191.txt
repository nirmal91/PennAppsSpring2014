It wasn't that Wal-Mart failed to promote hard-working Caroline Payne that finally got to me; it was that no one took the trouble to call her about her shift change, sparing her an unnecessary walk to work. Whatever savings I get on paper towels and detergent is not worth supporting such a basic and utter lack of common courtesy.
