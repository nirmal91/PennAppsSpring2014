To the Editor: I too took the cruise of my dreams last fall as a single woman. My experience, however, was quite the opposite of Ms. Seebohm's. After three days of strained but cordial relations in a Budapest hotel before the cruise, my roommate was late for the ship sailing. When I innocently asked, ''Would a plane have waited?'' her response was ''The gloves are off!''
She was afraid that I would make her ill with my cough and that if I hadn't booked so late she would still be alone in her cabin. (I was not ill.) The tour director and the management staff kindly moved me to another cabin.
The result was the opportunity to meet many more people than I probably would have, and a fabulous trip overall. Would I do it again? Like the writer, I would say maybe, maybe not.
