An article on Jan. 11 about the spread of AIDS through drug users' use of dirty needles misstated the number of people in New Jersey infected with the AIDS virus, H.I.V., and the number of those with AIDS. Last June 30, according to the state Department of Health and Senior Services, 14,383 people, not 61,698, were infected, and 16,364 people, not 45,256, had AIDS. Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's, according to the state, 61,698 cases of H.I.V. and AIDS have been reported; of those infected, 45,256 have died.
