It is perhaps no surprise that Rye Brook's talk of seceding from the Town of Rye did not rise to the level of musket fire, let alone legal separation. In a report released last week, a Rye Brook panel that convened last summer to study the issue of Rye Brook separating from Rye said the idea could not proceed.
''We came to the conclusion that basically it was a financial wash,'' said Paul S. Rosenberg, committee chairman and a Rye Brook trustee, speaking by phone. ''We couldn't prove that there was a financial reason to go forward and we couldn't prove that there was financial reason not to go forward.'' That, combined with the fact that the support of other villages under the umbrella of the Town of Rye, like Port Chester, did not seem even remotely forthcoming, meant that the idea is currently dead.
