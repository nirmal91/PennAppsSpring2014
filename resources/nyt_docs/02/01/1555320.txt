Back before the advent of rampant litigation and fancy Brooklyn pierside restaurants, firefighters in the marine fireboat station on Fulton Ferry Landing had a little wooden shack that they used for target practice. They used to set the shack on fire, and a fireboat would put it out.
The firehouse closed in the 1970's, and today the 78-year-old building is a landmark, home to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. The shack, a kind of satellite structure a few feet away, has been used in recent years as storage for the factory, and as an ice cream kiosk.
But perhaps the shack missed its old calling, because on a hot night last July it caught fire. Since then, it has been boarded up while its various caretakers figure out how to rebuild it.
The city's Economic Development Corporation, which owns the property, has approved a rebuilding plan. The main leaseholder, Buzzy O'Keeffe, who also owns the nearby River Cafe, is responsible for the reconstruction and must now take that plan to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for approval.
But according to Mark Thompson, who owns the ice cream factory, the plan hit a snag when a blueprint for renovations done in the 1990's showed elements that had never actually ended up on the shack. ''The blueprints specify copper clad on the windows, vents on the side for air movement, a cupola,'' he said, noting that none of these were built but that the commission may require them on the renovated shack.
Robert Tierney, landmarks commissioner, said his department had not yet heard a proposal for the shack. Mr. O'Keeffe estimated the renovation would cost $50,000 to $100,000, and added that he didn't understand why the shack had been declared a landmark in the first place.
''As I understand it, the firemen would set fire to it regularly,'' he said. ''There was nothing substantial to it; it was just a shed. You could build something like it in a couple of days in your backyard.''
