Two sights define Paris: the Eiffel Tower and the entrances for the MÃ©tro, some of which have disappeared into museums and collections over the past few decades. Between 1900 and 1904 Hector Guimard produced the subway's marquees and railings, stunning gems of art nouveau, the sinuously curvilinear design style inspired by nature that became the dominant international architectural, furniture, and graphic movement from the mid-1890's until just before World War I. Guimard was the movement's most inventive proponent, probably the most prolific in any medium, and decidedly the most eccentric, given the excessive floriated madness that characterizes even his most simplified creations. Although some of the exquisitely decorative work in wood, metal, ceramic, and stone has been destroyed, enough has been preserved to illustrate the beautifully produced HECTOR GUIMARD: Architect, Designer 1867/1942 (Delano Greenidge Editions, $85). Through color photographs of buildings and details, as well as painstakingly researched original drawings, sketches, blueprints and other historical documentation related to the design of everything from intricate banisters and window frames to innovative cemetery memorials to casts of building numbers, Guimard's style is not just resurrected from the past but made to appear almost new.
