RESTORED CADILLAC -- Renovated Miami Beach hotels are reopening all the time, it seems. One of the latest is the Courtyard by Marriott, a 263-room property in the 1940's Cadillac Hotel on Collins Avenue, not far from South Beach. There are introductory rates starting at $129 a night weekdays and $169 weekends, plus tax, through Nov. 30, and an oceanfront pool and exercise room. Information: (305) 538-3373 or www.marriott.com/miabh.
BETTER WHEELS -- Travelers from the United States who book a European car rental with Alamo through March 31, for rentals completed by June 30, will receive a free upgrade, going up to a compact for the price of an economy car, or getting an intermediate for a compact price. The deal is good in Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. For information, go to www.alamo.com.
NO WHEELS AT ALL -- Santa Barbara, Calif., wants to reduce pollution, and to that end, it has put together the Santa Barbara Car Free Vacation Package. Mention that name when reserving at one of 17 hotels in the city, and the rates will be discounted 10 to 50 percent, depending on availability and subject to restrictions. Hotels include Brisas del Mar, the Harbor View Inn, the Hotel Oceana, the Inn of the Spanish Garden and the Upham Hotel. Register at www.santabarbaracarfree.org for a free-companion coupon good on the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner or Coast Starlight (subject to restrictions). Information: (805) 696-1100.
TAX-FREE LODGING -- To help ease the April 15 blues, the Pan Pacific San Francisco will not charge guests the standard 14 percent hotel tax in April. Rates start at $169 a night. Also, now through April, for guests who add a night to their stay, the extra night is $99 if it is a Sunday or Monday night. The hotel is at 500 Post Street, a block from Union Square. It has a fitness center and 24-hour room service; (800) 533-6465 or www.panpacific.com.
MERCURIAL PRICING -- This winter, any lodging in Snowville faces a hard sell. But for a two-night package at the Snowvillage Inn in Snowville, N.H., six miles south of Conway, N.H., dropping temperatures can bring a drop in price. The starting rate is $399 a couple (plus tax and tips) for two nights' lodging, full breakfasts each morning, one dinner for two and two one-day lift tickets at King Pine or Cranmore. But if the daytime temperature does not top 10 degrees Fahrenheit, the room cost drops 50 percent ($75 that night). If the temperature does not get above zero, the discount is 75 percent, or just over $110 that night. If it stays below zero for the entire stay, it's $298 off (the costs of the dinner and lift tickets are exempted). Blackout dates are Feb. 13 to 15. Information: (800) 447-4345, www.snowvillageinn.com.
