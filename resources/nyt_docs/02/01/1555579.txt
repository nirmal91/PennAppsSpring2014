To the Sports Editor:
I was reminded once again by the headline ''Lindros Sustains Another Concussion'' (Jan. 29) what a violent sport hockey is. When I see footage of pro hockey games on TV, it most often is of players fighting, crashing into walls and striking each other with sticks.
Is this violence really necessary? Is it what fans want? What are the referees there for? Why would players like Eric Lindros continue to put up with such abuse? Am I just a sissy for not seeing the need for what seems to be today's equivalent of gladiatorial contests: simply condoned violence in the name of sports?
