In his Soapbox essay ''... and Citizenship for Latinos'' [Jan. 25], the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez asks for citizenship for every Latino immigrant. I believe every legal immigrant, no matter what nationality, should be encouraged to become a citizen.
However illegal immigrants, called undocumented workers by Mr. Ramirez, should not be allowed to have amnesty or become citizens. These people have knowingly broken the law by entering and staying in this country. Illegal immigrants take away thousands of entry-level jobs that could otherwise go to unemployed American citizens. Additionally, allowing illegal immigrants to stay makes those who wait years to immigrate legally to this country look like fools.
Any country has to be able to control its borders. Allowing illegal immigrants to enter and stay in this country is irrational.
