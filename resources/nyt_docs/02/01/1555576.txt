To the Sports Editor:
As the co-host of the Jackie Robinson conference in 1997 at Long Island University's Brooklyn campus, I take strong exception to William C. Rhoden's column (''Nets Have Their Place, but It Isn't Brooklyn,'' Jan. 23).
Rhoden, who spoke at our conference, cavalierly dismisses the fraternal bond of Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese. He denigrates the Nets' probable move to Brooklyn as ''dreams and nostalgia.'' Rhoden prefers Newark. What Rhoden ignores, however, is the inability of New Jersey to support a first-rate basketball team.
Brooklyn, on the other hand, has suffered the Dodgers' departure despite a vast population of erudite fans and sports mavens steeped in history. Youngsters can gain entry to the new sports palace with a modern resurrection of the G.O. card process, which enabled my friends and me to enjoy the Rangers as well as the Knicks at reasonable cost.
Instead of disrespect, the urban pioneer Bruce C. Ratner and our ebullient borough president, Marty Markowitz, deserve high praise for their vision of a bright Brooklyn future.
