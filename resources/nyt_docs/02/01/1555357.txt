Few jobs are as tough as the one David R. Oliver Jr. just gave up. Unless it's the one he's taking on.
Until recently, he worked for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, where, as director of management and budget, he was involved in a host of things, from economic reconstruction to creation of a new currency.
Last week, Mr. Oliver was appointed chief operating officer of EADS North America, making him what you might call the leading salesman for Airbus, the European aviation company.
His first challenge will be competing for government contracts with Boeing, which Airbus, an EADS unit, passed last year to become the world's largest commercial aviation company.
But Mr. Oliver knows a thing or two about military matters. Just take a look at his résumé, which includes a stint at Northrop Grumman and at the Pentagon, where he served as an under secretary of defense. And oh, yes, he retired from the Navy in 1995 as a rear admiral.
