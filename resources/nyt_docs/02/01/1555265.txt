To the Editor:
Re ''Among the Jackson Faithful'' by Michael Joseph Gross [Jan. 25]:
Sooner, rather than later, many of those fans concerned about Michael Jackson's prosecution will find they can't get a decent job, more pay in the job they have, affordable housing, health insurance, help for a disabled parent or needed medication. They may find they can't afford the cost of going back to school to train for a better job. They may even lose a family member in a needless war.
And they will never know that at least some of this could have been avoided if they had devoted their time and energy to Sacramento and Washington rather than to Michael Jackson.
