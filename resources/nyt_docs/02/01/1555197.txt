Of all the essays in the Lives They Lived (Dec. 28) issue, the one that touched me the most was ''Doris of Rego Park,'' by Nicholas Dawidoff. It moved me like no other piece and elevated your issue to a higher level.
Doris wasn't famous, but she is a testimony to a cultural phenomenon in which ordinary -- often invisible -- people can be appreciated by many who would normally not even notice them. I never listened to Doris on WFAN, but I'm glad you told me about her.
