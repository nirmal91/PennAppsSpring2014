To the Editor:
Re: ''What's the Problem, Officer?'': I agree that speeding on our local roads has become quite prevalent.
But the article omitted mentioning one increasingly dangerous pattern. If you obey the posted speed limit, there will certainly be an aggressive driver right up on your bumper flashing his lights or worse yet, passing you (regardless of the double lines). Such actions have become the norm, especially on Mahopac Avenue in Somers. Signs don't seem to matter and, unfortunately, an occasional police presence is not a sufficient deterrent either.
