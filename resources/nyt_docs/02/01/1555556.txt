A little over five years ago, Lewis Katz was looking like the savior of professional sports in New Jersey. He was the lead voice of the new partnership buying the New Jersey Nets, and he was bent on keeping them in the state.
Mr. Katz even persuaded his main partner, Raymond Chambers, to join him in forming a nonprofit company, Community Youth Organization, to control the team's assets and spin off profits for urban development and charitable projects. He was vocal when he bought the team, reminiscing about growing up poor in Camden and how he wanted to give back to community. Initially as good as his word, he made a donation to help convert an old synagogue in Camden to a Boys and Girls Club and advocated building an arena in Newark.
But now Mr. Katz is at the top of the vilification list of New Jersey fans, and he is not returning telephone calls . The Web site www.joenetsfan.com blames him for selling the team to Bruce Ratner, who plans to move the Nets to a new complex in Brooklyn. Worse, they say, the same Lewis Katz will be a partner in the development with Mr. Ratner. Mr. Katz had a 38 percent stake in the team when it was bought for $150 million and then sold for $300 million.
Fans are protesting not so much the sale of the team, but that it could have been sold to the developer Charles Kushner and Senator Jon Corzine, whose bid matched Mr. Ratner's and whose desire was to keep the team in New Jersey.
''Katz is universally despised here in New Jersey, based on the e-mails I've been getting to the joenetsfan.com site,'' says Mike Kozlowski of Waldwick, who runs the Web site has organized protests of the team's sale. ''He sold out.''
