Neither Carolina nor New England boasts the league's flashiest special teams. They are not threats to score every time the ball goes in the air. Both, however, fulfill the only true requirement of winning teams: being solid and dependable on both return and coverage teams. Neither gave up a kick-return touchdown this season. Each allowed a single punt return for a touchdown.
PANTHERS
They rely on Rod Smart on kickoff returns. He has rewarded them with one 100-yard return for a touchdown this season, and he averages 23.1 yards a return. The team ranks 10th in kickoff-return yardage and 13th in punt-return average. Punt returns are handled by Steve Smith, who had one 53-yard return for a touchdown and averaged 10 yards a return.
PATRIOTS
Bethel Johnson had one 92-yard kickoff return for the Patriots, who ranked fourth in the N.F.L. in kickoff-return yardage. Troy Brown handles most of the punt-return duties, averaging 10.1 yards but not breaking free for a return touchdown this season.
PUNTING GAME
Punting is where you will find the only true disparity between these teams, although some of New England's lack of success can be traced to the unfriendly weather in Foxboro, which included two games played in snow and bitter cold. Ken Walter averaged only 37.7 yards a kick. Carolina's Todd Sauerbrun, in contrast, has one of the league's strongest legs, averaging 44.4 yards a kick and lifting the Panthers to third in the N.F.L. in punting average.
