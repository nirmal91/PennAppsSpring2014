As part of the Victoria and Albert's 10-year plan to present its collections in new ways, a suite of five renovated painting galleries, originally built in the 1850's, reopened recently. Many paintings in the London museum's collection have also been cleaned and restored.
One gallery is devoted to a bequest by the Victorian collector Constantine Ionides, comprising mainly European Old Masters and 19th-century paintings, including works by Botticelli, Tintoretto, Ingres, Delacroix and Degas. The paintings will be shown with other items from his collection including French sculpture, Oriental ceramics and a piano designed by Edward Burne-Jones, which belonged to Ionides's brother.
Three galleries will focus on the image of landscape in Britain as interpreted by Constable, Turner and their contemporaries. Among the works in these galleries are Turner's ''Lifeboat and Manby Apparatus Going Off to a Stranded Vessel'' and Constable's oil sketches, donated in 1888 by his daughter Isabel, with views of Hampstead Heath in London, Brighton and Suffolk
Yet another gallery, densely hung in the Victorian style, will celebrate British artists like Blake, Landseer and Millais.
