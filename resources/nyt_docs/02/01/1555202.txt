The feature on coincidence theory in the Year in Ideas (Dec. 14) might be understood to suggest that by ''introducing'' the conceptual model described, I originally developed it. In fact, it was conceived by Prof. Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, was published by them in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001 and was the product of their many years of research at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research laboratory. I simply brought it to a broader audience in my public lectures last year.
