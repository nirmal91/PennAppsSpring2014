Haile Gebrselassie's bid to break the 3,000-meter world record at the ninth annual Boston Indoor Games on Saturday never came close.
Gebrselassie, a 30-year-old Ethiopian who is a two-time Olympic champion and a four-time world champion at 10,000 meters, settled for a triumph over his countryman Markos Geneti in the 3,000. Gebrselassie finished in 7 minutes 35.24 seconds, almost 11 seconds off the record. Geneti was second in 7:41.06.
With many fans in the sellout crowd of more than 4,000 at the Reggie Lewis Track and Field Center waving Ethiopian flags, Gebrselassie went through the opening 1,600 in 3:59.60. He could not pick up the pace, however, with no one to push him over the final laps.
''Boston has good fans; I'm sorry if I disappointed them,'' said Gebrselassie, whose first race in the United States was as a junior at the 1992 world cross-country championships at Boston's Franklin Park. He won the gold medal in the 10,000 at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 in his only other start in the United States.
''Maybe I'll come back to Boston some day and run the marathon,'' he said.
The world indoor mark in the 3,000 of 7:24.90 was set by Daniel Komen of Kenya on Feb. 6, 1998, eclipsing the 7:26.15 run by Gebrselassie on Jan. 25, 1998. Komen's outdoor performance of 7:20.67 in Rieti, Italy, in 1996 is the fastest 3,000 meters ever.
Gebrselassie has recorded nine indoor performances faster than 7:35, a mark only three other men have beaten.
Ethiopians dominated the women's 5,000-meter race, too, with Meseret Defar leading three countrywomen over the line in 14:53.14, the fifth-fastest time ever.
Laban Rotich of Kenya edged his countryman Boaz Cheboiywo in the men's mile, 3:56.60 to 3:57.00.
Jon Drummond made his first start since his celebrated disqualification in the men's 100-meter quarterfinals at the world championships in Paris last August, winning the 60-meter sprint in 6.61 seconds.
Stacy Dragila, the women's pole-vault champion at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and a three-time world champion, cleared 15 feet 1 1/2 inches in her first attempt. She was never close in three attempts at 15-5 1/2.
Dragila set the American record of 15-8 1/4 at the Reggie Lewis Center last March at the national championships.
Gail Devers, a two-time Olympic champion in the 100 meters, beat seven rivals out of the blocks and went on to a decisive triumph in the 60-meter hurdles, finishing in 7.86 seconds.
Tonique Williams of the Bahamas fought off Allyson Felix, the heralded 18-year-old University of Southern California freshman, to win the women's 400 meters in 51.98 seconds.
Osmar dos Santos of Brazil broke away from four American rivals early in the men's 600-meter race and went on to win in 1:15.90, the fifth-fastest time ever run and 0.78 of a second off the world mark of 1:15:12, set by Nico Motchebon of Germany in 1999.
