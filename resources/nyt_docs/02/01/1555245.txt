William Christie, word has it, is not a nice man. The critic Peter Conrad blew the whistle on Mr. Christie last month in an article in The Observer (archived at www.guardian.co.uk). Mr. Conrad pronounced Mr. Christie, among other things, insufficiently Christian -- get it? -- for his highhanded treatment of journalists. Imagine: an arrogant conductor!
Mr. Christie, an American expatriate, has galvanized -- not to say, created -- the early-music scene in Paris over the last quarter century. With his superb period ensemble Les Arts Florissants, he has brought the French Baroque, and other Baroques, to vivid life, at home, on tour and in recordings. The group's visits to New York generally rank among the highlights of a season.
Now, celebrating its 25th anniversary, Les Arts Florissants returns. On Thursday and Saturday at Alice Tully Hall, Mr. Christie presents two smallish operas by Marc-Antoine Charpentier in semistaged performances, commemorating -- if further occasion were needed -- the 300th anniversary of Charpentier's death. One work, appropriately, is the group's namesake, ''Les Arts Florissants,'' an ''idyll in music''; the other, ''La Descente d'Orphée aux Enfers.''
The performances are at 8 p.m., and at 6:45 on Saturday Mr. Christie will take part in a preconcert discussion in the Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center. Barring journalistic interventions, he will undoubtedly be on good behavior.
In addition, Mr. Christie and Les Arts Florissants have recently released two typically splendid recordings, of Handel's oratorio ''Theodora'' on Erato and motets by André Campra on Virgin Veritas. Their CD's alone are acentral treasure of the modern early-music movement.
A renewed plea to Mr. Christie: come home (or close to your original home, in Buffalo). Abuse the press if you must. I hereby volunteer for the first flogging if you promise to breathe life into the New York early-music scene.
