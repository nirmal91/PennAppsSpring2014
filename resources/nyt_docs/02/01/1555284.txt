A vacant industrial building in Yonkers, leased in 2000 by Qwest Communications for a Web service center but never used, has been subleased by Diam International, a company that provides merchandising displays, fixtures and services for the retail trade. The 435,000-square-foot single-story structure on Tuckahoe Road was built about 30 years ago for Western Electric, the telephone equipment manufacturer. It was later used by Saks Fifth Avenue as a distribution site.
Citing a telecommunications slowdown, Qwest halted wiring and other work on the building less than a year after it signed a 25-year lease. Now, in a deal worth more than $75 million, Diam International has agreed to occupy the building, which sits on a 19-acre site, for the remainder of the lease, said Ross Schneiderman, executive vice president of NAI Friedland Realty. Diam, which employs 800, is consolidating operations that are now in Queens and the Bronx.
''Diam decided on the Yonkers location so that its labor force could have access to mass transportation to Manhattan and the boroughs,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''Also, there aren't many one-story buildings of this size around.''
It took Qwest a year and a half to find a tenant, said Leonard Zimmerman, a managing director for Grubb &amp; Ellis, which represented Quest. The building is owned by Alfred Weissman Real Estate in Yonkers.
