An article last Sunday about the Classical Recording Foundation, which supports projects of high artistic merit but low commercial priority, gave its age incorrectly and, because of an editing error, misstated the form of its grants. The foundation is three years old, not six. It makes grants to artists, not directly to recording companies.
