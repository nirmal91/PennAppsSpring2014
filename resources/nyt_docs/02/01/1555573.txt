Property owners along a 2.5-mile strip of Central Avenue have overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to establish a Business Improvement District. BID's, as they are known, are initiated by landowners, merchants or a development corporation. They are unions of business owners that pay for their projects via a voluntary tax, and are approved by the municipal legislature. A majority vote of property owners would have been required to take the proposal before the Yonkers City Council.
But instead, the owners voted 88 to 15 against the planned district, which was to stretch from Tuckahoe Road to the Greenburgh line. Ted Weinberg, developer of the new Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond complex in Yonkers and co-chairman of the Business Improvement Committee, said that the goal was to improve signage, install plantings in the medians and work to smooth traffic flow. Owners objected, in part, to the new tax they would have paid to create the BID. ''Had I known that so many people would have objected to it in the beginning, I never would have pursued it,'' he said.
Mr. Weinberg added he that he views the defeat as a lost opportunity to help Central Avenue compete with other retail venues. ''White Plains is adding a million square feet of retail, Port Chester added half a million with more online, Sanford Boulevard in Mount Vernon added half a million and what's going to happen if they add space at the Cross County Center? I think they're being pennywise and pound foolish.''
