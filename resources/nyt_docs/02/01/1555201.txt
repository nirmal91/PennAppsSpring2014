Puzzle fans who enjoyed your Dec. 28 challenge on amusingly ambiguous headlines may have found them somewhat familiar if they also happen to be readers of The Columbia Journalism Review, which for more than 40 years has been publishing such gems on the inside back cover of every issue under the rubric ''The Lower case.'' To cite just two: ''Farmer Bill Dies in House'' (your 23-across), from The Atlanta Constitution of April 13, 1978, and ''Red Tape Holds Up Bridge'' (your 53-across), adapted from a headline that ran in The Milford, Conn., Citizen of July 12, 1982, and that later served as the title of a 1987 paperback ''Lower case'' collection. As C.J.R. readers well know, you can't make this stuff up!
