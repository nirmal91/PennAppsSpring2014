THE stock market is up and the economy is improving, so this seems the perfect time to remind people of all the things that can go wrong in business. That might keep exuberance -- irrational or otherwise -- from getting out of hand.
This week, the Portfolio unit of the Penguin Group is releasing ''The Dumbest Moments in Business History,'' compiled by the same team of editors who create an annual feature on this subject for Business 2.0 magazine.
When your canvas is all of recorded history, you have a huge number of blunders from which to choose. They range from the not very well thought out -- the first roller skates, invented in the mid-18th century, didn't have brakes -- to the insipid. Did the world really need the XFL, the football league started by NBC and the World Wrestling Federation?
While the usual suspects, like New Coke and the Edsel, are represented, the book also describes many efforts that might otherwise have been forgotten.
Remember the baby food company that introduced 100 percent apple juice that didn't contain a drop of juice? How about ''his and hers'' cars? (The ''hers'' had a pink theme.) Or what about the introduction of premoistened toilet paper? The list goes on.
Josh Quittner, Business 2.0's editor, appears to have it all in perspective. Mr. Quittner writes in the introduction: ''This volume is a collection of cautionary tales from which we can all learn valuable lessons about how not to conduct business. So I'm pretty sure you can expense it.''
