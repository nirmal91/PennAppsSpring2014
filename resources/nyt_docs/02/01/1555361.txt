Fresh from his duties as co-chairman of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Carlos Ghosn, the chief of Nissan, picked up a director's post at I.B.M. last week.
But isn't Mr. Ghosn based in Tokyo? How can he attend all those board meetings in Armonk, N.Y.? Actually, Mr. Ghosn's board seat is his second at an American corporation. He also serves on the board of Alcoa.
Even before taking the new I.B.M. job, Mr. Ghosn was planning to spend more time in North America, which has become a key driver in Nissan's operations. And next year, Mr. Ghosn is planning to move to Paris, where he will serve as chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, the French automaker that took management control of Nissan in 1999.
Mr. Ghosn says he thinks that his absence may do Nissan employees some good. ''Maybe they will be even more productive without me there'' to look over their shoulders, he joked in an interview last month.
