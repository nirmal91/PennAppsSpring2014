To the Sports Editor:
Murray Chass's Jan. 20 column (''Mets Seem to Pay Price No Matter Their Choice'') is a classic example of waffling on Mets choices. Chass cites critics' cases, but he makes lots of excuses for the the Mets' inept decisions.
He concludes that Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner, can't spend with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. He writes that the Mets have been ''stung badly'' by an injured player (Mo Vaughn); referring to Vladimir Guerrero, Chass asks, ''can they really be blamed for being gun-shy?''
Yes, they can and should be blamed. Keeping up with Steinbrenner is not the issue. Being competitive with National League teams and keeping Mets fans should be what it's all about. The single most important thing Mets management could have done would be to sign Guerrero. It would have excited Mets fans. Instead, Chass says the Mets are aiming to lower their payroll.
Is it any wonder fans are canceling season tickets?
