To the Editor:
Re: ''What's the Problem, Officer?'': There is not enough emphasis is placed on speeding and other traffic problems in Westchester, and politicians and residents must become more aware of this and other related problems.
In an area called Cedar Knolls, which is just north of another area called Longvale (both of these communities abut the northbound side of the Sprain Parkway), we have been complaining for more than 15 years about the many speeders causing an unbelievable amount of noise. The problem is caused in part because of two factors: When the Sprain Parkway was built there was never a plan for a turn-around area when the state troopers are heading south toward the Bronx River Parkway. It is easier for them to turn around at Tuckahoe Road, leaving a one-mile stretch on both sides of the parkway to be used as a drag strip, especially for motorcycles. There is only one trooper patrolling the parkway, making it virtually impossible to get caught speeding. If there is an accident or another problem, there will be more patrol cars.
The state even did a sound survey in this area of the parkway and it showed a definite need for a sound barrier. That won't stop the speeders but it might help us get a decent night's sleep once in a while.
