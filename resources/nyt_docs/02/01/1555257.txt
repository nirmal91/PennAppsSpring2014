To the Editor: My husband and I were delighted to see your references in ''T-Shirt Casual to White-glove Chic'' (Jan. 11) to Captain Charlie's Reef Grill in Juno Beach, Fla. We had eaten there with friends two nights earlier for the first time. We agreed with Bryan Miller's evaluation of the excellent food and service.
As older people we usually check for lower-priced ''sunset'' dinners. At Captain Charlie's there is a terrific $21.95-for-two price with a long list of entrees, available from 5 to 6 p.m.
