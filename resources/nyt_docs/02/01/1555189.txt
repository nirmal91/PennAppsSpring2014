With respect to gaining a competitive edge, psychological methods and techniques can help athletes develop mental and emotional aspects of their game. Goal-setting, visualization, emotional centering and focusing have proved successful in helping athletes develop balanced perspectives in sport and life, keeping their minds in the moment as they compete and helping them to remain composed under pressure. Such methods are easy to teach; they are legal, ethical, readily adaptable for all sports -- and they are cheap.
