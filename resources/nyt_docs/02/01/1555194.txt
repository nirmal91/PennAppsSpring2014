Two pit bulls owned by a neighbor attacked our son, who had just turned 7, and my wife, when she went to his rescue, in our own driveway a year ago. Our son bled from deep puncture wounds. My wife was bitten on the wrist. They are O.K. now.
I take it that your reaction to all of this, after some expression of sympathy for our troubles, would be that these pit bulls must have been transformed by an owner somewhere along the way and that they're not natural-born killers.
You know what? I kind of like the idea of (sudden intake of breath) banning the breed.
