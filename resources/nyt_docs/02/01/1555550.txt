President Bush has signed into law a measure that will keep planes over 100,000 pounds like the Boeing 737 business jet from landing at Teterboro Airport, Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from Bergen County, said last week. The Federal Aviation Agency had proposed lifting a 37-year old ban on overweight planes at Teterboro, a move that prompted concern and anger in the densely populated towns around the airport. Legislation drafted by Mr. Rothman to keep the ban became part of the annual appropriations bill in Congress. That passed the House in December and passed the Senate last month, with the support of New Jersey's Democratic senators, Jon Corzine and Frank Lautenberg. The measure will have to be renewed next year, but Mr. Rothman was confident a precedent had been set. ''We don't want your jumbo jets in our backyards and we never will,'' he said in a statement. He was also instrumental in getting a measure passed recently permanently banning scheduled charter service at the airport.
