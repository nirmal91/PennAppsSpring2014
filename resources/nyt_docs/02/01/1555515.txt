To the Editor:
Re ''Education Is No Protection,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 26):
The subject of outsourcing is more complex, and the real costs are higher, than the numbers alone suggest. Any corporate executive weighing offshore outsourcing must consider the political, economic and social environments.
Not very long ago, it was feared that India and Pakistan, among the potential providers of labor, would fire nuclear weapons at each other. Russia remains plagued by internal terrorism, political and business corruption, and badly enforced or inadequate laws. China, perhaps more stable but also more repressive, fails to respect intellectual property rights.
So the executive must ask: If this issue were about capital other than labor, would I want to invest in these countries?
Of course, this discussion assumes that he or she is willing to outsource jobs in the first place -- which means giving up the advantages of an in-house staff of trained, known and accountable information professionals, who, once dispersed, would take years to replace.
