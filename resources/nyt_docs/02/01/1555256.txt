To the Editor: Reading ''What's Doing in Melbourne'' (Jan. 11) brought back great memories of our trip there two years ago.
We would suggest that one other wonderful way to enjoy and learn about the city and its citizens is to take the purple City Circle tram that circles the city (and is free) and just see the sights. Be sure to visit Young &amp; Jackson's bar. One of the oldest bars in Melbourne with an amazing inventory of beers, it is easily visible from the Flinders Street tram stop.
