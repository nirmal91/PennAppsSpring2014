To the Editor:
Regarding: ''When Playing Space Vies With a Memorial'' (In the Schools column, Jan. 18): One realizes that teenagers in our affluent culture are far removed from the sufferings of the war in Iraq, but the current success of Tom Brokaw's book ''The Greatest Generation'' along with the ''Saving Private Ryan'' movie bring the value of freedom to our local families for whom the Richard M. Kemper Memorial Park is meaningful.
In the war in Iraq, we have many dead and many wounded, in hospitals and in rehabilitation. The casualties from the war may be teenagers from this area.
Growing up in Mamaroneck in the 1940's, a neighbor was Rabbi Nathan Bleechman whose son Solomon died in the bloody South Pacific struggle while serving as a combat correspondent with the Marine Corps. He was buried at sea, leaving his only memorial the high school park where he attended school. When his two sisters visit the village, this monument with its trees is always a source of comfort and closure to ease their loss.
The Kemper family has said it hopes that the Mamaroneck School Board can live up to the spirit and provisions of the deed given when the park was donated. I think there is adequate space at Harbor Island Park for scheduling soccer games.
To those who honor the memory of these fallen heroes, this memorial park adjacent to the high school has all the reverence and sacredness of Arlington National Cemetery or the Vietnam Memorial Wall.
