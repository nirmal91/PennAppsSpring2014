To the Editor:
''Do Funds Really Need to Find New Directors?'' (Market Insight, Jan. 25) discussed how mutual funds might be required to add independent directors.
But a crucial issue is the quality of the independent directors. Those who are simply friends or acquaintances of executives, or are high-profile individuals with little or no familiarity with the complexities of fund operations and regulatory issues, can hardly be counted on to be effective watchdogs on behalf of shareholders. What's needed are new directors who are both independent and have a direct or indirect working knowledge of mutual fund operations so that shareholder interests will be properly served. No amount of hired advisers can replace this consideration.
