To the Editor:
In ''Education Is No Protection'' (column, Jan. 26), Bob Herbert complains about the flow of jobs abroad. But this outsourcing will help the middle class in other countries. An engaged middle class will then help democracy there and make the world safer.
How many lives will be saved through reduced conflict?
Job outsourcing also makes American companies more efficient. This frees up money for investment in more advanced, riskier projects. The result is better, more innovative products.
Besides, education is about acquiring marketable skills. We must all adapt to change.
