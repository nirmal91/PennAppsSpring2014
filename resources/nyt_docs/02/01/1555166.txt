To the Editor:
The review of ''The Beecher Sisters,'' by Barbara A. White, and ''The Passionate Beechers,'' by Samuel A. Schreiner Jr. (Jan. 11), omits any mention of one of the Beecher family's social causes: anti-Catholicism. Lyman Beecher wrote a book, ''A Plea for the West'' (1835), that claimed the pope intended to conquer the Mississippi Valley; his son Edward Beecher wrote ''The Papal Conspiracy Exposed'' (1855) and attacked the church in sermons that were likened to brimstone.
