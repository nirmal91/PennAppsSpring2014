To the Editor:
The article about the conductor Anne Manson [''Another Assault on the Male Conducting Bastion'' by Matthew Gurewitsch, Jan. 25] put me in mind of the several female conductors under whom we played in the Philadelphia Orchestra during my 36 years there (playing oboe and English horn).
All were highly competent, but none, in the general opinion of the players, at the level of Ormandy, Klemperer, Leinsdorf, etc. With one exception: Thea Musgrave. During her brief stay with us in Philadelphia, conducting her own composition, Ms. Musgrave showed herself to be on a par with such conductors as the above-mentioned gentlemen.
