Emily Nussbaum's article (Jan. 11) reminded me of the time I spent online last year before my now-9-month-old daughter was born. Pregnancy can be likened to the adolescent angst Nussbaum describes in the bloggers she interviewed: new, strange things are happening to your body; you are entering a world with new pressures, responsibilities and expectations, all the while questioning your own ability to handle it all successfully.
If blogging -- and any online communication -- serve to calm our fears and make us feel that we are less alone, well, then, long live blogging.
