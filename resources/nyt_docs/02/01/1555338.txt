Despite continuing good news on earnings, the stock market fell last week after a surprise announcement from the Federal Reserve.
On Wednesday, after a two-day meeting on interest rates, Fed policy makers said they would leave their benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent. But they withdrew a statement inserted after their August meeting that said the central bank would be able to keep this rate low ''for a considerable period.''
Although it is generally expected that the Fed will begin to raise interest rates over the next year, this signal was unexpected and cast a pall over both the stock and bond markets.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, led by Winn-Dixie Stores, fell 10.42 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,131.13. The fall broke a string of nine positive weeks for the index. Led lower by Veritas Software, the Nasdaq composite dropped 57.72 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,066.15. The Dow Jones industrial average, led by General Motors, dropped 80.22 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,488.07. In the bond market, the Fed's policy change helped send prices lower and yields higher. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.14 percent, from 4.07 percent a week earlier.
