State troopers found 660 pounds of cocaine hidden in a truck amid toys bound for Wal-Mart stores in North Carolina, the authorities said. The truck, which had been stopped for speeding near Forrest City, was not owned by Wal-Mart, and the authorities were uncertain where its trip began or where the drugs, which they valued at $30 million, were put aboard. The driver and the passenger were arrested, and bond for each was set at $2 million.
