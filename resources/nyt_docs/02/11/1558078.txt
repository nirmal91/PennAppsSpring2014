Foote Cone &amp; Belding is hiring a senior executive from BBDO Worldwide as both agencies promote other managers.
Lynne F. Seid, executive vice president and chief client officer since fall 2001 at the flagship New York office of BBDO, part of the Omnicom Group, is joining Foote Cone as president of the New York office. Ms. Seid joined BBDO New York in March 2000 from the New York office of the Wolf Group.
She assumes duties from Jeff Tarakajian, president and chief executive at Foote Cone New York, who in May gave up the posts to focus on business development and oversee large accounts like Diet Coke. Chris Becker, 40, chief creative officer at Foote Cone New York, will serve as chairman, a new post.
A spokesman at BBDO New York, Roy Elvove, said the agency would distribute Ms. Seid's responsibilities among other executives.
But BBDO New York is filling another post, president and chief executive, hiring John Osborn, executive vice president and director for integrated marketing at BBDO North America. Mr. Osborn, 37, who has worked at BBDO almost continuously since 1991 -- with a brief stint at Nike as a divisional advertising manager -- will succeed Bill Katz, who said last month that he would step down; a departure date for Mr. Katz is to be determined.
Also at Foote Cone, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, two executives responsible for international operations are being promoted as Harry Reid retires as president of Foote Cone &amp; Belding International.
One, Scott Hollingsworth, 50, president and chief executive for Europe, based in London, will add oversight for Latin America and the Middle East. And the other, Ben Barnes, 50, president and chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region, based in Hong Kong, will also work on African operations. Both will report to Brendan Ryan, chief executive at Foote Cone in New York. Mr. Reid, 59, is retiring after nine years leading international operations.
