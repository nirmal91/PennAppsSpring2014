A three-judge federal panel in Atlanta found the maps for state legislative districts unconstitutional because they violated the principle of one person one vote by an unacceptable margin for no legitimate reason. The suit had been filed by Republicans. The maps, drawn when the Legislature was controlled by Democrats, were used in the 2002 elections. The panel gave the state until March 1 to draw acceptable new maps, or the court may draw them itself. The 2002 elections produced a Republican governor and led to a Republican-controlled Senate, but Democrats still control the House.
