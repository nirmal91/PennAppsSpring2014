A livery cab driver was shot and seriously wounded in the Bronx yesterday, the police said. The driver, 55, was shot once in the neck by a passenger in his car in the vicinity of West 188th Street in University Heights, a Police Department spokeswoman said. The bullet came out of his cheek or jaw, and the injury appeared not to be life-threatening, the spokeswoman said. The driver, whom the police did not identify, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in serious but stable condition. The spokeswoman said that the attacker, a man in his 20's, ran from the cab with $200 he had taken from the driver.
