Correction:  February 16, 2004, Monday  A sports picture caption on Wednesday with an article about the use of technology in baseball misidentified the Mets player whose pitching motion was being analyzed. He was Scott Kazmir, not Pat Strange. The article misspelled the given name of another Mets pitcher scheduled for camera analysis. He was Braden Looper, not Brandon.
