To the Editor:
Re ''Bush on Bush, Take 2'' (column, Feb. 10):
David Brooks, speaking for President Bush, writes that ''some liberals have trouble grasping evil, and always think that if we could take care of the handguns or the cruise missiles or the W.M.D., our problems would be ameliorated.''
Almost 30,000 Americans were killed by firearms in 2001. If that's not evil, I don't know what is.
