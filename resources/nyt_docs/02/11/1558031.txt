To the Editor:
Re ''With Costs Rising, Treating Back Pain Often Seems Futile'' (front page, Feb. 9):
Back pain can be more crippling, and back surgery more of a boon, than is apparent from your article about the Duke University study.
My back pain started in December 1997. First I couldn't sit, then I couldn't stand, then I couldn't walk, despite prescription painkillers. In bed, pain woke me at night.
In early May 1998 we drove to Syracuse to see a surgeon; my husband had to scrounge a hospital gurney because I couldn't hobble the short distance to the doctor's office, even with crutches. I had surgery the next day and have been free of pain since.
Surgery may not help everyone, but it gave me my life back.
I wonder whether those who advocate ''teaching people to live with pain'' know what they are asking.
I had four children by natural childbirth and have, I think, a reasonable tolerance for pain, but unceasing pain for weeks and months on end is hard to imagine if you haven't experienced it.
