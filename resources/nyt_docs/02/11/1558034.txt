To the Editor:
Regarding your Feb. 9 front-page article about the rising costs of treating back pain:
What has changed about back pain is not only patient expectations. It is the way that doctors are educated: they are taught to ''find the cure'' and ''ease the pain.''
At osteopathic medical schools, spinal manipulative therapies are taught, and traditional modalities like pain management and surgical correction, a therapeutic approach of last resort, are not excluded as treatment options.
At least one large prospective research study has shown the benefits of osteopathic manipulation to be equivalent to analgesic administration alone. Let's see research dollars go into more such studies rather than better, and costlier, diagnostic imaging technologies.
