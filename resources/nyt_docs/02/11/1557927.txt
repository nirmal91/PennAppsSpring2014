The alumni of Lespinasse, the four-star restaurant in the St. Regis that closed last year, continue to enrich the New York dining scene. OCÉO , 224 West 49th Street in the Time Hotel, is the work of three of them: JEAN-PHILIPPE LELOUP  (below), who was the manager; PHILIPP  POSCH , the food and beverage manager for the hotel; and SHANE McBRIDE , who was the chef de cuisine. Océo's dining room, with 90 seats, has an earthy color scheme and an inviting bar. There is a second-floor lounge, LA GAZELLE . Mr. McBride offers stylish dishes like ahi tuna sashimi with caramelized grapefruit and braised lamb shoulder under a chickpea fritter.
The pub food by APRIL BLOOMFIELD  at THE SPOTTED PIG , just opened at 314 West 11th Street, has a rich Italian accent, thanks to her experience at the River Cafe in London (where the river should be the Arno, not the Thames) and to the input of MARIO BATALI . Look for panzotti with pumpkin, goat cheese and marjoram; mozzarella with roasted radicchio and marinated olives; and char-grilled monkfish with salsa verde.
TURGUT BALIKCI  owns Pasha, Bella Luna and Il Fiore on the Upper West Side and keeps going. His latest restaurant is BELLO SGUARDO , 410 Amsterdam Avenue (80th Street), which specializes in meze and tapas.
KALUSTYAN , the spice and rice emporium at Lexington Avenue and 29th Street, has opened KALUSTYAN'S MASALA CAFE , 115 Lexington Avenue (28th Street). And last week, its owners, Sayedul Alam and Aziz Osmani, opened a Brooklyn branch of CURRY LEAF , their restaurant at 99 Lexington Avenue (28th Street). The new place, near Borough Hall, is at 151 Remsen Street near Clinton Street.
SALÓN MÉXICO  on East 26th Street has closed. ALAN MIGUEL KAPLAN , the chef and owner, said the building had been sold. He is looking for a new location.
