To the Editor:
You quote Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, as saying in response to a remark by Mel Gibson about the Holocaust, ''He doesn't begin to understand the difference between dying in a famine and people being cremated solely for what they are'' (''Gibson to Delete a Scene in 'Passion,' '' Arts pages, Feb. 4).
Mr. Gibson had said in an interview: ''The Second World War killed tens of millions of people. Some of them were Jews in concentration camps. . . . In the Ukraine several million starved to death between 1932 and 1933.''
Comments like Mr. Foxman's undermine the gravity of the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people. Between 7 million and 10 million Ukrainians were systematically starved to death in 1932-33 simply because of who they were and because of their resistance to Soviet dominance.
To play down and deny that shows a blatant disregard and insensitivity to a nation that suffered under an oppressive regime.
Mr. Foxman should realize that all genocides should be reviled rather than categorized.
