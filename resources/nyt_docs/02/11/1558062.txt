An article in Business Day on Saturday about efforts by US Airways to make its case for more wage and benefit cuts paraphrased incorrectly from remarks by David N. Siegel, its chief executive, in a conference call with analysts about the entry of Southwest Airlines into Philadelphia, a US Airways hub. He said Southwest's entry was aimed as much at low-fare carriers as it was at US Airways -- not that Southwest posed a bigger threat to the low-fare airlines.
