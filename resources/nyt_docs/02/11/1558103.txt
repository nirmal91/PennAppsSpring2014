The Mars rover Spirit set a record for driving on Mars, NASA managers announced in Pasadena, Calif. The journey covered 70 feet on Monday, they said; the previous single-day mark was 23 feet, set by the Sojourner rover on NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997. The Spirit is en route to a depression nicknamed Bonneville Crater, 820 feet to the northeast of its landing site. As flight controllers gain experience with the Spirit and its twin, the Opportunity, on the other side of Mars, they hope that the rovers will be able to travel 130 feet a day or even farther.
