The United Negro College Fund has announced that Michael L. Lomax, left, 56, the president of Dillard University in New Orleans, will become chief executive in June. He will succeed William H. Gray, 63, the former Pennsylvania congressman who led the fund for 13 years, raising $2.3 billion for its activities. The fund raises about $150 million a year to support 39 historically black colleges and universities around the nation, with about 60,000 students. It also gives scholarships to another 5,000 students at other colleges or universities.
