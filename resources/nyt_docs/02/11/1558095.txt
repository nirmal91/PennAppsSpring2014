A gang of teenagers in St. Petersburg attacked a family from Tajikistan, stabbing a 9-year-old girl to death and badly injuring her father and her 7-year-old cousin, a police spokesman said. The attackers, reportedly drunken skinheads, escaped. Violence by neo-Nazi and other xenophobic gangs is common in St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, but the brutality of the act prompted unusually strong denunciations by the city's leaders.
