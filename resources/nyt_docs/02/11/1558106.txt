The State Senate approved a bill yesterday that would raise the classification of endangering the welfare of a child to a felony from a misdemeanor. The State Assembly has yet to introduce the bill. The bill, known as Laura Mae's Law, is named after an infant who died at an overcrowded, unlicensed day-care center in Rensselaer County. The center's operator, Mary Beth Anslow, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment, was sentenced to one year in prison, and was released after three months. Her release was overturned this week. Under the bill, the crime would be punishable by up to four years in prison.
