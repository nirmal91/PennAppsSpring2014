To the Editor:
In ''Bush on Bush, Take 2'' (column, Feb. 10), David Brooks says, ''Like most of us, President Bush doesn't have the facility for perfectly expressing his situation in conversation.''
George W. Bush is not like most of us. He is the president of the United States.
Being able to express himself about foreign and domestic policy as well as being able to answer questions about his administration is an important part of the job.
If he can't express himself, he has no business being the president.
