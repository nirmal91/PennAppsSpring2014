Many insurers are refusing to write homeowner policies in New Jersey's poorest cities, New Jersey Citizen Action, a consumer advocacy group, found in a survey of first-time homebuyers and insurance agents. The group's report, released yesterday, recommends legislation that would require insurance companies to disclose where their policies are issued. The survey questioned agents in Trenton, Newark, Asbury Park and Camden. Magdalena Padilla, the president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, a trade organization, said the report covered only a fraction of policies written in New Jersey.
