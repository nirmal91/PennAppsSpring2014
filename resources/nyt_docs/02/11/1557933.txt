To the Editor:
Re ''The Intelligence Commission'' (editorial, Feb. 7):
It is a shame that President Bush's panel was given no explicit mandate to examine whether the administration distorted pre-invasion intelligence.
And judging from Senator John McCain's assertion -- before a single document has been examined or a syllable of testimony has been heard -- that ''the president of the United States, I believe, would not manipulate any kind of information for political gain or otherwise,'' it seems unlikely that the commission will take up this vital question on its own.
