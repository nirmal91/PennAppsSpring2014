There are better times to visit a winery than when the iron fist of winter has shut down the landscape. But McLaughlin Vineyards in Sandy Hook, Conn., is luring weekend visitors with a program called Wine, Food and Eagles, which combines a trip to the Bald Eagle Observatory in nearby Southbury, a tasting at the winery and lunch at Compass, a restaurant in Newtown, about 15 minutes away.
On my visit one of the bald eagles I saw was a stately specimen that posed endlessly on a branch. The observatory, a large wooden shed equipped with telescopes, is on the property of Connecticut Light and Power. Back in the winery's tasting room, visitors could warm up with cocoa and mulled cider in addition to McLaughlin's valiant little wines, the best of which were chardonnay, merlot and the semi-sweet Coyote, made from Aurora grapes.
The program, including a four-course lunch, is $50 a person, plus tax and tip at the restaurant. It runs through the end of the month. It is sold out for Saturday, but reservations are available for Sunday and for the two following weekends: (203) 426-1533.
