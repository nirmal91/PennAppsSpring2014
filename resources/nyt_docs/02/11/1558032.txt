To the Editor:
The conclusion that back pain therapies may be useless (front page, Feb. 9) comes as no surprise to the many thousands of patients of Dr. John E. Sarno of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine in New York. He has demonstrated that virtually all back pain is the result of a stress-related syndrome and can be effectively eliminated as soon as patients unlearn a lifetime of hype about their supposedly vulnerable vertebrae.
Over several decades, Dr. Sarno has shown how worthless spinal surgery is -- in fact, it is but a small part of a vast back industry, in which orthopedists, physical therapists and chiropractors, not to mention makers of mattresses, shoes and exercise equipment, enrich themselves without providing any lasting benefit to back pain sufferers.
