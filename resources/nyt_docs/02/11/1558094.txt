President Alejandro Toledo's precarious political position slipped as the leading opposition party said it would not take part in a new cabinet. Mr. Toledo is facing a political crisis that has led to the resignations of four ministers, and his new prime minister, Carlos Ferrero, said the administration would seek the participation of opposition parties in a cabinet intended to appease foes who accuse it of corruption. But the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance said it would not enter the negotiations. The party's general secretary said Mr. Toledo's government had ''not distanced itself from corruption.''
