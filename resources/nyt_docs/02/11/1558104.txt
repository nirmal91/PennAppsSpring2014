About one in four pay telephones in the New York City subway and commuter rail system do not work properly, according to a survey released yesterday by the Straphangers Campaign, a passenger advocacy group. Volunteers and staff members of the group spent four months surveying 100 stations picked at random from the 712 stations in the system. About 27 percent of subway pay phones surveyed did not work, compared with 17 percent of Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad pay phones, the survey said. The most common problems were no dial tone on the phone (38 percent); failure to return a coin (24 percent); coin not registering (13 percent); coin slot blocked (11 percent); inability to connect a call (10 percent); and flawed handset (5 percent). A Verizon spokesman, Daniel Diaz Zapata, said that the problems stemmed from vandalism and the difficulty of tracking the phones' condition. He urged riders to dial *55 from a working phone to report a problem.
