A twin-engine Iranian passenger plane crashed while approaching the airport at Sharjah, killing 43 of the 46 people on board, officials said. Most of the dead were immigrant workers. Three survivors were hospitalized, two in critical condition. There were conflicting reports whether the plane, a Dutch-built Fokker-50 operated by Kish Air, had signaled that it was in trouble, though witnesses said it began wobbling as it descended. Officials ruled out terrorism as a possible cause.
