To the Editor:
The reason the war on terror no longer gets the respect that it deserves is that the Bush administration's domestic policies are utterly inconsistent with the commitment and gravitas that David Brooks tries to ascribe to the administration's foreign policy (''Bush on Bush, Take 2,'' column, Feb. 10).
A president who truly believed that 9/11 was a defining moment would ask Americans to do more than shop.
He would throw over his energy pals and end America's dependence on Middle East oil.
He would tell his billionaire friends that now is not the time for a tax cut.
He would seek bipartisan consensus.
Instead, the events of 9/11 have simply served as an excuse for this president and his associates to do what they intended to do anyway: invade Iraq, dump the United Nations, reward Halliburton.
That's why the president's remarks needed a rewrite; the commitment that Mr. Brooks was looking for doesn't really exist.
