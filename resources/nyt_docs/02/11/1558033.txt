To the Editor:
''With Costs Rising, Treating Back Pain Often Seems Futile'' (front page, Feb. 9) describes the elusive nature of understanding back pain.
Since the symptoms are not visible to a trained eye, it is difficult at best to diagnose the sources of back pain.
As a yoga teacher, I work with students with chronic back pain, and more often than not, the source is clear as day: bad posture.
Americans spend hours slumped behind the wheel and computer and stand with their feet turned out, pinching the sacrum; and of course, many have an extra load to carry, contributing to the weakening of the back muscles.
While pain management is an excellent idea (yoga is great for this), so is learning to stand and sit up straight!
