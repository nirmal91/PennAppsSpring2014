To the Editor:
Both your Feb. 9 editorial ''Soul Gazing'' (some editions) and William Safire's Feb. 9 column, ''Putin's 'Creeping Coup,' '' rightly note the changes in Russia's domestic and foreign policies -- from the manipulation of the recent elections to the announcement that Russia may abrogate the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, portending a less pro-Western stance on any number of other foreign policy issues.
Nonetheless, some of the blame for these changes rests squarely with the Bush administration. President Vladimir V. Putin took a risk -- over the objections of many of his advisers -- when immediately after 9/11 he joined in the fight against terrorism by allowing the deployment of American troops in Central Asia.
And what did Russia get in return? The United States repaid Mr. Putin by abrogating the Antiballistic Missile treaty and by pushing NATO expansion to the Baltic states. In this context, the abrupt shift from being ''soul mates'' to harsh critics ill serves our long-range foreign policy goals.
