Iowa's two-year-old law banning sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or child care center was found unconstitutional by a federal judge. The judge, Robert W. Pratt of Federal District Court, said that the law infringed on offenders' due process rights and that it was unlawfully retroactive. The law, enacted in 2002, was intended to keep offenders away from children, but critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said it effectively banished offenders from 30 percent of the towns in the state.
