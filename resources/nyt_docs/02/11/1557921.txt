Bartenders' imaginations tend to go into overdrive for Valentine's Day. At City Hall, 131 Duane Street (Church Street), Gordon Levy, the bar manager, and Seth Gurka, the manager, have concocted a tall yellow cocktail called First Kiss. It is made with Laurent-Perrier Champagne, passion fruit pur√©e and vanilla. It will be free for couples celebrating their first Valentine's Day together. After Saturday, it is $10, and so is the restaurant's pale pink refresher, a mojito made with ruby red grapefruit juice.
