To the Editor:
Re ''Bush on Bush, Take 2'' (column, Feb. 10):
As a liberal, I disagree with President Bush on virtually every issue, except the one that David Brooks points out.
Mr. Bush, unlike many, understands the nature of our current struggle.
Ours is an existential, not a political, battle, and one need not share the president's religious beliefs to understand that we are facing evil.
The proof is the simple fact that we have no one with whom we can negotiate, or even surrender to, yet we have some 3,000 dead, that horrible hole in the skyline and those sad memorials in virtually every town in our region.
Saddam Hussein is evil and meant us harm; that he did not have weapons of mass destruction anymore or that he is not Osama bin Laden does not give him a pass.
The primary job of this president and the next, liberal or conservative, is to confront this malevolence around the world.
In destroying this evil, we protect ourselves, and we can also bring freedom to the millions who live under brutal dictatorships.
This is a good thing even if it is President Bush who is doing it.
