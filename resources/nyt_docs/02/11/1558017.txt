The Museum of the City of New York, the New York City Opera, the New-York Historical Society and the Signature Theater Company are among 15 cultural organizations that are the top contenders to inhabit a performing arts center at ground zero, or help create an interpretive museum there that will describe the attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001.
The short list of finalists was announced yesterday by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts.
Other finalists include the Joyce Theater Foundation, the New York Hall of Science, the New York State Museum, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and the 92nd Street Y.
The institutions selected ''will be asked to participate in future meetings that will determine which will be part of a world-class cultural nucleus on the site,'' said Kevin M. Rampe, the development corporation president.
The winners are expected to be announced in late March or early April, he said.
The development corporation also released a list of 113 cultural institutions that had submitted proposals or letters of interest but had not been selected, including El Museo del Barrio, the Jean Cocteau Repertory, the Skyscraper Museum and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
Reactions from institutions varied. ''We are pleased that we can look forward to participating in this important opportunity,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New-York Historical Society. ''We have many objects that would help to explain why the greatest city in the world was attacked.''
Several rejected institutions declined to comment.
However, Carol Willis, director and founder of the Skyscraper Museum, said, ''We could help to tell the story of the history of the site, and the World Trade Center, in a significant way, and would be happy to work with them if they requested our expertise.''
