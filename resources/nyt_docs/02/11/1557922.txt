Fresh shrimp from Maine, in season until early March, are delicious cooked ever so briefly in water as salty as the sea, then peeled and eaten for a feast of sweet little mouthfuls. They are also good to smoke lightly. Line a wok and its cover with foil, place two tablespoons each of brown sugar, white rice and black tea leaves in the bottom, cover the wok and place it over high heat. In about five minutes, fragrant smoke should start to rise. Place the raw shrimp in their shells on a rack in the wok, cover again and smoke about 10 minutes, then serve the shrimp alone with a dipping sauce. The shrimp are often sold with their heads on, $5.99 to $7.99 a pound at stores like Wild Edibles, above.
