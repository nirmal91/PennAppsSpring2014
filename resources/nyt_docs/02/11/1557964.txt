Muhammad Ismail Agha, 15, one of three young Afghans released 10 days ago from imprisonment at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has returned home, no worse for wear but bitter at what he went through.
In an interview in his hometown of Nawzad on Saturday, he said he was looking for work when he was arrested by Afghan militia soldiers and handed over to American troops in 2002. They imprisoned him for 14 months as a terrorist suspect, first at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul and then for a year in Guantánamo.
''I got something good from them -- I can read and write,'' he said. He also learned English and studied the Koran in his own language, Pashto, he said. But he is bitter at being locked up for so long when he was guilty of nothing but looking for a job. His captors took away 14 months of his life, and kept him from earning money all that time, he said.
His family suffered not only extra hardship but also anxiety at not knowing what had happened to him. It was not until 10 months after his disappearance that he was able to send a letter.
''We were thinking maybe he went somewhere to work,'' said his older cousin, Sayed Muhammad Daoud Agha. ''But we were wondering whether he was dead or alive.''
''His father borrowed a lot of money from people and was looking for him for a long time,'' he added. ''He should get compensation from the Americans, because he was innocent and kept in prison all this time.''
Muhammad Agha said he never imagined his ordeal would be so prolonged. ''When they first captured me I was thinking they would not imprison me for long because I was innocent,'' he said. ''And then when they took me to Cuba I was also thinking the same, that they would release me soon. I was missing my family.''
He also insisted that he held no grievance against the Americans. ''They were good people, and they were giving me some lessons,'' he said. ''I am angry with the Afghans who handed me over to the Americans. The Americans did not know what was happening.''
