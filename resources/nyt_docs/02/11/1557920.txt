Bill Clinton, more than any other recent President, was known for his hearty appetite, so as Presidents' Day approaches, a look at ''The Clinton Presidential Center Cookbook'' is called for. Edited by Shannon Butler and Nealon DeVore and costing $24.95, the book raises funds for the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation, which supports the center and library to be built in Little Rock, Ark. In the book are 250 recipes, heavily weighted toward Southern specialties like grits, jambalaya and pecan pie. They came from friends, celebrities, relatives and officials in the Clinton administration, including James Carville, Mary Steenburgen, Betty Currie, Leon Panetta and Al and Tipper Gore. Some are as simple as Whoopi Goldberg's Malibu Beach Buffet, which consists of buying takeout salads, but others are more elaborate, like Jayni and Chevy Chase's cauliflower soup with croutons. And, of course, there is the recipe for Hillary Rodham Clinton's chocolate chip cookies.
