Mexico's trade deficit declined in 2003 to $5.6 billion, 29 percent less than the $7.9 billion deficit in 2002, the finance ministry reported. The ministry said higher prices for Mexico's oil exports accounted for most of the decrease. The higher oil prices made up for stagnant manufacturing exports, which dipped 0.4 percent in 2003. Even though more than 90 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United States, Mexico's recovery has lagged that of the United States. But the figures for December exports suggest that the economy may finally be starting to rebound. Exports rose 11.2 percent, to $14.9 billion, in the last month of 2003. Manufacturing exports increased 10.2 percent. The figures were released on Monday.
