Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, and his Greek Cypriot counterpart, Tassos Papadopoulos, failed to reach an accord in emergency negotiations at the United Nations overseen by Secretary General Kofi Annan, but agreed to resume talks today to end the 30-year division of their island. The talks are intended to produce an accord in time for a reunited Cyprus to join the European Union on May 1.
