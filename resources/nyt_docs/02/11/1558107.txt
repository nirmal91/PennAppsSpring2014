An argument outside a laundry in the Bronx last night ended in a shooting in which three people, two of whom may have been innocent bystanders, were injured, the police said. None of the victims' wounds was life-threatening. About 11:30 p.m., the police answered reports of shots fired in front of 610 Castle Hill Avenue. Two men had been fighting, and one, who the police said was 23, fired shots from a revolver and from a semiautomatic gun. The shots wounded the man he was fighting with, as well as another man and a woman, the police said. It was not immediately clear if the other man and woman were involved in the fight. Police officers arrested the man they believe was the shooter.
