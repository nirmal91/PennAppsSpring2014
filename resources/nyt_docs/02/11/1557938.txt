To the Editor:
According to its marketers, the only problem with the SAT lies with test-prep organizations, which have ''worked this generation of students into a frenzy'' (''Film Makes SAT Villain, and Students Can Relate,'' Education page, Feb. 4).
They're wrong. The SAT gets little respect from educators or students because it is a limited and unfair test, one that the College Board spent 50 years claiming measured ''aptitude'' before finally abandoning that unsupportable claim in the 1990's. And it is far less predictive of college performance than most people -- including admissions officers -- believe.
Students are anxious not because we rile them up but because this arbitrary ordeal will largely determine where they spend their next four years and how much financial aid they will receive. Without doubt, we need an objective measure to help large schools judge applicants. But we can do much better than the SAT.
