A NEW JOB -- Just weeks after he stepped down as president and chief executive of Arista Records, Antonio Reid, as expected, has landed as chairman of the Island Def Jam Music Group. Mr. Reid, left, succeeds Lyor Cohen, who recently joined Time Warner Music as chief of North American operations. During his four years at Arista, Mr. Reid fostered the careers of artists like Avril Lavigne, Pink and Dido and led the label to 31 Grammy nominations this year. OutKast, a hip-hop duo Mr. Reid discovered nearly a decade ago, won album of the year and rap album Grammys on Sunday evening. Mr. Reid's sudden departure from Arista caught many in the industry by surprise. Huge financial losses were said to have played a part in his decision to resign. Doug Morris, chief executive of the Universal Music Group, described Mr. Reid in a statement as ''a multidimensional music man and entrepreneur, whose hallmarks have been a deep love of music and an incredibly successful track record in building the careers of world-class artists.''
