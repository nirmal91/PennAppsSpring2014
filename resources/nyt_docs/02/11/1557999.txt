Flight 34 had just taken off from Los Angeles for New York last Friday morning when the pilot's voice resounded through the cabin. We all know how soothing a ritual that can be: the generic tone of mellow understatement that is so reassuring a tool of modern pilots. The writer Tom Wolfe traces it to Chuck Yeager, the daring war ace and low-key test pilot with the ''poker-hollow West Virginia drawl'' emulated by successive generations of pilots.
But Flight 34 suddenly sounded as if the stick was in the hands of Elmer Gantry, not Chuck Yeager. The American Airlines pilot, Roger Findiesen, suggested that Christian passengers skip the movie and instead attest to their faith by raising their hands in the air. The master of the ship then invited an interfaith dialogue between the Christians and the nonbelievers strapped in their seats.
Passengers who begin their trips with the post-9/11 security routine -- removing their shoes, conscientiously discarding nail clippers -- are unlikely to respond well to a pilot bent on religious proselytizing. These days, it is particularly incumbent on the person in the cockpit to stick to cruising altitudes and arrival times. Diversions from the script are really not welcome, unless it's to point out that the Grand Canyon can be seen on the right.
Four and a half hours later, the plane landed, and the pilot, having heard of complaints in the cabin, genially offered to engage in further dialogue about the Lord. The airline is investigating, noting that Mr. Findiesen had recently visited a Christian mission and wanted to ''share his emotions.'' Yes, but find the man a ground-based pulpit. When Mr. Wolfe described pilotspeak as ''the drawl of the most righteous possessors of the right stuff,'' this wasn't what he had in mind.
