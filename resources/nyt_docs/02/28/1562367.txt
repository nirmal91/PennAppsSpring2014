To the Editor:
Re ''Elections With No Meaning'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Feb. 21):
Congressional districts may be created by drawing straight lines across a state from west to east, with each district having the same population, based on the most recent census.
Some districts would be wide and largely rural. Others would be narrow with their populations concentrated in their urban areas, thus encouraging diverse representation.
Such a mathematically based system would be neutral and fair. It would eliminate the corrupting influence of entrenched politicians of both parties. Other similarly neutral models may also be used to achieve the same ends.
