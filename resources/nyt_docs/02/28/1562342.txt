An advertisement that Pfizer placed in a French newspaper has stirred speculation in the rumor-rife world of deal makers that the company might be positioning itself to play some sort of role in the contested unsolicited bid by Sanofi-Synthélabo for Aventis.
On Monday, Pfizer ran a full-page ad in Les Echos that described the company's most popular pharmaceutical products with the tagline, ''Health is like family, you build it.'' Les Echos is the largest-circulation business newspaper in France and is closely read by most corporate executives there.
It is common practice in France to take out advertisements that boast of a company's strengths before attempting a takeover. Merger specialists said that the timing of the Pfizer ad, which comes as the legality of the Sanofi bid is being debated in a French courtroom, was puzzling.
''It has to be more than a coincidence,'' said Eric Cafritz, a partner with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, who is based in Paris. ''In these contested French bids, publicity is put to strategic use.''
Deal makers say they are trying, and failing, to find a motive. ''No one can work it out,'' said one deal adviser involved in the Aventis-Sanofi battle. ''Did they buy space cheap? Are they trying to improve their image? We just don't know.''
A spokeswoman for Pfizer, which is based in Manhattan, said that the ad was in line with the company's overall message. She would not comment further.
Sanofi announced a $60 billion bid for Aventis, its larger rival, on Jan. 26 and Aventis has been trying to fend off the bid. It would be unlikely that Pfizer would want to take over a combined Sanofi-Aventis because of antitrust issues, but a purchase of either company or their cast-off assets would be less contentious.
Speaking of the ad, analysts said that brand recognition was hardly a problem for the company. ''Pfizer is already quite well known in France,'' Marie Hélène Leopold, an analyst with SG Cowen in Paris, said.
