A woman was killed and several other people were seriously injured when two grenades exploded about 500 yards away from a political function near Srinagar attended by Kashmir's chief minister, Mufti Muhammad Sayeed. Mr. Sayeed, the state's highest elected official, escaped injury in the attack at Beerwa, 19 miles west of Srinagar. Last October, two militants unsuccessfully tried to storm Mr. Sayeed's official residence in Srinagar.
