Eric Lindros knows the routine. After the eighth concussion of his career, on Jan. 28, he knew he would have to wait for the cobwebs to clear. After that, light workouts would begin, followed by more strenuous exercise. Finally, he would be cleared to play.
''I love to play this game, and any chance you get to come back and play, you have to take advantage of it,'' Lindros said Friday at the Rangers' practice facility. ''I wouldn't come back here and put myself through this if I didn't think I could contribute.''
Lindros skated with pads for the first time since the concussion and he used an exercise bike. It was his third light workout of the week; he received permission Tuesday from Dr. Karen Johnston, a concussion specialist, to begin exercising. He will work out again Saturday, his 31st birthday. ''If all goes well this weekend, I'll talk to Dr. Johnston on Monday and we'll see,'' said Lindros, who hopes to start two-a-day workouts.
Lindros, who said he hoped to return before the March 9 trading deadline, is in the final season of his contract. The Rangers have an option at $10.25 million, which they are unlikely to pick up. There could be some interest in him near the deadline because any team that acquired him would pick up his contract only for the remainder of this season.
