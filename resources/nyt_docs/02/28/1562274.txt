To the Editor:
In ''Resorting to Facts'' (editorial, Feb. 23), you quote Mark McKinnon, the chief media adviser for President Bush, as saying:
''You don't hear the president in the Oval Office railing against the special interests.''
A more telling quote of this administration's sellout of the American people could not have been said any better.
