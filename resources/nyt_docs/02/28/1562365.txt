To the Editor:
Re ''Mr. Greenspan's Warning'' (editorial, Feb. 27):
How can you expect anyone to take you seriously when you say, ''Now the tax cuts have left the federal government practically helpless''? As if this is the only fiscal difficulty the nation has faced over the last three years.
Have there been no positive effects from the tax cuts? Are there no lingering negative effects of the 2000-2 recession? What about the cost of the war on terror? The polemic is so obvious that a reader who disagrees even moderately is stimulated to ignore the rest of the argument as well.
