Re ''To Trim Deficit, Greenspan Urges Social Security and Medicare Cuts'' (front page, Feb. 26):
The suggestion by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the federal deficit should be reined in through reductions in domestic spending, including Social Security, is outrageous. So is President Bush's cowardly response that were he to propose such cuts, they would not affect those at or near retirement.
These officials insult the intelligence of baby boomers, who have heard for more than 20 years about the impending crisis in financing these entitlements.
What is particularly distressing is to hear this recitation in the context of a historic opportunity lost -- the recent dissipation of enormous budgetary surpluses, compounded by the largest deficit in our history.
Perhaps our lost surplus was not in the right pot to solve the Social Security dilemma, but just as leaders can be creative in causing problems, surely they could have been creative in solving this one, if only they had the means.
