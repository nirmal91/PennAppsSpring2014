To the Editor:
Having just returned from a trip to Iraq, I can attest to the critical needs of that country. The destruction of Iraq's wetlands is certainly worthy of the United States help you chronicled (front page, Feb. 21).
Ironically, however, the Bush administration and the Republican-led Senate will not demand the same urgency of action to save coastal wetlands at home. Each year, Louisiana loses 25 to 35 square miles of coastal marsh, largely because of federal activities. And yet in their rewrite of the energy bill, Senate Republicans killed spending provisions addressing Louisiana's coastal loss, while our residents have done just the opposite -- dedicating state dollars to a federal-state restoration effort.
Congress has begun restoring the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades, and now we're restoring Iraq's wetlands. National leaders should address an environmental and economic crisis more significant than any of these: the loss of ''America's Wetland'' in coastal Louisiana.
