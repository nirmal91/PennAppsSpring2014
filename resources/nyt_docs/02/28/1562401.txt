The Planned Parenthood Federation of America said six affiliates received subpoenas this week for abortion records as the federal government prepares to defend a ban on certain abortion procedures. The federation has challenged the law, and the government sought the documents as evidence on the medical need for the procedure, which the law calls partial-birth abortion. The federation has provided some documents but refused to turn over materials that it said might identify patients.
