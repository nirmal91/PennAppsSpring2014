The growth rate in Canada accelerated to 3.8 percent, adjusted for inflation, in the final quarter of 2003 from 1.3 percent in the previous three months, Statistics Canada reported. But business and consumer spending stagnated, with the bulk of the improvement coming from a rise in inventories. The growth rate for the year was 1.7 percent, down from 3.3 percent in 2002. Seeking to stimulate demand, the Bank of Canada is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year when it meets to review monetary policy on Tuesday.
