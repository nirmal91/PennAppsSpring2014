The Rev. Maurice Gordon, who posted a sign that read, ''Jews Killed the Lord Jesus,'' on Ash Wednesday, has changed the sign, which now offers an apology. The sign outside the Lovingway United Pentecostal Church in Denver read: ''I am deeply sorry for offending the Jewish people, whom I love. Brother Gordon.'' The pastor said the release of ''The Passion of the Christ'' had motivated him to put up the first sign. The United Pentecostal Church International said in a statement that it did ''not now and has never in the past taught that the Jewish people as a race or nation are responsible for the death of Jesus Christ.'' The group did not mention Mr. Green, but it said ''the statement of one individual should not identify the U.P.C.I.''
