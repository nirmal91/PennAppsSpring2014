Hung Thanh Le, convicted in the death of a fellow refugee from Vietnam, was granted a stay of execution by Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat, at Hanoi's request an hour before the scheduled execution. Mr. Le, 37, was convicted of stabbing to death his business associate, Hai Nguyen, in 1992. Vietnam said it wanted more time to review the case.
