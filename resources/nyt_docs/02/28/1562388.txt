The government has expelled three Russian diplomats it accused of seeking, among other things, confidential information on the impeachment process against President Rolandas Paksas, according to the Foreign Ministry. The impeachment charge against Mr. Paksas involves allegations that link him to Russian organized crime. The explusions come as the small Baltic nation, a former Soviet republic, prepares to join the European Union and NATO.
