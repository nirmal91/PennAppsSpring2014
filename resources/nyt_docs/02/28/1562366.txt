To the Editor:
Re ''Elections With No Meaning'' (editorial, ''Making Votes Count'' series, Feb. 21):
You lament the prevalence of extreme gerrymandering. With new computer tools, gerrymandering can be an incredibly powerful tool for the party in power.
But Iowa, for example, has avoided the gerrymandering problem by using the new computer tools properly to provide balanced, compact districts in which elections are meaningful. Iowa has assigned the redistricting responsibility to an independent commission with clearly defined missions and goals.
