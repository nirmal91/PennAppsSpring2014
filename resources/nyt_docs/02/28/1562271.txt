To the Editor:
Your Feb. 24 Arts pages article about the documentary ''Capturing the Friedmans'' quotes a lawyer for four alleged victims claiming that Jesse Friedman's motion to vacate his guilty plea to charges of child molesting has ''no factual basis.''
As Mr. Friedman's lawyer, I can assure you that this 77-page motion is well documented through sworn affidavits and interviews. Most of these facts were concealed from Mr. Friedman during his initial legal proceedings, and only some are reflected in the film.
They include the use by detectives of highly suggestive interviewing techniques that elicit false accusations and false implanted memories; the concealment of this by the Nassau County district attorney; the complete absence of medical or physical evidence, despite the supposed abuse of hundreds of children; and the overt hostility of the trial judge.
Your article seems to confuse the film with a serious legal motion that includes compelling evidence that a defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that he did not commit. While the film does a brilliant job illustrating the complexities of the case, it doesn't show the degree to which my client was railroaded.
For both sides, an open hearing will allow these facts to be tested in court for the first time.
