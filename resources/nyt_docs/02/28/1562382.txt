The WPP Group, the advertising company, said that pretax profit before good will, taxes and special charges, rose 18 percent to £473.4 million ($884 million) in 2003. Sales were up 3.3 percent, to £18.62 billion. The company said that the outlook for 2004 was strong, but that 2005 might suffer because of the weak dollar and the heightened United States deficit.
