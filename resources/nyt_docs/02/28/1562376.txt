Attorney General Bill Lockyer of California asked the State Supreme Court on Friday to invalidate more than 3,400 same-sex marriage licenses and immediately halt the issuance of new licenses until the court could determine their constitutionality.
Late Friday, the court issued an order asking Mr. Lockyer to submit a brief by March 5 addressing the merits of the issues raised in his petition.
Mr. Lockyer's request came two days after opponents of gay marriage, frustrated by his inaction for two weeks, made a similar request to the court. Mr. Lockyer, a Democrat, has been under pressure to act from conservatives and from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. The court also ordered the opponents to file similar briefs.
''The attorney general's office should have gotten off their hands and dealt with this two weeks ago,'' said Robert Tyler, a lawyer with the Alliance Defense Fund, a group that has sought similar action from the court.
In the petition, the state urged the court to take over all legal proceedings for the gay marriage case and issue a stay for two related cases before judges in San Francisco County Superior Court.
