To the Editor:
''The Americano Dream,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 24), is right on the mark.
As a priest, I've worked among Latinos for years and know that they are going through the same process of assimilation as the Italians, Irish, Poles and other ethnic groups since the founding of the Republic.
I've noticed that Latino children may speak Spanish at home but will speak English among themselves on the playground. When Latinos climb the economic ladder, they leave their ghettos and buy better houses elsewhere, mixing in with the rest of the population.
Latinos will be as American as the other citizens of this country. They're enlisting in the defense of this country, and dying for it.
As the son of an Italian family that has given this country doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses, priests and statesmen, I am convinced that this country needs the fresh energies of Latinos and immigrants of all ethnic groups to keep America America.
