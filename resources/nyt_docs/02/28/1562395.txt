A man died yesterday in Brooklyn after crashing through a window on the third floor of an apartment building and plunging to the sidewalk below, the police said.
The police said they were investigating the case as a homicide, but could not say last night whether the man, Wilfred Isaacs, 49, had been pushed or had jumped to escape attackers. One detective said that at least one witness account indicated he had been thrown.
Witnesses said they heard cries for help from a male voice before Mr. Isaacs crashed through the window just after 4 p.m. He was pronounced dead shortly after, the police said.
The death puzzled the superintendent of the building, at 413 Nostrand Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, as the apartment Mr. Isaacs fell from had been vacant for more than a week. The superintendent, who identified himself only as Alex, said he did not recognize Mr. Isaacs, who the police said lived at 140 West 112th Street in Manhattan.
''It was a shock to the apartment, a shock to the tenants, a shock to everybody,'' said Alex, who added that no one should have been in the apartment Mr. Isaacs feel from.
Business owners across the street from the apartment building said a woman had been waiting in a car that was parked near the building just before Mr. Isaacs died.
It was unclear if he had been with the woman, or if she had been waiting for people who were planning to attack him. ''He apparently left the woman in the car, and went upstairs and then left headfirst from the building,'' said Nadine Wilkins, one of the business owners.
