Re ''The Americano Dream,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 24):
While indeed many immigrants are ''strivers'' and enrich our country with ''new energy,'' neither energy nor ambition is likely to result in immigrants' realizing the American dream of socioeconomic success if they are unable to find jobs.
The Hispanic unemployment rate is currently 7.3 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for all workers, and recent job gains among Hispanics have accrued disproportionately to very recent immigrants rather than to long-term residents.
Many of my relatives, who immigrated to the United States from Sweden, faced hardship during their first years in the United States because of unemployment, despite their motivation and eagerness. Should we not try to tackle immigrant unemployment before importing even more people seeking work?
