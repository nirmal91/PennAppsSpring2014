The F.B.I. system to discipline employees is riddled with problems and ''has lost touch with its original mission,'' according to a report from an independent commission. Among the major problems was that senior officials were often perceived as receiving lenient treatment for wrongdoing. The panel recommended reorganizing the disciplinary office and attracting ''high-caliber employees'' to work in it. The director of the bureau, Robert S. Mueller III, said he planned to adopt most of the changes.
