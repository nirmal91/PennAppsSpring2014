To the Editor:
Re ''Decline Seen in Science Applications From Overseas'' (news article, Feb. 26): As a visitor from India, I can say that the focus of Indian students for higher education has shifted from the United States to Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The schools in those countries offer similar facilities and free scholarships. Student fairs are often carried out across India. Spot admissions are issued based on student credentials.
