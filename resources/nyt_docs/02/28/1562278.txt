Re ''No Chads, at Least, but Confusion Is Likely as New York Goes to Polls'' (news article, Feb. 21):
The Board of Elections has taken many steps to help educate those who will be voting in the March 2 Democratic presidential primary.
The board has provided mandatory extra training for the more than 30,000 poll workers and inspectors who will be working on primary day.
In this training course, the poll workers are given a video that goes over problems that can arise at the polls and how to handle them.
This video has also been distributed to various public access TV stations in all five boroughs.
