The authorities said they had found the wreckage of President Boris Trajkovski's plane, which crashed in a mountain area in the southwest of Bosnia on Thursday, and they were recovering bodies. There were no survivors. The plane was also carrying six other officials and two pilots. Searchers reportedly found the flight recorders, which could provide investigators with clues to the cause of the crash.
