To the Editor:
In his recommendation to cut Social Security benefits, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was careful not to predict insolvency of the Social Security trust fund (front page, Feb. 26). In fact, large Social Security trust fund surpluses will exist at the same time as large deficits pervade the rest of the budget.
These surpluses can be found in the Social Security trustees' 2003 projections. The most pessimistic projection shows a balance of $4.7 trillion in 2020; the most optimistic shows positive balances through 2080.
The cutting of Social Security benefits must be seen in the context of the Republican policy to shrink government. Does Mr. Greenspan recommend dipping into the successful Social Security program to permit further tax cuts and eventually the diversion of the payroll tax to personal investment accounts?
Ignoring the financial strength of Social Security does not reflect an unbiased review of government fiscal policy.
