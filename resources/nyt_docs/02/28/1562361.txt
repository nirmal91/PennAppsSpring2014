Re ''To Trim Deficit, Greenspan Urges Social Security and Medicare Cuts'' (front page, Feb. 26):
Reducing Social Security and Medicare will not save money. It is penny-wise but pound-foolish to opt for treating advanced illnesses, epidemics and malnutrition that could be avoided by less costly preventive care, early treatment, and affordable medications and food.
The proposal by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is an expensive pass-along that will burden local and federal governments and the children of aging parents. Apart from lacking compassion, such fiscal plans are as illogical as thinking that astronomical budget deficits caused by $1.7 trillion in tax cuts will improve life for most Americans.
