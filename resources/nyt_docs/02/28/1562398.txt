Attorney General John Ashcroft has given Craig S. Morford, an assistant United States attorney in Cleveland, broad authority to examine the government's case against a terror cell in Detroit. Mr. Morford was named special attorney to the attorney general and assigned to the case through March 2005. Although three of the four men, all Arab immigrants, accused of forming the terror cell were convicted in June, questions about the case have accumulated since the removal of the lead prosecutor, Richard G. Convertino, in September. This month, Mr. Convertino sued Mr. Ashcroft and the Justice Department. Mr. Morford has been assisting a review of the case file ordered by Judge Gerald E. Rosen after the government's disclosure last year that it had withheld evidence.
