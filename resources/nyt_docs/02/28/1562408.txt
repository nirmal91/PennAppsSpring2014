Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about wariness by some Congressional Republicans over a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage referred incorrectly in some copies to the the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age. That amendment, adopted in 1971, was the last successful one initiated in by Congress in modern times, not the last successful one initiated by any Congress. (As noted elsewhere in the article, the last addition to the Constitution was the 27th Amendment, dealing with Congressional pay, which was ratified in May 1992, two centuries after being approved by Congress in 1789.)
