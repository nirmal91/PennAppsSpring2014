Re ''To Trim Deficit, Greenspan Urges Social Security and Medicare Cuts'' (front page, Feb. 26):
Reducing Social Security payments and Medicare reimbursements to the elderly is no different than if the government kept their benefits intact and then increased their income taxes in an amount equal to the proposed cuts.
Thus, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is advocating paying for the Bush tax cuts, which favor the wealthy, with what effectively is a tax increase on retirees.
Worse yet, since retirees spend a relatively high percentage of their income, the destimulating effect on the economy from this ''tax'' would be far more pronounced than the potential stimulating effect of giving tax breaks to the wealthy, who are less likely to spend all of their tax windfalls.
