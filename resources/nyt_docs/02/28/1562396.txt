Dignity Village, an encampment for the homeless that has been shuffled around Portland for four years, has a home on city property. The City Council voted to designate a one-acre corner of a leaf-composting center that tent village occupies, and the city will negotiate with the camp for a long-term lease. Dignity Village, with 60 residents, started in 2000 to protest a lack of housing options for the homeless.
