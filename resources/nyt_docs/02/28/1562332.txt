An article yesterday quoting senior Congressional officials reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee voted in a closed session on Thursday to move toward a possible subpoena if the Bush administration failed to produce, within the next three weeks, certain documents related to prewar intelligence on Iraq. The article referred to a bipartisan vote on the Republican-led panel, noting that it had set a three-week deadline for a voluntary surrender of the documents.
Late Thursday a senior member of the committee's staff telephoned The Times to dispute the account. When asked to elaborate, the staff member would say only that ''there was no timetable.'' That assertion was omitted from the article because it seemed to be contradicted by authoritative officials. It should have been reflected, and further reporting should have been done to reconcile the versions.
Yesterday the senior Congressional officials who provided the initial account of the vote and the timetable said they had misspoken. Senior Congressional officials said there had been only general discussion -- not a vote -- about a plan to compel the release of certain documents. A corrective article appears today, on Page A6.
