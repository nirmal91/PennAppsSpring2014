Russia halted shipments of natural gas to Belarus in a dispute over prices. Belarus has refused to pay market-rate tariffs, and in an escalation of a fight over subsidies, Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, said it would temporarily halt deliveries. Gazprom executives told news agencies that they were taking a hard line during negotiations in an effort to force Belarus to agree to accept market prices.
