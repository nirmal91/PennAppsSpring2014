Two environmental groups said yesterday that a settlement between the federal government and a corporation responsible for pollution in Newark Bay was intended to head off a lawsuit the groups had planned to file against the corporation. The Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the settlement on Friday, denied that claim. Bonnie Bellow, a spokeswoman for the agency, said yesterday that the settlement was a better way to bring about a cleanup than extensive litigation. Under the settlement, the Occidental Chemical Corporation and its affiliates agreed to pay for a study of industrial contaminants, including cancer-causing dioxins, in Newark Bay at an estimated cost of $7 million to $10 million. The settlement came just three days before the two environmental groups, New York/New Jersey Baykeeper and the Hackensack Riverkeeper, said they planned to sue.
