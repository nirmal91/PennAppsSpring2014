To the Editor:
Re ''Distorting the Intelligence'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
We are missing the core of the issue around our involvement in Iraq. What weapons Saddam Hussein had or did not have at a moment in time is secondary to his intent.
A man who gassed his own people, launched a war on his neighbor and tried to develop a nuclear bomb should be viewed as a threat. We have all seen how a commercial jet can become a weapon of mass destruction.
