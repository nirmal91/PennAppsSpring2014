To the Editor:
''Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers'' (front page, Feb. 14) portrays the community of literary writers as a nest of immature, insecure vipers who wait for the dark of night to scrawl anonymous graffiti on one another's work.
Since 1996, I've bought hundreds of books from Amazon.com. The first 10 or 20 reader reviews I read included one or two credible ones. Most of the others contained errors in grammar, syntax or spelling, or otherwise revealed that the reviewer was far from fully familiar with the context in which the book should be judged.
I no longer pay any attention to Amazon's anonymous reviews or to those signed by people I don't know.
