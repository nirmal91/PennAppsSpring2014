A federal judge yesterday upheld the City Department of Education's policy on holiday displays in the schools, ruling that it does not discriminate against Roman Catholics and other Christians. Judge Charles P. Sifton of Federal District Court ruled in a lawsuit filed by a Queens family, backed by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, who said their children's public schools allowed a menorah and an Islamic star and crescent to be displayed, but not a cr√®che, depicting the birth of Jesus. A Christmas tree was on display, but the family argued that the tree was not a religious symbol. The lawsuit argued that the menorah and the Islamic star and crescent were religious symbols, but Judge Sifton said they had ''significant secular connotations.'' He also said the department's policy was not an attempt to impose a particular religion on students.
