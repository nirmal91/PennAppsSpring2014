Graphic design and deadlines often seem to go hand in hand, so most designers welcome software that helps them do their work faster. CorelDraw 12, part of the new CorelDraw Graphics Suite 12 software package, recognizes rough shapes and drawings sketched onscreen with a mouse or a graphics pen, instantly turns them into smooth curves and lines, and properly positions them in a document.
Along with the CorelDraw program for page layout, illustration and drawing, Graphics Suite 12 includes Corel Photo-Paint for editing digital images and Corel RAVE for creating motion graphics in Macromedia's Flash format. The suite has an Export for Office feature that makes the Corel files compatible with documents created in the Microsoft Office or WordPerfect Office suites. Images and graphics can also be easily saved and imported into architectural and layout programs.
CorelDraw Graphics Suite 12 works with Windows 2000, XP and Tablet PC systems and sells for $399. A free 30-day trial version is available for downloading at www.corel.com/cdgs12, and the site offers several tutorials on using the software. To help newcomers get up to speed, the suite includes a two-hour interactive training video on CD and an increasingly rare companion for software: a 500-page printed manual, right in the box.
