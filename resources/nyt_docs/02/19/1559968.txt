To the Editor:
Re ''Anti-Semitism Still the Topic After Remarks During Game'' (news article, Feb. 14):
This sports incident made us aware that using terms like ''Passover,'' ''menorah'' and ''not kosher'' in sports jargon is anti-Semitic and unacceptable. Can we expect that using ''Hail Mary pass'' will be considered anti-Christian and dropped from football jargon?
