The Elan Corporation, the drug maker, said it would submit an application to the United States Food and Drug Administration by the middle of the year, a year ahead of schedule, for approval of Antegren, a drug for immune system disorders that it is developing with Biogen IDEC, as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. Antegren is also in trials as a treatment for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Elan reported a loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter, as it reduced expenses by about 40 percent, cut jobs and sold noncore assets. The full-year loss was $529 million. The chief executive, G. Kelly Martin, said Elan would lose $150 million to $170 million this year.
