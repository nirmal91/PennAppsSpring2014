A veteran New York City school safety officer was arrested on Tuesday and charged with sexual abuse and unlawful imprisonment in connection with an incident last June involving two 18-year-old male students at the High School for Humanities in Manhattan, the police and education officials said.
The arrest of the safety officer, Joseph Vasquez, was announced yesterday. It followed an investigation by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau, a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Christine Daugherty, said. The Manhattan district attorney's office was also involved in the investigation.
Officials said Mr. Vazquez, 43, groped the students in the basement of the High School for Humanities on West 18th Street, but they provided no further details of the encounter. The students did not file a complaint until September, officials said.
Mr. Vazquez was arrested at a Department of Education administrative office on East 28th Street, where he was reassigned after the complaint was filed. After his arrest, he was suspended from duty, officials said, and was offered an opportunity to resign, which he declined.
Education department officials said they first learned the details of his arrest yesterday after Benjamin Tucker, the chief executive for school safety, called the Police Department to ask about it.
Efforts to reach Mr. Vazquez by phone through the union representing school safety officers, Local 237 of the Teamsters, were unsuccessful.
Mr. Vazquez has been a school safety officer since February 1994. In 1997, the Police Department took over responsibility for school safety, and the agents are now employees of the Police Department.
