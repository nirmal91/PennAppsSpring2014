To the Editor:
I read ''Toll-Free Apology Soothes Wild Beast'' (Online Shopper, Feb. 12) a few days after wasting several hours driving around trying to find a DVD player at two large retail chains, visiting five stores before giving up. One of the stores had the player I wanted, but only a floor model, and they refused to sell it or to issue a rain check, since the item wasn't an advertised special.
I told the clerk ''No sale'' and walked out of the store. I went online, found the DVD player I wanted for $2 under the best price I had found at a bricks-and-mortar store, with free shipping and no local sales tax. The entire transaction took less than five minutes.
