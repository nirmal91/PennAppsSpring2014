Cadbury Schweppes, the candy maker, said it expected a higher profit in 2004, after being flat in 2003. Profit before tax, good will and exceptional items fell 1 percent, to Â£922 million ($1.7 billion) in 2003, in part because a hot summer hurt sales in Europe. Separately, Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company run by Warren E. Buffett, said in a regulatory filing that it had bought 10 million shares in Cadbury.
