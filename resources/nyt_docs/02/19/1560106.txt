A small business related to reality television is again the subject of a national campaign for the Open Small Business Network division of the American Express Company.
A television, print, radio and direct-mail campaign that begins Sunday by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, features David Collins, the co-founder with Michael Williams of Scout Productions in New York. Scout, a television and film production company, became familiar last year for its reality series for the Bravo cable network, ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' just as the subject of the 2003 campaign for Open, the chef Rocco DiSpirito, became well known for his role on the NBC reality series ''The Restaurant.''
''I would call it more of a coincidence'' than planned, Kerry Hatch, president for Open at American Express in New York, said yesterday. ''We were looking for a way to be 'hot' to break through in a cluttered marketplace with our target audience of credit-worthy small businesses, and reality TV is hot.''
The five ''Queer Eye'' cast members appear with Mr. Collins in the TV commercials. Mr. Collins said he agreed to be part of the campaign to help demonstrate that ''small business makes big things happen.''
