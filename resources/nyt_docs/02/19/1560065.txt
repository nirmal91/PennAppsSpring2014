To the Editor:
Re ''The Party of Kennedy, or Carter?,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 17):
Democrats did not conclude from the experience of Vietnam that America is not worth defending. They concluded that America cannot be defended by dishonest wars brutally prosecuted.
A belief in American ''exceptionalism'' and the American democratic mission is not the same thing as a policy that protects America's national security. Indeed, it is often quite the opposite.
It is no accident that the modern leaders who most strongly believed in America's right to preach to others -- Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush -- are the ones who had the least knowledge of, and the least curiosity about, how the world actually works.
