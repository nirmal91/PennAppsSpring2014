To the Editor:
''Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers'' (front page, Feb. 14) has finally revealed the laissez-faire practices of Amazon.com's reviewing system. The article deals mostly with fiction, however. But in the world of nonfiction, any competing author can post a review, negative or positive, and lie about the content or veracity of a reference book.
This has turned the review sections into bizarre, vitriolic chat rooms, which may entertain but ultimately do not help the customer make a good purchase.
And when buying a textbook where one is relying on facts, the wrong choice can have serious results.
