To the Editor:
The trade that brings Alex Rodriguez into the House That Ruth Built has been all the buzz in New York these last days (On Baseball column, front page, Feb. 16). Giddy Yankee fans have been unceasingly praising this almost mythic figure.
On the other side of the deal, the fate of Alfonso Soriano, traded in the deal to the Texas Rangers, has been noticeably overshadowed. A solid second baseman for the Yankees for three seasons, Soriano helped the Bronx Bombers to the World Series twice in the last three years. But where is the talk of his role in recent Yankee history and the usual remark that ''it's sad to see him go''?
It is a strong commentary on the psyche of Yankee fans that even before Soriano hands in his pinstripes, his image and his contributions to the team seem all but forgotten.
