A NEW generation of light fixtures provides little illumination, but lots of atmosphere -- from mood indigo to pretty in pink. Many of the fixtures change color, washing over rooms with their hues. Other low-level lights can replace drippy wax candles on a table. Some have L.E.D. bulbs, which are rechargeable and never burn out. But if you are looking for a good reading light, these won't fit the bill.
1. The Mood Light is a wall lamp that constantly changes color. A remote control adjusts the color patterns and the rate at which they change. A 20-inch-square unit with four colors is $399; nine units are shown above. At Lee's Studio, 220 West 57th Street, (877) 544-4869.
2. The 24-inch-long Thirteen Slide Light gives a low-level background glow. Personal slides mounted in glass can be inserted into the fixture, which hangs vertically or horizontally; $250. A four-foot-long version is $325; at the Terence Conran Shop, 407 East 59th Street, (866) 755-9079 or www.conran.com.
3. The Spike Wall Light by Tom Kirk, a London designer, is an anodized aluminum box with multicolor resin spikes lighted by a hidden neon tube. It comes in two sizes: 7 inches by 38 inches ($590), or 40 inches square; $3,250 at the Terence Conran Shop.
4. The Flora Dee table lamp, by Ingo Maurer, is a circuit board with 221 10-watt L.E.D. bulbs. The lights turn on and off when the lamp is touched; $2,940 at Moss, 146 Greene Street (Houston Street), or (866) 888-6677 or www.mossonline.com.
