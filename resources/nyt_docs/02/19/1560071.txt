To the Editor:
Re ''Distorting the Intelligence'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
If this administration, or the next, identifies a truly imminent threat, it will be much harder for the world, or our country, to take action.
Exaggerating the threat of Iraq has produced a dangerous and unintended consequence. Who will believe a president, or a country, that cried wolf, when no wolf was to be found?
