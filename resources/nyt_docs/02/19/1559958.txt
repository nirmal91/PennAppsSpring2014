If you have a high-definition television set but your cable company has yet to add high-definition signals, relief may be at hand. In many areas, broadcasters are transmitting digital versions of their programming on separate over-the-air channels.
Apartment dwellers and other people who cannot install outdoor aerials can, in theory at least, use old-fashioned rabbit-ear antennas to pick up those HDTV channels.
But Jean-Jacques L'Hénaff, vice president for product design at Terk Technologies, an antenna manufacturer, said reception of high-definition television signals can be tricky.
When a conventional analog television signal is weakened by distance or distorted by mountains or high buildings, it remains viewable, if imperfect. With the digital signals used for high-definition television, however, such obstacles cause the television screen to go blank, Mr. L'Hénaff said.
Now his company offers Terk HDTVi, a $40 set-top directional antenna intended to give users a fighting chance of plucking high-definition pictures out of the airwaves. The antenna's branches are tuned to receive a broader range of frequencies than the rabbit ear.
But the antenna's high-tech form goes beyond the merely functional, Mr. L'Hénaff said. ''When someone spends between $2,000 and $3,000 on a TV set,'' he said, ''they do not want to add a typical rabbit ear.''
