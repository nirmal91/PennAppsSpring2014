A New Jersey woman, Michele Scimeca, one of the hundreds of people accused of copyright infringement by the Recording Industry Association of America, has countersued the big record labels, accusing them of extortion and violations of the federal antiracketeering act. The suit is one of just a handful of countersuits. Even critics of the recording industry view the suit as a long shot but one worth trying, and as a sign that lawyers are working on arguments against the recording association. Through her lawyers, Ms. Scimeca contends that by suing file swappers for copyright infringement, then offering to settle instead of pursuing a case in which liability could reach into hundreds of thousands of dollars, the association is violating the laws that are more typically applied to gangsters and organized crime. According to the association, which filed its latest round of lawsuits against 531 as-yet-anonymous individuals on Tuesday, it has settled with 381 people, including some who had not yet actually had suits filed against them. A total of nearly 1,500 people have been sued so far. ''If someone prefers not to settle, they of course have the opportunity to raise their objections in court,'' an R.I.A.A. representative said yesterday. ''We stand by our claims.''
