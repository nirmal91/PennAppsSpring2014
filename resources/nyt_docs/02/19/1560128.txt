A theater review on Tuesday about a pair of one-act plays by Terrence McNally misspelled the 19th-century novelist's name that forms part of the overall title. As shown correctly in the subheading and picture captions, it is ''The Stendhal Syndrome,'' not Stendahl. The article also misidentified a major award won by Mr. McNally's 1995 play ''Master Class.'' It was the Tony Award, not the Pulitzer Prize.
