In a video broadcast on television, two members of the armed Basque separatist group E.T.A. announced that it was unilaterally declaring a cease-fire for the northern region of Catalonia ''with the aim of uniting ties between the Basque and Catalan peoples.'' The move follows a meeting last month between E.T.A. leaders and a top minister in the Socialist-led Catalan government. The minister, who claimed his objective was to negotiate a truce with the radical group, was forced to resign when the meeting became known. Political parties across Spain refuse to negotiate with the guerrilla group and criticized the limited cease-fire.
