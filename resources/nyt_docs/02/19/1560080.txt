On loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, 212 masterworks -- a number reflecting Manhattan's most widely recognized area code -- go on view tomorrow in Berlin. Running through Sept. 19 at Mies van der Rohe's framed glass and steel New National Gallery, the exhibition, ''MoMA in Berlin,'' includes ''Starry Night'' by van Gogh, ''The Dance'' by Matisse and ''Drowning Girl'' by Roy Lichtenstein. Among other artists represented in the event, whose honorary patrons are Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, are Picasso, Hopper, Miró, Dalí, O'Keeffe and Pollock. ''This exhibition shows what Berlin might have become without Adolf Hitler, without the banning of so-called degenerate art, without the East German ghetto,'' Peter-Klaus Schuster, the director of the New National Gallery, said at a news conference yesterday. German and American organizers depicted the display of painting and sculpture not only as the year's cultural highlight in Germany but also as a special gesture of trans-Atlantic friendship between their countries after tensions over the war in Iraq and as a symbol of Berlin's swift return to European cultural prominence. In return for the loan from the Museum of Modern Art, which is undergoing renovation, the New National Gallery will send some of its most famous Expressionist works to New York for an exhibition at the Neue Galerie from March 12 through June 7.
