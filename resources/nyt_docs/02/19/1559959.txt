If hefty digital video files, thousands of MP3 songs and scads of JPEG images are crowding your computer's 30- or 40-gigabyte hard drive, you may want to ease the space crunch by supersizing your system with an external hard drive.
There are plenty of big drives that can add a few hundred gigabytes of extra space. And then there is the LaCie Bigger Disk hard drive, which holds a full terabyte -- that's right, 1,000 gigabytes -- of data.
The Bigger Disk can hook up to the computer in three different ways: U.S.B. 2.0, the common FireWire 400 and the newer FireWire 800 connection, a feature of several high-end Macintosh models. (The U.S.B. 2.0 port is also compatible with the older, slower U.S.B. 1.1 connection.) For convenience, digital video buffs can even connect camera to computer through the Bigger Disk's FireWire 400 port.
The drive works with Windows 2000 and XP and with Macintosh OS 9 and X; no software drivers are needed with Windows XP and Mac OS X. The Bigger Disk can be ordered for $1,199 at www.lacie.com.
To put the notion of a terabyte into perspective, think of it in terms of continuous music: LaCie estimates that a Bigger Disk filled with typical music tracks could spin out tunes for the next two years.
