The International Red Cross strongly criticized Israel's separation barrier in the West Bank, saying that sections of it usurped land envisioned for a Palestinian state and deprived thousands of Palestinians of access to water, health care and education. ''The construction of the West Bank barrier continues to give rise to widespread appropriation of Palestinian property and extensive damage to or destruction of buildings and farmland,'' the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Israel had gone ''far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power under international humanitarian law.'' Israel says the barrier is intended as a security measure against suicide bombers and other Palestinian attacks.
