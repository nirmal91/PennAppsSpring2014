The prototype for a jet plane (above) by the Australian designer Marc Newson (right) made Paris feel like a cutting-edge design center during the Maison et Objet show last month. ''Kelvin 40,'' as the project is called, was shown at the Fondation Cartier Pour l'Art Contemporain, which commissioned it. Mr. Newson has had a lifelong fascination with jets. ''To me they were glamorous, beautiful streamlined objects that gave me the nearest thing to an out-of-this-world experience,'' he said. ''If I hadn't quit college, I would have become an aeronautics engineer.''
Instead, Mr. Newson turned to design. He is known for his chairs for Cappellini, a prototype car for Ford, the design of the business-class seats for Qantas and the restaurant at Lever House in New York.
The 26-foot-long ''Kelvin 40'' two-seater has a 26-foot wingspan. Its name refers to Chris Kelvin, a character in the Stanislaw Lem novel ''Solaris'' and Lord Kelvin, the 19th-century Scottish physicist and mathematician, and also to Mr. Newson's age. The ''Kelvin 40'' exhibition and catalog show his sketches, aerodynamic studies and construction photographs.
Through May 2 at the Fondation Cartier, 261, boulevard Raspail, then from May 22 to Sept. 6 at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands and from Oct. 23 to Jan. 30, 2005 at the Design Museum in London. The catalog is $38 from the Fondation Cartier bookstore, 011-33-1-42-18-56-72; information, www.fondationcartier.fr.
