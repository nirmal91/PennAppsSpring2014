President Bush, helping to inaugurate a new American television network in the Middle East, said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that the United States would continue to press its plan for a Palestinian state and for democracy in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab countries.
Speaking on the Middle East Television Network, part of a new United States-sponsored system aimed at getting the American message across in the region, Mr. Bush described himself as ''the first president to have ever articulated a Palestinian state,'' but said that this goal had been undercut by terrorists.
''The road map is in place,'' Mr. Bush said. ''What has failed is, some parties are not advancing on the road map. They're stuck.''
Mr. Bush ascribed the lack of progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who he said has undermined the peace process by failing to fight against terrorism.
He also said he hoped that with United Nations help, sovereignty could be restored to Iraq by June 30, and that disagreement on government among Sunnis, Kurds and Shiites was ''very positive'' because it reflected democratic stirrings.
In Arabic, the Middle East Television Network is known as ''Al Hurra,'' or ''The Free One.'' It is intended as a version of Radio Free Europe for the Middle East, American officials say. Mr. Bush's interview was taped Jan. 29.
