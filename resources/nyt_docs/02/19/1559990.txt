To the Editor:
In ''Beware of Generals Bearing a Grudge'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 13), Jean Edward Smith tossed aside the subject of his article, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, as one of the generals who became ''political also-rans.''
Mr. Smith devotes three-quarters of his article to a roundup of other ''also-ran'' generals whose histories and attributes have little to do with those of General Clark. Why detail their weaknesses if not to draw General Clark into guilt by association?
As supreme allied commander of NATO forces in the war in Kosovo, General Clark held together a multilateral alliance that helped save many thousands of Albanians from ethnic cleansing, with no allied deaths in combat. Surely he deserves the same vigilant examination Mr. Smith confers upon the lives of Ulysses S. Grant and John Marshall in his biographies.
