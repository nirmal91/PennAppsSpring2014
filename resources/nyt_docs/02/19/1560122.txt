An article on Saturday about the selection of an architect for an addition to the United Nations complex misstated the expected cost of an esplanade that the organization plans to finance in return for taking over the Robert Moses Playground. The United Nations has committed millions of dollars, not $100,000. (The esplanade is to be 100,000 square feet.)
