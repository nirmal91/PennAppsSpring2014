By 2015, the rents for at least 40,000 of the 120,000 city apartments covered under the state's Mitchell-Lama housing program might no longer be subsidized if dozens of contracts for buildings are not renewed and owners are allowed to rent the apartments at market rates, according to a report released yesterday by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. For the nearly 50 years the program has been in place, the report said, about 21,000 of the original 140,000 apartments in dozens of buildings have been removed from the Mitchell-Lama program, which subsidizes rents for low- and middle-income tenants. Eleven more buildings, with a total of 4,800 units, have submitted formal notices to opt out, and 59 buildings with an additional 40,000 units -- mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn -- could leave by 2015, according to the report.
