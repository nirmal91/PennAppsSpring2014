Emery et Cie., a rarefied French version of the home improvement store, has moved to new two-level quarters in Paris. The boutique offers intensely colored paints, handmade Moroccan tiles, fabrics, ironwork and ceramics. ''I prefer to work with craftsmen who give a place for human imperfection and accident, and finally identity,'' said Agn√®s Emery (above right), the owner and designer. Casein paints (top left), in 83 colors, are about $117 for a bit over a gallon. The large paint swatches are $3 each. Mirrored tiles (bottom right), about four inches square in eight colors, are about $4 each, less in quantity. Fabrics (the organdy, lower left, is $19 for almost 40 inches in 51 colors) can be screen-printed from a large selection of patterns. Printing is $70 to $210 an image. All items can be shipped; you will be stopped if you try to take the paint on the plane with you. Emery et Cie., 18, passage de la Main d'Or, near rue du Faubourg St.-Antoine. 011-33-1-44-87-02-02 or brussel@emeryetcie.com.
