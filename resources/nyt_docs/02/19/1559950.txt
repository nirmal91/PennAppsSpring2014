How often do cellphones go dead, just when you need them most? Now there is a tiny charger, less then two inches by three inches, powered by four AAA batteries. The charger, with adapters, fits Nokia, Ericsson, Sony Ericsson, Samsung and Siemens phones. It is available in Paris at Muji, 47, rue Francs-Bourgeois for about $11, and will be available for $15 in May at the MoMA Design Store, 44 West 53rd Street or 81 Spring Street (Crosby Street).
