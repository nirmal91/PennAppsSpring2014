It is reasonably well established that eBay sellers who post pictures of their wares online attract more bidders than those who just describe without showing. Logic suggests that if a picture helps, a moving picture will help even more.
A new Web site allows anyone with a Webcam and, preferably, a high-speed Internet connection to put that proposition to the test. At www.auctionvideo.com, subscribers can record and store video clips of up to 60 seconds apiece for use with online auction listings.
''Videos are the natural progression for online auctions,'' said Scott Lazerson, who started Auction Video with a partner, Gregg Ellis. ''They allow you to explain and demonstrate the product. And people are more comfortable buying from you if they can see your face.''
To make an auction video, you plug in your equipment, sign up for a ''recording room'' and click ''record.'' When you are happy with your infomercial, the site's software embeds it in a string of HTML code. You post it by clicking Copy and pasting the code into your auction listing.
The site charges a monthly subscription rate that increases with the number of items you wish to post for sale: for one item, $10 a month (though you can make as many video clips as you like for the item), $20 for two items, and so on -- an expensive proposition if your product is worth less than $100. Of course, a video sales pitch could cut both ways. Might the sight of the seller's face -- not to mention seeing how a product actually works -- drive more away more bidders than it attracts?
