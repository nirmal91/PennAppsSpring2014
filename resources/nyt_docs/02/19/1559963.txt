While Baghdad is not likely to be the next big tourist destination, a Massachusetts company that makes nautical charts and other navigation tools is betting that a CD offering maps of the Iraqi capital's streets will find an audience in the United States.
Martin Fox, a spokesman for Maptech, said that people could use the digital maps to track the locations of loved ones who are with the military or in Iraq for some other reason.
''A lot of people want to know exactly where their partner is,'' Mr. Fox said.
The main source for the maps on the $200 CD, which also cover major intercity roads and highways, is a company that supplies complex Geographic Information Systems maps to the military and other customers. The base maps were reformatted to resemble conventional road maps, Mr. Fox said, and, to the best of the company's knowledge, reflect the current state of Baghdad's road system.
The CD is available only from Maptech, and can be ordered online at www.maptech.com or by phone at (888)839-5551.
Maptech Pocket Navigator, an additional $100 software package, allows the Baghdad maps to be loaded into most palmtop computers that use the Pocket PC operating system. The software will also work with Global Positioning System attachments for hand-helds, enabling users to figure out where on the maps they might actually be.
