To the Editor:
Re ''For IPod, 6 Flavors of Flattery'' (State of the Art, Feb. 12), a review of some high-capacity digital audio players:
The digital audio player market is reaching critical mass, with numerous products and companies vying for attention and many options for consumers to choose from. These products offer a variety of advantages and disadvantages, and it is difficult for consumers to wade through this information to find the right player.
The column starts with the assumption that the Apple iPod must be superior and continues to reinforce that credo throughout. The article is colored by snide comments about the iPod's competitors and unabashed praise for the iPod beyond what any responsible piece of journalism should allow.
For example, it states: ''Most have the familiar iPod ingredients: a screen, a tiny hard drive and a rechargeable battery, all packed into a rectangular case and accompanied by earbuds.''
The portable digital audio player market was started by Rio, not by Apple and its iPod. It was furthered by Creative Labs, another company that happens not to be Apple. But from the above quotation you would think Apple singlehandedly created the space and the form from nothing.
