To the Editor:
In ''The Party of Kennedy, or Carter?'' (column, Feb. 17), David Brooks describes President Harry S. Truman's and John F. Kennedy's responses to tyranny with military means as an ''idealistic'' struggle, but that trivializes the decisions of those periods. World War II and the Cuban missile crisis were not based on abstract principles. There were real and concrete events taking place -- invasions, totalitarianism and genocide.
Mr. Brooks also speaks of the belief in America's ''exceptionalism'' and the ''hawk resurgence'' of the Reaganites. Let's remember that America's military support in those years was applied very selectively, often on behalf of horrendous leaders, with the decision being based on whether they were ostensibly anti-Communist.
It is time to speak the bare-bones truth and not insult the American people with language that appeals to the baser instincts of chauvinism and false glory.
