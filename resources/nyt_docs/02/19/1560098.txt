To the Editor:
Re ''Toll-Free Apology Soothes Wild Beast'' (Online Shopper, Feb. 12), on glitches at shopping sites and the response from customer service: My last go-round with a travel Web site took six weeks to correct. I shopped for airline tickets, and two hours later and drenched in sweat, pushed the Submit button and was informed that my tickets would arrive by FedEx in two days. They did.
And then they did again, two days after that: same airline, same flight, same date, same seats, even. And same charge. After being bounced around the travel site's customer service and being refused access to anybody at the originating or fulfillment desks, I was finally told this was an airline problem and that I had to deal with them.
I think I finally made them attend to my two-fer problem by disputing the second set of tickets with my credit card company, which let me know that the airlines account for a sizable chunk of their angry calls.
My wife says I will live longer if I do as she does: shop the Net, then order directly by phone and accept the premium as the cost of peace of mind.
