To the Editor:
Re ''Distorting the Intelligence'' (editorial, Feb. 17):
The Senate Intelligence Committee should not only look into the reasons behind the flawed intelligence and the extent to which the administration misused it, but also examine the underlying motives for the war in Iraq.
Much has been written about how this administration planned for war in Iraq before 9/11. As President Bush so often reminds us, he is a wartime president, and Americans have a history of rallying behind their commander in chief.
Congress and the media have the responsibility to investigate whether this war was undertaken for political advantage, as it is now apparent there was no threat, imminent or otherwise, to our country.
