To the Editor:
Re ''The Party of Kennedy, or Carter?,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 17):
Today's Democratic Party is one that is tempered by war, centrist and careful yet one that is ready to apply force. It realizes that force is only one tool in a great American toolbox full of skill, ingenuity and good will.
The Republican Party is now a radical party, run by men untempered because of their lack of service, who are unable to shake the polemical dust out of their eyes and see the complexities of the problems we face abroad.
