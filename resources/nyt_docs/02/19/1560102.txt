To the Editor:
I would like to suggest using a different Web browser when you have difficulty with online purchasing. Each Web browser responds differently to each Web site, so keeping more than one browser installed is a worthwhile practice.
Why should this be necessary? Because, despite the lack of uniformity among browsers, many Web site designers don't test their creations with a variety of browser software.
I have had many experiences in which one browser wouldn't let me complete my purchase, but another sailed through just fine. Unfortunately, this means repopulating your shopping cart if you discover the problem after making all your selections. But it makes the difference between pulling your hair out and moving on with life.
