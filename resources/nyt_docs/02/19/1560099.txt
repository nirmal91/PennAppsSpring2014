The lower house of Parliament overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment to extend the president's term of office to seven years, from four years. The Parliament, dominated by the party loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin, took up the proposal earlier this month even though Mr. Putin had publicly opposed making any changes in the Constitution. Some described the vote as a trial balloon or a pre-election political ploy that would allow Mr. Putin to reassure those who fear any increase in his presidential powers. He is universally expected to win a second term in the presidential election on March 14.
