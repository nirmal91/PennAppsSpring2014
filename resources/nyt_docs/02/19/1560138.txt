Shea Fink, deputy chief of staff to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has been named a senior adviser to the mayor. She replaces Vincent A. LaPadula, who left last month to become a vice president for J.P. Morgan Chase. Ms. Fink has been deputy chief since 2002, responsible for Mr. Bloomberg's schedule and his advance team. In her new role, she will continue to oversee scheduling and advance work, but will also advise Mr. Bloomberg on community outreach strategies and other initiatives, according to a news release. Mr. LaPadula, one of the few Republicans in senior positions in the Bloomberg administration, often served as the liaison between the mayor and more conservative corners of the city.
