A 14-year-old middle school student in Miami-Dade County was charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the slashing death of a classmate. The boy, Michael Hernandez, could face a life sentence without parole if convicted of killing Jaime R. Gough, an eighth grader at Southwood Middle School in Miami. He signed a confession after the murder weapon was found in his backpack.
