To the Editor:
While Dr. Thomas R. Frieden's policies as New York City's health commissioner may create discontent, they work (''Gladly Taking the Blame for Health in the City,'' news article, Feb. 14).
The smoking cessation program he developed helped me quit after 20 years and many failed attempts.
Increasing the tax on a pack of cigarettes and banning smoking in bars and restaurants caused me a lot of economic and social discomfort, but that was the point. The city's program also offered a free six-week supply of nicotine patches, a ''carrot'' to assuage the use of such hard sticks. The combination was as brilliant as it was effective.
Thanks to Dr. Frieden, living in New York City has brought unforeseen health benefits.
