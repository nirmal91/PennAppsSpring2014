Two men who were acquitted in a state trial in the shooting death of Derwin Brown, a sheriff-elect for DeKalb County, have been arrested on federal charges in the same case. An indictment charged the men, Melvin Walker and David Ramsey, with conspiring in the murder-for-hire of Mr. Brown. Jurors at their 2002 trial said they did not believe prosecution witnesses, who admitted conspiring to kill Mr. Brown but received immunity from murder charges for their testimony against Mr. Walker, Mr. Ramsey and former Sheriff Sidney Dorsey. Mr. Dorsey, whom Mr. Brown had defeated in a bitter election, was convicted of ordering the four other men to commit the murder and is serving a life sentence.
