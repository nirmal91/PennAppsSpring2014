To the Editor:
You write (editorial, Feb. 17) that intelligence errors were ''compounded when the president and other senior officials emphasized unlikely worst-case scenarios to win support for the invasion.'' Worst-case scenarios by definition are improbable, and it is fanciful retrospection to conclude duplicity when they don't come to pass.
In the face of unknowables, I expect my leaders to know their first priority: protect Americans.
One thing is knowable and certain: The actions of the coalition in freeing Iraq will improve the future of Iraqis in particular and the Middle East in general. And that will in turn make Americans safer.
