The painterly espresso cups by Mariavera Chiari (right), 32, an architect and designer from Milan, are inspired by disposable paper cups. The ceramic versions, with cups at about $13 each and spoons about $10 each, come in 25 colors (each is white on the outside, and bears the word espresso). Ms. Chiari also makes similar ice cream bowls and spoons ($20 and $13) in flavor-matched colors (red for strawberry). To order, mvx100@libero.it; information, www.mv-ceramicsdesign.com.
