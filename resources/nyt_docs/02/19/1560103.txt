To the Editor:
Amazing how in desperate moments, how something is said actually becomes more important than what's being said. Unfortunately, too many retailers -- as the Online Shopper column pointed out so well -- don't realize that those two little words, ''I'm sorry,'' can and often do make all the difference in the world.
In those cases, ''customer service'' is clueless service.
