To the Editor:
''Distorting the Intelligence'' (editorial, Feb. 17) indicates that the administration tended to err on the side of an overestimate of the threat from Iraq. Critics may not gain much advantage in saying the war was useless (who would want to say it was useless to be rid of Saddam Hussein?), but no one can deny that it was a mistake not to wait for the United Nations coalition to fall in with the United States, if only to help foot the bill.
I hope that this distinction is not lost on Senator John Kerry, who is such a formidable debater. If the Republicans were so determined to go into Iraq, as it now seems that they were since just days after the inauguration, why did they choose the financially disastrous unilateral course, when we could certainly have waited for our allies?
