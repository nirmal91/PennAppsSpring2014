The rebuilding of the Jets' coaching staff was completed yesterday when they named Bob Casullo as tight ends coach. Casullo, who spent four seasons as the Oakland Raiders' special teams coach, replaces Dick Curl, who was the tight ends coach last season and will become the senior offensive assistant/special projects. Jim Hostler, who coached quarterbacks last season, will become wide receivers coach.
