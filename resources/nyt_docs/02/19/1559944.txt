Isabel Gu√©don (above) and her husband, Benjamin Caron, operate Deuce, which sells handmade luxury leather games and accessories. The leather is layered and finished in a process that can take months (hence the heady prices). A backgammon table (top), made of maple and leather, is about $22,500. (The dice and playing pieces are also leather.) Other products include dominoes and chess and checker sets. The portraits (above), in stamped and dyed leather, are of Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Jeanne Moreau. Deuce is at 7, rue d'Aboukir; 011-33-1-42-21-12-95 or www.deuce.free.fr. Portraits ($2,500) and other items are at Donna Karan, 819 Madison Avenue (68th Street), New York; (866) 240-4700.
