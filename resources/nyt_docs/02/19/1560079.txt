To the Editor:
Amazon.com could greatly reduce the number of misleading book reviews (front page, Feb. 14) if it accepted reviews only from people who actually bought the book.
Given the ease with which friends can praise an author's book and enemies defame it, I'm surprised that anonymous reviews have any credibility.
