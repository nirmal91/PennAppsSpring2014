The United States Tennis Association yesterday named Patrick McEnroe and Zina Garrison as the coaches of the men's and women's teams for the Summer Olympics in Athens. McEnroe, 37, has been the captain of the United States Davis Cup team since 2001, when he succeeded his older brother, John. Garrison, 40, succeeded Billie Jean King two months ago as the captain of the United States Fed Cup team.
Tennis at the Games will be played Aug. 15 to 22. The United States expects to enter six men and six women. Four men and four women will be eligible to play singles, and there will be two doubles teams for men and two for women. The coaches and federation officials must choose the teams by June 28.
The United States has 6 of the 28 highest-ranked men in the world: Andy Roddick, Andre Agassi, Mardy Fish, Taylor Dent, Robby Ginepri and Vince Spadea. Four of the top 10 women are Americans -- Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati, Serena Williams and Chanda Rubin.
Of those ranked players, only Agassi is not an Olympic candidate because he did not make himself available for Davis Cup matches in the last two years.
