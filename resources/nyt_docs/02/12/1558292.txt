A commission studying President Bush's goal of sending astronauts to the Moon and Mars expressed confidence on Wednesday that it could develop a workable plan to do it, despite some doubts about financing.
''We are not here to challenge or modify the plan, but to find ways for it to work,'' Edward C. Aldridge, chairman of the nine-member group, said at the commission's first public hearing. ''It is highly unlikely that we would conclude at the end of this that it can't be done.''
Mr. Aldridge said his group could probably come up with a strategy within four months.
Some questions were raised, however, about the feasibility of a project that could take decades to complete and about the many billions of dollars that future leaders would have to allocate for it.
Norman Augustine, a retired Lockheed Martin chairman and the head of a commission that looked at the future of the space program 14 years ago, warned that financing could be a problem. ''It would be a grave mistake to undertake the major new space objective on the cheap,'' he told the commission. ''To do so, in my opinion, would be an invitation to disaster.''
He said the earlier study by his panel found that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was badly overcommitted with programs that exceeded its resources and that the agency lacked a national consensus on what the space program should be doing.
He said he feared that those circumstances still existed.
To start the new Moon-Mars program, Mr. Bush has proposed a $1 billion increase in NASA's budget spread over five years. This new money would be added to $11 billion taken from other NASA programs.
Gen. Thomas Stafford, a former astronaut who has served on several committees studying NASA, said accomplishing the new objectives would require several technological advances, including developing nuclear rockets and power sources, and a new way of running the program.
