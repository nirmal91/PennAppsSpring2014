French prosecutors are investigating bank transfers of $11.4 million to accounts controlled by Suha al-Taweel Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian leader, French media reported Wednesday.
The inquiry, disclosed by a satirical French weekly, Le Canard Enchaîné, and confirmed by unidentified judicial officials to The Associated Press, was opened in October after the Bank of France notified the Paris prosecutor's office that Mrs. Arafat's accounts at two banks in France had received relatively regular transfers of nearly $1.27 million each from Switzerland between July 2002 and September 2003. The newspaper also reported that about $2.5 million of the money had been diverted to an account of an interior decorating firm, Alberto Pinto.
The officials told The A.P. there was no evidence that the funds came from illicit sources.
Mrs. Arafat, 40, who lives in Paris with a 7-year-old daughter, could not be reached for comment.
Le Canard Enchaîné also reported that the European Union had begun an investigation into management of an estimated $444 million in aid that the union is giving the Palestinian Authority. The aid accounts for about a third of the authority's budget.
News of the inquiries come on the heels of wide resignations from Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction, the largest section in the Palestine Liberation Organization, amid charges of widespread corruption among Fatah leaders.
About 400 activists, representing Fatah's younger generation, signed a public letter of resignation over the weekend, complaining that Fatah is mismanaged and demanding elections for new leaders.
