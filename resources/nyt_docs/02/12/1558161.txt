If choosing fabric from tens of thousands of deeply discounted bolts and a wide selection of trims is appealing, you can try Mary Jo's Cloth Store in Gastonia, N.C., 20 miles from Charlotte. If visiting is not convenient, the store does business by phone and mail. The staff will search stock based on descriptions, photos or small cloth samples. The choice is varied, including curtain sheers and durable outdoor fabrics. For a charge, swatches can be sent (a sixteenth of a yard is the smallest). The store, open Monday through Friday, is in the Gastonia Mall, 401 Cox Road, Gastonia 28054; www.maryjos.com or (800) 627-9567.
