The Old Navy division of Gap Inc. is beginning a search for an outside agency to help its advertising team create campaigns for the general market. Old Navy spends about $150 million a year on such ads.
The decision came after two sibling Gap Inc. divisions, Gap and Banana Republic, hired outside agencies to help their internal teams; Gap hired Laird &amp; Partners in New York and Banana Republic hired Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. Old Navy hired an outside agency last year, the Vidal Partnership in New York, to help produce ads aimed at Latino consumers.
''Having an outside perspective, fresh insights and ideas to join those from our successful in-house team, will help position us for future growth,'' a spokesman for Old Navy, Jonathan Finn, said.
Old Navy has hired Pile &amp; Company, a search consultant in Boston, to help manage the review, Mr. Finn said, adding that a ''select group of agencies'' was being asked to take part; he declined to identify them. A decision is expected by late April, Mr. Finn said. The review does not affect the Old Navy media agency roster, which includes PhD in New York, part of Omnicom.
