To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released'' (front page, Feb. 11):
Those who are inclined to accept military pay stubs as proof of service should heed the experience of my father.
In 1941, John Spore was an editor with Infantry Journal (now Army), a private, nonprofit magazine for career soldiers. After Pearl Harbor, he enlisted and within days was told that his service was more valuable at the Journal than as an enlisted man.
Throughout the war, he received pay from both the magazine and the Army. He regularly returned the government checks.
Complete records are necessary for the entire story.
