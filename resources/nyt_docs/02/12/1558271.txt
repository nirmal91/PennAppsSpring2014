To the Editor:
''The President's Guard Service'' (editorial, Feb. 11) is at best a tempest in a teapot.
It is pure hypocrisy for the Democrats to make an issue of George W. Bush's National Guard record when they gave Bill Clinton a pass on his total avoidance of military service.
If Mr. Bush had done anything out of order, there would have been a reprimand in his National Guard records.
