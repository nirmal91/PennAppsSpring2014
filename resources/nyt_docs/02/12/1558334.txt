The Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold said yesterday that it intended to sell both its BI-LO and Bruno's supermarket chains in the southeastern United States to cut debt and recover from a $1.2 billion accounting scandal. Ahold, which wants to focus on its other chains, like Stop &amp; Shop and Giant-Landover, did not disclose a sale price or any potential buyers. Together, the two chains operate 470 stores stretching from North Carolina to Florida.
