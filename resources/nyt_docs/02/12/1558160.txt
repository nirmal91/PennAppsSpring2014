The grass is greener with these pillows, which evoke Palm Beach and are the latest from Variegated, a design studio in a restored mill building in Hudson, N.Y. Jim Deskevich and Corbett Marshall, who met at the design college at North Carolina State University, created the 2 Blade pillow (right foreground), 12 by 16 inches, $80, and the larger Clump (far right) and Clump Repeat pillows (both 18 inches square, $100). They were inspired by their passion for gardens, which they also design. Variegated makes duvet covers, shams and pillowcases, too. The pillows are linen; (518) 671-6667 or www.variegatedinc.com.
