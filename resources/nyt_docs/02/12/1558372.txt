Ricky Ray, who led the Edmonton Eskimos to the Grey Cup championship in the Canadian Football League, will visit the Jets today and could be considered a backup quarterback candidate, particularly if the Jets cannot find common ground with Vinny Testaverde.
General Manager Terry Bradway has said he wants Testaverde back as Chad Pennington's backup. Testaverde has made it clear he has no interest in being the No. 3 quarterback, and has said he would rather retire than be demoted, possibly forcing the Jets to take a huge salary-cap hit.
