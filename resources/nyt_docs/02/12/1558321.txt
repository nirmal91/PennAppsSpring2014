Members of Congress are calling for a registry of foreign tourists as a way of combating a perceived growth in the sexual abuse of children in Mexico. ''We need to diagnose the problem,'' said one congressman, Arturo Nahle Garc√≠a. The problems of ''sex tourism'' -- foreigners seeking sex with youths -- and sex trafficking in Mexico are thought to be on the increase, although few reliable statistics prove it. The federal authorities say 33 foreigners face trial in Mexico on charges of sexually abusing children.
