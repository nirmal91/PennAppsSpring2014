Mundial, a Brazilian manufacturer, once made forged knives with handles in basic black for the German knife company Henckels. For kosher kitchens, ''where you have two sets of everything,'' said Richard Zirpolo, the vice president for sales, Mundial also makes knives with white handles. But bold colors represent a decorating opportunity, since knives are often visible on the kitchen counter. Thus Mundial's 5100 Red line, left, is being test-marketed by Macy's West. Seven knives with red handles -- plus scissors, a sharpening steel and a wood storage block -- are $229.99 through Macy's at (415) 397-3333. The set will also be available starting today for $198.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2004. The Santoku knife, $50, second from left, will be available this summer with the entire range of 5100 Red knives from Mundial at www.mundialstore.com.
