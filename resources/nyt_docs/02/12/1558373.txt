The Yankees are in serious negotiations with the free-agent first baseman Travis Lee to become Jason Giambi's backup this season, but there appear to be issues that need to be resolved before the deal can be completed.
Lee batted .275 with 19 homers and 70 runs batted in for the Tampa Bay Devils Rays in 2003, and he is valued by the Yankees chiefly because he is a solid defensive player who could spell the lumbering Giambi.
General Manager Brian Cashman and Lee's agent, Scott Boras, have had lengthy discussions, but one person who has been briefed on the talks said the two sides were still haggling over financial issues. The Yankees would want Lee, who made $500,000 last season, at a modest salary. Lee declined a mutual option of $2.5 million with Tampa Bay.
If the Yankees add Lee, he would make Tony Clark, who recently signed a $750,000 deal to be Giambi's backup, expendable.
