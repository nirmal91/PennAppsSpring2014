Good penmanship has always drawn compliments. But at a new Web site where users can create a computer font based on their handwriting, those with somewhat imperfect penmanship may enjoy the most intriguing results.
Fontifier.com, which was introduced as a free service last November and quickly attracted thousands of users, was recently overhauled to improve its handwriting analysis capabilities and introduced a $9 fee per character-set ordered. The site was created by David Johnson-Davies, 49, a designer in Cambridge, England, who said he wanted to help people personalize their computer experience.
The process is simple. Print a template sheet that offers a blank square for each character. Fill it out in your handwriting and scan it. Then upload it to Fontifier's server, where software converts the handwritten characters into a fully scalable TrueType font. Then you preview your font online. If you are pleased with the results, you send a payment to Mr. Johnson-Davies's company, Human-Computer Interface, by using PayPal.
Mr. Johnson-Davies said Fontifier should work with any scanner, and he recommended trying different pens to achieve different effects. One virtue of the site was brought to his attention by a man with a sloppy hand. ''He said that our template forced him to be more careful as he wrote,'' Mr. Johnson-Davies said. ''And after using Fontifier, his wife exclaimed: 'It's amazing. I can finally read your handwriting!'''
