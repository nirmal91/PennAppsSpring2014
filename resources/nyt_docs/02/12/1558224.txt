Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the top Republican in the House, joined Democrats on Wednesday in taking issue with remarks by a White House economist that the movement of American jobs overseas could have economic and trade benefits.
In a statement, Mr. Hastert said he understood that Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, was a ''brilliant economic theorist.''
''But his theory fails a basic test of real economics,'' Mr. Hastert said. ''An economy suffers when jobs disappear.''
Democrats in Congress have seized on the White House remarks, and a group of Democratic senators called on President Bush to repudiate them.
