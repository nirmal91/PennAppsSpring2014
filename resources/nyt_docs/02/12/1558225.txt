As a career police officer, the New York City police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, knows firsthand about the anger and misinformation that can sweep through the streets when a white police officer kills a black resident. Mr. Kelly has therefore made a practice of speaking candidly to the public after each case of deadly force in an effort to defuse tension.
This policy of plain speaking sits well with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association as long as the officers in question have acted according to the rules. But the association does not like it much when Mr. Kelly finds something wrong and says so, as he did last month when he said there appeared to have been no justification for the police killing of Timothy Stansbury Jr., an unarmed teenager who was shot to death by one of two officers he encountered on a Brooklyn rooftop. The P.B.A. responded this week by calling on the commissioner to resign.
Mr. Stansbury, who was 19 years old and black, stumbled into the two officers, who are white, while following a well-traveled rooftop shortcut to a party in an adjacent building in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. One officer had his gun drawn, even though there appears to have been no apparent threat, and he may have been startled into firing when Mr. Stansbury emerged from a stairwell.
The grand jury hearing the case has yet to report its findings. But in a letter to the union released this week, Mr. Kelly stood by his earlier appraisal, describing this as a well-investigated, straightforward case. By speaking out at the time, the commissioner disarmed those who would surely have used the shooting to whip up ill will against the department. The P.B.A. should be grateful for this, and realize that the days are long gone when the department backed officers regardless of what had happened or how they had behaved.
