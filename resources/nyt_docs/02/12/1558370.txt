An advocacy group for families with low incomes released a report yesterday detailing what the group called patterns of housing discrimination on Long Island. The state may investigate. The group, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, said that suburban real estate agents were more likely to show apartments to white people than to members of minorities, and were often dismissive of black and Hispanic customers. State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, above, endorsed the findings of the report at a news conference yesterday morning. ''There is now evidence that a number of these real estate agencies have behaved in an illegal fashion and an immoral fashion,'' he said. Mr. Hevesi said he would urge the Human Rights Commission to investigate practices at the agencies the report criticized.
