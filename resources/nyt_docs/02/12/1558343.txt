The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to its highest close in more than two and a half years yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave a positive outlook for the economy.
Bond prices also rose, sending yields lower, but the dollar fell.
Stocks have not suffered a big reversal since last April, which has led some analysts to worry that the market is a little top-heavy. But the market rally stalled after all three main gauges reached post-March highs and Fed policy makers changed their language on the interest rate outlook near the end of January.
In the Fed's report to Congress yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said that the economic outlook for the year included strong growth and very low inflation and that policy makers could be patient in deciding when to begin raising interest rates.
These comments seemed to ease fears of a sooner-than-expected rate increase that were created by the statement Fed officials released after their meeting on Jan. 28. As a result, stocks and bonds rose yesterday.
In addition, the Fed's prediction this year for economic growth of around 5 percent, strong productivity and restraint on interest rates were all positive for stocks, because they can translate to good corporate earnings.
But the restraint on interest rates did not help the dollar, which has dropped 11.8 percent against major currencies in the last 12 months and, because interest rates in the United States are so low, remains a relatively unattractive investment.
The Dow climbed 123.85 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,737.70 yesterday, its best close since June 2001, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,157.76, its highest close since March 2002. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.33, or 0.7 percent, to 2,089.66. It is still below its Jan. 26 close, which was the highest since June 2001. Since last year's rally began, the Dow has risen 42.7 percent, the Nasdaq 64.3 percent and the S.&amp;P. 44.6 percent.
In the bond market, the price on the Treasury's 10-year note rose 21/32, to 101 24/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.03 percent, from 4.11 percent Tuesday. In the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell 0.8 percent, to 1.2809 euros, from 1.2710 Tuesday.
In the statement after the Jan. 28 meeting, the Fed dropped language that said interest could be kept low for a ''considerable period.''
It was replaced with ''the committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation,'' a reference to raising interest rates. This change seemed to indicate that a rate increase would be coming sooner than had been expected.
But yesterday, ''Mr. Greenspan fleshed out what patient means,'' said Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates.
''It is not as long as 'considerable period,''' Mr. Liro said, ''but a lot longer than people thought after Jan. 28.''
While Mr. Greenspan was optimistic, he warned that failure to reduce the federal budget deficit, which the Bush administration forecasts at $521 billion this year, could lead to ''an appreciable backup'' in longer-term interest rates ''in the relatively near term.''
But he said it would not be a significant problem for the Treasury market if foreign central banks began selling the large amount of Treasury securities they now own.
Many central banks, including those in Japan and South Korea, own billions in Treasury securities. This is because they have sold their home currencies to buy dollars in an effort to keep their currencies from rising against the dollar and hurting their countries' export business.
David J. Greenlaw, chief United State fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley, called this comment a ''stretch.'' Because foreign central banks own more than 25 percent of outstanding Treasuries, he said, ''it would be very hard to find a Treasury trader who would buy into Greenspan's notion that heavy foreign central bank selling would not have a material impact on yields.''
