The 163rd season of the New York Philharmonic will begin on Sept. 21 when Lorin Maazel leads the orchestra in Beethoven's Violin Concerto, featuring Maxim Vengerov, and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9, ''From the New World,'' a work given its premiere by the Philharmonic in 1893.
The performance by the 106-member ensemble at a gala concert at Avery Fisher Hall will usher in a season of 113 subscription concerts over 32 weeks, the orchestra has announced. Among the highlights are three world premieres commissioned by the Philharmonic from Augusta Read Thomas, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Wolfgang Rihm; two United States premieres; and nine New York premieres.
In his third season as the orchestra's music director, Mr. Maazel will conduct 12 subscription weeks comprising 45 concerts. On March 1, 2005, the orchestra will celebrate his 75th birthday with a performance of five of his compositions in a concert featuring the cellist Han-Na Chang, the flutist James Galway, the German actress Dietlinde Turban (Mr. Maazel's wife), the Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.
From March 17, 2005, through April 16, the orchestra will present a New York Philharmonic Festival: Visions of the Beyond, an exploration of music used by composers like Mendelssohn, Bach, Messiaen, Berlioz and Sibelius to illuminate and evoke aspects of existence beyond human mortality.
Away from its home at Avery Fisher Hall, the Philharmonic will perform at Riverside Church, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine and in the Time Warner Concerts in the Parks. It will also go on tours to the Midwest, Japan and South Korea, play at festivals in Germany and Switzerland and have a two-week residency at the Bravo! Vail Valley Music Festival in Colorado.
