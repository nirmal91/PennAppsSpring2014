St. John's has suspended center Abe Keita for his role in the team's recent scandal. The university, which sought his expulsion, will not appeal the decision of its judicial panel, a university spokeswoman, Jody Fisher, said yesterday.
Keita, a graduate student who is a senior in athletic eligibility, has been removed from the team and will be allowed to resume his studies in a year.
In addition to Keita, disciplinary action has been completed for Elijah Ingram, who withdrew from the university, and Grady Reynolds, who was expelled. All were starters.
They were among the players who went to a strip club outside Pittsburgh after a game last Wednesday night. A woman they met at the club accused them of rape. She was later charged with false reports to law enforcement, prostitution and criminal theft by extortion, all misdemeanors.
COLLEGE BASKETBALL  Correction:  February 16, 2004, Monday  Because of an editing error, a sports article on Thursday about the suspension of a St. John's University basketball player, Abe Keita, referred incorrectly to a university press officer who reported on the action. The press officer, Jody Fisher, is a man.
