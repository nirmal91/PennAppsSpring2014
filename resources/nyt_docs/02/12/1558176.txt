At the Interior Design Show running today through Sunday in Toronto, Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe, both architects (right), will unveil their HAB line of tables, chairs and lights. Ms. Shim and Mr. Sutcliffe, who work in Toronto, say their molded plywood HAB Chair (top, with maple finish) is a modern interpretation of a rustic cabin classic like the Adirondack chair. ''The wide arms help you deal with a magazine, a gin and tonic or a laptop,'' Ms. Shim said. The chair is priced at $1,950. Painted prototypes of a metal version will be on view at the show, at the National Trade Center at Exhibition Place.
A 42-inch-square coffee table (top) with stainless steel legs and tension cables is $1,300. A 24-inch-square side table is $1,100. The tables and chairs can be ordered from Nienk√§mper, (800) 668-9318 or www.nienkamper.com; delivery, 10 to 12 weeks. The line will be in New York in March at the ICF Group showroom, 920 Broadway (20th Street); (212) 388-1000.
The HAB Bug Lamp (left) is based on a custom fixture the team designed for a boathouse on Lake Muskoka in Ontario. The new version is made of laboratory glass on a stainless-steel base. Flexible wires inside support resin discs coated with phosphorescent powder that glows for up to 90 minutes after the 75-watt bulb is turned off, for an effect like fireflies in a jar. The lamp will be available direct from HAB in three heights -- 12, 26 1/2 and 32 inches -- with a delivery time of about six weeks. Prices will start at $1,200. Information and orders: www.hab.ca.
