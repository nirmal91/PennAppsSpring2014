Former President Bill Clinton's office in Harlem is expanding to Brooklyn and the Bronx a program that has helped small businesses in the neighborhood.
Officials in his office said the program, which started out by giving advice on accounting, marketing and computer skills to 10 small businesses in Harlem, would grow to include up to 20 more small businesses in the city in the next few months.
''When the president moved up to Harlem, he was well aware that small businesses were being forced out of the community,'' said Clyde Williams, the chief domestic policy adviser in Mr. Clinton's office on 125th Street. ''Now we want to bring this same program to other boroughs in the city that need help.''
The program, originally called the Harlem Small Business Initiative, was created in the spring of 2002. It provided more than 44,000 hours of free consulting time and nearly $20,000 in donations to 10 Harlem businesses, including a florist, a plumber, a dental practice, a yoga studio and a greeting card shop.
Booz Allen Hamilton, the management consulting firm, was brought in to teach the businesses how to market their products and services and to control their inventories, Mr. Williams said. The National Black MBA Association helped the businesses improve their bookkeeping and accounting skills.
The program also received donations of computers from the National Association of Minorities in Communications. Students from the Stern School of Business at New York University volunteered by helping with everything from dealing with customers to writing business plans, Mr. Williams said.
''Before I was introduced to them, my business operated like it was 1960,'' said Ken Taylor, 39, a Harlem plumber. ''After I got on board, I learned how do things like they do it in the new millennium.''
Mr. Taylor said, for example, that he learned how to use a computer, was persuaded to hire an office manager and was helped to build a customer database of a few hundred names.
