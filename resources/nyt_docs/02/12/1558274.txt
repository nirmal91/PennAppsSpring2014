To the Editor:
For many reasons, the failure of the White House to present anyone who recalls serving with George W. Bush in the Alabama National Guard in 1972 seems to demonstrate that he did not participate as he claims (front page, Feb. 11).
The unit was not a semi-anonymous infantry unit but rather a select unit. A supervisor, colleague or ground crew would certainly have remembered a pilot who trained for six months, as Mr. Bush claims.
This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Mr. Bush became president.
Former colleagues would have every incentive to recall having trained with a future president.
Finally, from 1971-72 George W. Bush's father, George H. W. Bush, was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, holding a highly visible position. As the son of such a prominent individual, a pilot in a military reserve unit could hardly have escaped anonymity.
