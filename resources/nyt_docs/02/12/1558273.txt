To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released'' (front page, Feb. 11):
My husband and I were both naval reservists in a long-ago life. We were also people who opposed the war in Vietnam in all the ways open to us, and we never denigrated those who served in that war.
We did our best to assist young men to find ways not to go to the war -- as a matter of conscience -- as did many other Americans, especially politically liberal ones.
I find it odd now that the issue of how an American young man found an honorable way to serve in those tumultuous times is under such scrutiny by those of the very same political thinking who understood that Bill Clinton, the former president, as well as many others, found ways to avoid military service in what was deemed a ''bad war.''
Is this not talking out of both sides of one's mouth?
The American people rightly put aside the bitterness of the issue of Vietnam non-service once and for all.
President Bush did serve, and his training put him in a position to be called up.
