Olympus, a company primarily known for its cameras, is taking its optical knowledge and making a leap to the big screen with its first projector. The petite VP-1 Data Projector has a Zuiko digital zoom lens, similar to the one Olympus uses for its camera line. With 1,000 ANSI lumens of brightness and a contrast ratio of 2,000:1 -- the highest of any similarly sized projector -- the VP-1 will make those PowerPoint presentations sharp and clear. It even magnifies the projected picture up to 10 times for those who want to zero in on a specific detail.
The projector uses the Digital Light Processing (D.L.P.) technology developed by Texas Instruments, and it comes with a picture-in-picture feature that can display two images at once. For connecting the projector to computers, DVD players and other video sources, the VP-1 has a variety of ports, including S-video, VGA, component video, composite video, and Digital Video Interface.
The projector is to reach stores next month with an estimated price of $2,000; further details are at www.olympusamerica.com. Tipping the scales at a mere 2.4 pounds, it makes the chore of lugging equipment to a presentation much less of an upper-body workout than it used to be.
