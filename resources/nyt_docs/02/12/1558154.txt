For Valentine's Day, can there be too much love? The artist Robert Indiana first put ''LOVE'' on a 1964 Christmas card. He made Love sculptures and prints, and the design was used on a 1973 stamp. Now the Rug Company has introduced a $1,295 needlepoint wall hanging, left, by Sir Paul Smith, the English haberdasher, that suggests Mr. Indiana's work, down to the tilted ''O'' (although the tilt is left instead of right).
The Rug Company says there is no link. ''The only similarity between Paul Smith's wall hanging and Robert Indiana's work is the ability to produce great design inspired by the fantastic human emotion that is love,'' said Alex Conway, a spokeswoman. Sir Paul also added things like snowflakes. The Rug Company is at 88 Wooster Street (Spring Street); (212) 274-0444 or www.therugcompany.info.
