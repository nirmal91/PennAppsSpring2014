President Chandrika Kumaratunga dismissed 39 junior ministers allied with her rival, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Ms. Kumaratunga dissolved Parliament on Saturday and ordered new elections for April 2. The latest move was seen as an effort to prevent Mr. Wickremesinghe's party from having an advantage in the election because of access to government resources.
