The state attorney general, Bill Pryor, sued the sewer board of Prichard, an industrial suburb of Mobile, over a huge spill in which a ruptured main sent millions of gallons of raw sewage into a creek that empties into Mobile Bay. The suit, in Mobile County Circuit Court, requests that the court appoint a supervisor to take charge of the board's daily operations.
