'The Gruffalo'  New Victory Theater
Over the years mid-Manhattan has attracted many a monstrous creature. King Kong has visited. Godzilla, too. And now (shudder) comes the gruffalo.
Yes, the selfsame creature with ''terrible tusks and terrible claws and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws'' that has captivated readers in the prizewinning children's book ''The Gruffalo,'' written in rhyme by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.
Till Feb. 22 the gruffalo and ''The Gruffalo'' are roaming the New Victory Theater in Times Square in an altogether winning hourlong, intermissionless performance by the Tall Stories Theater Company of London.
Recommended for ages 4 and up, this colorful, tuneful adaptation of the tale of a clever mouse outwitting predators in a deep, dark wood goes beyond the book in admirable ways, not least the enlistment of the audience in the proceedings.
For the uninitiated, the gruffalo is a creature invented by a bright little mouse to scare off sly predators: a glib fox, an owl like a relic of the old Royal Flying Corps, and a maraca-shaking Latinate snake. When these hungry fellows invite the mouse to their respective lairs, the mouse declines on the grounds that it is meeting the gruffalo. What's a gruffalo? It's a fearsome creature that the mouse is only too happy to describe, sending the fox, the owl and the snake scurrying away.
And what should the mouse encounter next? Why, a gruffalo, of course, a hungry one.
There's nothing else to do but convince this beast that the mouse is the scariest creature in the woods.
Under the direction of Olivia Jacobs, Michaela O'Connor as the perky, plucky mouse; Sean Kempton as each of the predators; and Derek Elroy as that humorous hulk the gruffalo turn in spirit-raising performances.
If only someone could bottle this stuff.
