To the Editor:
As a pastor, I am appalled by the Rev. Henry Wasielewski's admission that he tells people at funerals, ''If anyone's going to grieve, we'd like them to leave right now'' (''Funerals With a Custom Fit Lighten Up a Solemn Rite,'' news article, Feb. 11).
As Christians, we indeed look to the Resurrection as our hope in times of loss.
There is cause for celebration in the promise of life eternal. But a funeral is also the beginning of healing from loss.
Grief is not a sign of inadequate faith in the promise of salvation but rather a very human reaction to the loss of the presence and companionship of a loved one right here, right now.
(Rev.) ANNE-MARIE HISLOP  Davenport, Iowa, Feb. 11, 2004
