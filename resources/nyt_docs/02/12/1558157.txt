If you want a racy new shape, you could hire Pininfarina, the designer of the Ferrari. Pininfarina styled the chassis of the 3M Digital Projector S10, below. An optional ceiling mount allows a white wall (or even better, a screen) to be turned into a mural-size television. (Set the projector 20 feet back, and the image is 10 feet tall.) The projector comes with a remote control and weighs less than seven pounds; it is HDTV-ready, and can be connected to a computer. It costs $1,049 at the B&amp;H Photo-Video Web site, www.bhphotovideo.com. Information: (800) 328-1371 or www.3m.com/meetings.
