When James L. Dolan, the chairman of Madison Square Garden, first talked before the season about the Knicks making the playoffs, character was his guiding principle and his explanation for trading Latrell Sprewell.
With Isiah Thomas guiding the Knicks as president of basketball operations, the team has a winning record over the past month and Dolan believes the Knicks could contend for a championship this season.
In saying that he is ''comfortable with every move that Mr. Thomas has made,'' Dolan made it clear that Thomas is now the one determining character.
Before the Knicks' game against the Hornets on Wednesday, Dolan said he approved of Thomas's pursuit of players with questionable behavior or previous legal trouble like Rasheed Wallace, Eddie Griffin or Leon Smith.
''Would I sign off on anybody?'' Dolan said. ''I'm trying to think what the worst case would be. You know what? I would sign off on any player he would bring in.
''I don't think Isiah would bring on someone who he thought would be detrimental to the character of the team. When you looked at Stephon's reputation, I don't think Stephon deserved that reputation, and I think he's proven that, at least proven that to me, the fans and the other players.''
Dolan, who said that the previous coach, Don Chaney, had not returned his phone calls, was thrilled with the Knicks' turnaround.
''I think we're going to the playoffs, and my hope is that I would like to see us go all the way,'' Dolan said. ''I think this team could.''
