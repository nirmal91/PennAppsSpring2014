In 1995, Dave Salo, a leading coach from Irvine, Calif., took his new swimmer, Amanda Beard, to the United States spring national championships in Minneapolis.
''She just made the final of the 200-meter breaststroke,'' Salo recalled Wednesday. ''Before we went back to the pool for the final, I told her that with 70 meters to go she had to pick up her turnover rate and bring it home. When we got to the pool, I showed her exactly where 70 meters was. She was swimming maybe last in the race, but at exactly 70 meters to go she switched gears and got up to third. At that point, I knew I had someone who listened, someone who liked to race. And she was only 13 years old.''
At 14, in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Beard won a gold medal and two silvers. In the 2000 Olympics, she won a bronze. She is now on course for three more Olympic medals.
She is competing here at the Y.M.C.A. Aquatic Center's 50-meter pool in the ConocoPhillips five-day spring nationals. On Wednesday, she won the women's 200-meter breaststroke by five meters in 2 minutes 24.97 seconds. She is favored in the 100-meter breaststroke on Friday.
Beard looked back in amusement at her early career.
''In the Olympics in Atlanta, some teammates treated me as a little girl, some like an equal,'' she said. ''I wanted them to treat me as a teammate and not a little sister or someone they were going to baby-sit.''
Some teammates stayed in the Olympic Village and went to movies and concerts with her and kept an eye on her. Jack Nelson, who coached the United States Olympic women in 1976, said the same was done when his team included 14-year-old Jill Sterkel.
''I had some older teammates looking after me,'' Beard said. ''Jeremy Lynn, Janet Evans, Scott Tucker. When the others were partying, we would hang out in the village. I never really went out with them because I knew someone would have to leave early and bring me back.
''But looking back, I think it was real good for me to be successful so young. At that age, you don't understand the real meaning of the Olympics and how intense they were.''
In the world championships in Barcelona, Spain, last July, Beard, who had grown to 5 feet 8 inches and 120 pounds, swam her fastest yet. She won the 200-meter breaststroke and tied the world record of 2:22.29.
Now, at age 22, she lives and trains in Tucson, and is working toward a degree in retail and consumer sciences at the University of Arizona.
''I think I grew up pretty fast, and actually, growing up was pretty easy,'' she said. ''I think I enjoy swimming a lot more. I don't feel pressure to do it. If you have that, you just crumble. It's my job. How many people do their jobs and love it and don't dread it?''
