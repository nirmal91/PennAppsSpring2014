A student at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn was arrested yesterday after pointing a loaded 9-millimeter handgun at another student on the school's outside stairs, the police said. The police said that the student, 15, whose name was not released because of his age, was charged with menacing and gun possession. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said that disciplinary action was pending. In another case, the police said a 13-year-old student at Intermediate School 25, also in Brooklyn, took a .38-caliber gun into school and was charged on Tuesday with gun possession.
