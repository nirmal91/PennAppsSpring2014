To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released'' (front page, Feb. 11):
The administration has produced what it says is proof that President Bush fulfilled his military obligation. But the records tell only part of the story.
They show that during his time in the National Guard, Mr. Bush blew off his regular, required service when it suited him but left himself enough time to make up for service missed to qualify for his early release from the military.
Mr. Bush used his privilege to gain admission to the National Guard, gave back minimal service in exchange, and manipulated the system to procure preference before his honorable discharge.
The supporters of President Bush proclaim that because of his moral character and strong leadership, he deserves re-election. Mr. Bush's military record in no way supports such assertions.
