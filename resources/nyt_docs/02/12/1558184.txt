To the Editor:
Re ''Misspending Military Dollars'' (editorial, Feb. 5):
Regarding the president's fiscal year 2005 defense budget, it is impossible to predict the demands on our military resources subsequent to the transfer of sovereignty in Iraq scheduled for July 1 and the coming presidential elections in Afghanistan.
While you acknowledge our expenditures on unmanned aerial vehicles, you do not mention our financing for other transformational programs, notably, the conversion of cold-war Trident submarines into cruise missile carriers and the development of laser communications satellites and radio systems based on Internet communications.
The F-18 and F-22 are the only tactical combat aircraft currently in production for the Navy and the Air Force, respectively, while the F-35 continues to elicit the strong support of the many foreign governments contributing to its development.
Finally, you did not mention the $27 billion of the budget allocated solely to finance congressionally mandated, expanding health-care-related costs, of which more than $10 billion is purely to cover future costs of medical-related retirement benefits.
