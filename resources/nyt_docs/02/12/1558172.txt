First electronics companies conquered portability, putting machines that once had to be wheeled around on dollies into the palm of your hand. Now they have tackled functionality, making once-limited portable technologies versatile as well.
The RCA Lyra Audio/Video Jukebox 2780 from Thomson is a digital media all-in-one: video player-recorder, music player, portable hard drive and digital photo album.
The device has audio-video inputs and outputs and a U.S.B. 2.0 port to allow connections to a PC, stereo system or television. The 20 gigabytes of hard disk space translates into 100,000 pictures, as much as 80 hours of recorded or downloaded video, or 5,000 songs. With a 3.5-inch color liquid-crystal display, the Lyra, which can be found online for $400 or less, is smaller than a VHS tape.
Challenging rivals that beat it to the market, the Lyra has a built-in reader for your digital camera's CompactFlash memory card and a slide-show mode that enables you to present pictures accompanied by an audio soundtrack.
There is even a kickstand, so you won't actually have to hold your hand-held while you use it.
