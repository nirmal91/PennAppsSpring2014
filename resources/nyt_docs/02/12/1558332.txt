WorldCom said yesterday that it had asked the United States Bankruptcy Court in New York for a 60-day extension of the Feb. 28 deadline for completing its reorganization. WorldCom said that it needed more time to complete filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that restate its earnings and revenues for 2002 and 2003. The final accounting of the impact of the $11 billion accounting fraud that plunged the company into bankruptcy in 2002 is the last step in the reorganization. WorldCom, based in Ashburn, Va., plans to change its name to MCI when it emerges from bankruptcy. Stock in the new company, which began trading over the counter in November on a when-issued basis at $26.70 a share, fell 25 cents yesterday, to $23.50.
