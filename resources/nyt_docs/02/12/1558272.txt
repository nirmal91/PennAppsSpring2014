To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released'' (front page, Feb. 11):
A friend of mine and I recently discovered that we have something in common with President Bush. In 1968 we all avoided the draft and military service in Vietnam.
I received a teacher's deferment. My friend, like Mr. Bush, joined the National Guard.
Unlike the National Guard today, there was little chance then that a Guard unit would be called to active duty. Everyone knew this.
The big difference between us and George W. Bush is that we are quite willing to admit that we had no desire to go to Vietnam and risk getting killed.
Come on, George. 'Fess up. John Kerry is a war hero, but like us, you're just another guy who successfully avoided the draft.
