A child died in a New Jersey hospital on Jan. 31, after a resident connected the child's oxygen tubing and intravenous tubing, lines that should not have been compatible, a hospital spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman added that the child's family did not want details of the death to be made public. The hospital, Morristown Memorial, said in a statement on Monday that it had been conducting an investigation into the death, which it had immediately reported to state authorities. It did not disclose the name of the child or the resident. The death was first reported in The Star-Ledger.
