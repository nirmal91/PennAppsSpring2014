The news director of the state-owned television network France 2, Olivier Mazerolle, left, stepped down after a rare vote of no confidence by its journalists. On Feb. 3 the network's evening newscast wrongly announced the departure of former Prime Minister Alain Juppé from politics after his conviction on corruption charges. At the same time, Mr. Juppé was giving an interview on a rival station in which he said he planned to wait for a decision while his conviction was appealed.
