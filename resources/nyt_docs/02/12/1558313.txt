Magazine advertising began on a down note in 2004 as ad pages declined in January for an eighth consecutive month, according to information released by the Publishers Information Bureau in New York.
Ad pages fell 0.3 percent in January compared with the month a year earlier as pages fell in 5 of 12 major categories. The largest increase was in public transportation, hotels and resorts, with a gain of 21.1 percent, and the greatest decline came in technology, with a 16.8 percent drop.
