A beachfront cabana recently sold in South Beach for $850,000. That's $3,148 a square foot -- four and half times the average for Manhattan apartments. It is one of 14 next to the Continuum, a condominium tower at the southern tip of Miami Beach. Each cabana is 270 square feet and has a kitchen, a bathroom and a porch.
The developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, plans to build another tower and 14 more cabanas, starting at $1 million. ''If they've spent $2 million on their apartment, the last thing they want to do is walk with their bathing suit through the lobby and track sand into their apartment,'' he said. Charles Sieger, the architect, said the porches will project over a lagoon. ''It's almost Bermuda goes Zen,'' he said. Sales: (305) 695-1111.
