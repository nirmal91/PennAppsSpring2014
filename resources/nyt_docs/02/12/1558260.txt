The political farce of the brief disappearance of the candidate Ivan Rybkin may well prove to be the only excitement in the greater tragicomedy of the Russian presidential election. One of a handful of utterly hopeless challengers to Vladimir Putin, Mr. Rybkin came home with a bag of fruit last Thursday, draped his jacket over a chair, sent his driver and bodyguard away, turned off his cellphone and vanished. His wife finally called the police over the weekend, setting off wild speculation that he had been assassinated by ''the organs.'' A sheepish Mr. Rybkin reappeared on Tuesday, with the lame explanation that he had taken a few days off in Kiev. Uh-huh, said his wife, Albina, before delivering the coup de gr√¢ce: ''I feel sorry for Russia if people like this want to govern it.'' Mr. Rybkin never registered more than a blip in the polls. But the effect of his political demise was to underscore the lack of serious opposition to President Putin.
Mr. Putin is not entirely to blame for his country's lopsided politics. He has amassed extraordinary popularity by having pensions paid on time, stabilizing the ruble and looking after Russia's national interests. But Mr. Putin has used this power to constrain democracy rather than extend it. He has brought the nation's broadcasters back under the Kremlin's control, waged a crude campaign to crush a politically ambitious oil baron and brooked no criticism of Russia's brutal policies in Chechnya. None of those steps are tantamount to fixing elections, but they must have played a role in keeping genuine opponents out of the presidential race.
We hope that the fallout from Mr. Rybkin's lost weekend will make Mr. Putin understand that he gains little from running against nonentities, and that the authority acquired from an honest win over a respectable challenger would be greater than the power gleaned from getting all the votes.
