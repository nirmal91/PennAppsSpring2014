To the Editor:
Geneva Overholser, my friend and successor as editor of The Des Moines Register, seems to have forgotten that the First Amendment is there to protect the outrageous and the outspoken and the outlandish, as well as nice people like her (''The Journalist and the Whistle-Blower,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 6). She thinks that the syndicated columnist Robert Novak has acted outlandishly and thus should have to reveal a confidential source.
A promise made is a promise that should be kept. To some of us, those who would ignore that basic tenet of journalism are the ones who are acting outlandishly -- though of course we defend their right to express their misguided views.
