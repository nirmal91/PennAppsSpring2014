The medical education establishment suffered a setback when a federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit contending that medical residents are forced to participate in a system that ensures that they work long hours for low pay. The judge, Paul L. Friedman of United States District Court, rejected pleas by medical schools and teaching hospitals that he dismiss the suit. It argues that a system known as the match, which pairs medical school graduates with hospitals for training, is a violation of antitrust laws.
