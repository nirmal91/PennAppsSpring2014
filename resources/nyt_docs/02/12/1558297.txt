A federal district judge in Wyoming late Tuesday allowed the National Park Service to raise the current cap on the number of snowmobiles allowed in Yellowstone National Park.
The order, which effectively nullified an earlier ruling by another federal judge, told the Park Service to establish ''fair and equitable'' rules for snowmobile use in the remaining month of the winter season.
The new ruling, by Judge Clarence A. Brimmer, included pointed rebuttals to the earlier decision, which was issued in mid-December by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court in Washington.
Judge Sullivan had overturned a decision by the Bush administration, made final only days before the Dec. 17 start of snowmobile season, that rescinded the Clinton administration's environmental plan for a snowmobile phaseout in the park.
In his order Tuesday, Judge Brimmer said, ''A single Eastern district judge shouldn't have the unlimited power to impose'' the old rule ''on the public and the business community, any more than a single Western district judge should have the power to opt for a different rule.'' Rather, he said, ''these issues should be left in the care'' of the Park Service.
