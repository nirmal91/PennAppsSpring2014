Explanatory text yesterday about the method used for exit polls in the Virginia and Tennessee primaries described the one in Tennessee incorrectly. A total of 2,489 voters were interviewed there, 961 of them as they left early-voting locations in 21 counties between Jan. 31 and Feb. 5. There were no telephone interviews.
