To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released'' (front page, Feb. 11):
It seems beside the point to argue over whether George W. Bush showed up for Guard duty 30 years ago. My question is, What was a fighter like him doing in a Stateside unit in the first place?
If he had served in his own generation's unnecessary war, he might not have been so easily led into starting one for this generation.
