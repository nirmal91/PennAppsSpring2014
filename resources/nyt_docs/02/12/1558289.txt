Momma Rose ain't ready to go just yet. Encouraged by an uptick in sales and some improved weather, the producers of the Broadway revival of ''Gypsy'' announced yesterday that they would cancel their planned closing on Feb. 28 at the Shubert Theater and try to extend the show's run as long as possible. The $8-million production, which stars Bernadette Peters, above, as Gypsy Rose Lee's stubborn stage mother, had been posting large weekly losses during a frigid January but grossed nearly $425,000 last week, an improvement of some $65,000 from the week before. The show also got a burst of unexpected publicity when Laura Bush took in a performance last weekend.
