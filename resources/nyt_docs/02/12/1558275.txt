To the Editor:
Re ''The President's Guard Service'' (editorial, Feb. 11):
You correctly point out that there are some unanswered questions about exactly when the president fulfilled his National Guard duties.
In light of the fact that he was honorably discharged, and thus ultimately completed the requisite number of hours of service, perhaps we should jump ahead 30 years and commend the president for being such a strong leader in the perilous times that our country is facing, rather than dwell on the past.
