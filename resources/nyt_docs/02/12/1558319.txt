With New York's second-largest city struggling under immense annual deficits, the leader of the county that surrounds it called on Wednesday for consolidating his government with that of the City of Buffalo.
During his State of the County address, Erie County's executive, Joel A. Giambra. said the entity would be called ''New Greater Buffalo.''
''After 200 years of governing separately, it's time to get our act together and it's time to bring our governments together,'' Mr. Giambra said.
Buffalo's mounting annual deficits, projected to reach $110 million by 2007, led state leaders to impose a fiscal control board last year to oversee the city's finances, intensifying running debates over duplication of services between the city and county and over revenue sharing.
Mr. Giambra sits on the nine-member panel along with Mayor Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo.
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said of the plan, ''While we need to look at the details, we think it has potential.''
Mr. Masiello said he supported the idea, even if it eliminated his job.
