To the Editor:
While I don't agree with Thomas L. Friedman's support of the war in Iraq, he is absolutely correct in his assessment that ''the whole burden is being borne by a small cadre of Americans -- the soldiers, their families and reservists -- and the rest of us are just sailing along, as if it has nothing to do with us'' (''The Home Team,'' column, Feb. 8).
We are at war! Since when have Americans become so self-centered, uncaring and uninvolved in wartime? Where is the grief and the outcry over 530 deaths and over 3,000 wounded and maimed in this senseless war in Iraq? When will Americans wake up, feel the pain and make President Bush accountable? Or have we truly become the callous nation that our enemies despise?
