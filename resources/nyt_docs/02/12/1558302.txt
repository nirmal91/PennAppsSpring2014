The pay television network British Sky Broadcasting said that it would pay investors a dividend for the first time in five years. The company, which is 35 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, angered investors in 2003 when it hired Mr. Murdoch's son James as chief executive. Investors were worried at that time that the strong cash flow from BSkyB would be diverted from their pockets. BSkyB will pay an interim dividend of 2.75 pence a share, the company said. BSkyB also said that net profit for the last six months of 2003 was £130 million ($245 million), up from £12 million a year ago.
