'Promised Land'  American Theater of Actors
From the character descriptions, Harvey Huddleston's new play, ''Promised Land,'' sounds promising. E. L. Sullins is an Arkansas real estate developer who was blinded eight years ago in a farming accident in which his young son was killed. His wife, Robby, is trying to coax him out of depression and denial by getting him to visit their son's grave. Charley Parker is a young man from St. Louis who moved to the Ozarks to buy a cabin, but now wants back $2,000 he gave E. L. so he can marry Betty Sweeney, a high school senior who just wants to get away from her redneck daddy.
Unfortunately E. L. turns out to be a bore and Robby a nag. The play really goes nowhere, and watching the Red Earth Ensemble production at the American Theater of Actors on West 54th Street in Manhattan is like watching a dog chase its tail for nearly two and a half hours.
Mr. Huddleston works hard trying to bring these two-dimensional characters to life. E. L. for example listens to ''Moby-Dick'' on a vintage tape recorder and talks a lot about Ishmael and the elusive white whale. White elephant is more like it. But no one has much to say, and the dialogue is larded with dull anecdotes and Dogpatch aphorisms.
Mr. Huddleston's text is not the only problem. Under Tom Dybek's direction, the blocking is awkward and the pacing hesitant. David Mazzeo brings some energy to the stage as E. L., and Lynne McCollough makes the most of two scenes in which Robby tries to persuade him to visit the grave, but she spends a lot of the play pouring coffee for the men. The only consistently credible performance is from Bruce McKinnon as the local sheriff, who drops in from time to time.
