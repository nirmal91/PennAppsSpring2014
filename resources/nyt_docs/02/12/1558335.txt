The City of Houston faces a $150 million budget shortfall in the fiscal year beginning July 1, said Mayor Bill White, describing the projected deficit as more than double the estimated level. Mr. White, who took office last month, said layoffs and sales of city-owned land were being considered to close the deficit.
