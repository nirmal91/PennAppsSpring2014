A picture caption on Jan. 15 with an article about the federal commission investigating the Sept. 11 terror attacks misidentified a commission member. (The commission has pointed out that the same error occurred last April 2.) The member is Chris Kojm, deputy executive director, not Philip Zelikow, the executive director.
