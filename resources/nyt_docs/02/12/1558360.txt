An article on Sunday about the policies of New York City's Human Resources Administration under Commissioner Verna Eggleston referred imprecisely to the advisory role of Alan B. Siskind, chairman of the Human Services Council of New York City. When he said he advises the agency, he meant as a member of its Citizens Advisory Committee, not in his capacity with the council. Although the council also offers advice, it is a nonprofit association of social service agencies and not primarily an advisory group to the commissioner.
