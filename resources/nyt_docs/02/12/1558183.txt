Re ''The Hard Way to Learn That the Internet Is Not Disneyland,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Feb. 8):
Computer security experts know that employee education is the ''make or break'' factor in protecting corporate digital property. This same lesson must now be applied to society. Where to start? Kids.
Young people, the largest segment of Internet users, know more about computing than adults do. But they need instruction on how to use computers and the Internet securely, effectively and responsibly. And many of these young people will enter the high-tech-enabled work force during this decade.
There needs to be a national commitment to teach cyber-skills to young people to build the social foundation and culture of secure, responsible computing in the 21st century.
