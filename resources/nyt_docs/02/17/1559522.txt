To the Editor:
I take issue with your Feb. 5 Arts pages article ''Cash Flow Plagues Ballet Theater.'' You compare Ballet Theater's financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003, focusing on a decline in cash.
Those statements also show a $2.5 million increase in pledges and receivables. The pledges and receivables have since been substantially received in cash, largely offsetting the cash decline.
Ballet Theater's operations are seasonal in nature; there is significant income to be realized over the next eight months from ticket sales and donor gifts.
Last year, Ballet Theater raised more money than ever before in its history, and its endowment increased by more than a third.
