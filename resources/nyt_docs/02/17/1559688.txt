Blacks are underrepresented in management positions in city government, according to a study of eight city agencies that was released yesterday. The study, conducted by Blacks in Government, a group that advocates a more diverse city work force, found that blacks held 35 percent of the jobs at the Department of Buildings, for example, but just 6 percent of its managerial positions. A spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Jordan Barowitz, said the group had selected the eight agencies ''to fulfill preconceived conclusions.''
