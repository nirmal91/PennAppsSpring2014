To the Editor:
Re ''Senators Try to Squeeze Slimmer Energy Bill Through Congress After Defeat Last Year'' (news article, Feb. 11): A rational energy future must involve greater energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources, so it is bizarre that Senate Republicans are proposing a bill that still includes large ''incentives'' and tax breaks for the oil, coal, gas and nuclear industries.
When industries' true costs are covered by tax dollars, the real costs are hidden behind artificially lowered prices for consumers. New and innovative industries are forced to swim upstream against these subsidies, blocking progress toward a sensible, cleaner energy future and driving us to ever greater dependency on Middle East oil.
When we fill up at the pump, part of the cost of that gasoline will be paid by future generations. It's a strange policy for an administration that claims to favor free markets.
