To the Editor:
''Cuba Detentions May Last Years'' (front page, Feb. 13) is troubling.
The Pentagon official's defense about a soldier's right not to have to face ''these people'' in combat seems to completely ignore the detainee's rights. I don't like to endanger our troops by releasing our enemies, but I also don't like to endanger the values expressed in our Constitution.
If Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has reason to believe that the Guantnamo detainees are guilty, then it follows that there must be ample evidence with which to try these people.
We ought not indiscriminately release captives in Cuba. There should be lawyers. And trials. And our most fundamental liberties.
