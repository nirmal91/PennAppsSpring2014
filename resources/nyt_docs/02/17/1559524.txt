To the Editor:
As I approach my 67th birthday, I have been in the Medicare program (letter, Feb. 10) for almost two years. It works beautifully for me.
We can gradually approach health insurance for all by lowering eligibility for Medicare to age 60 now, and lowering it by five years every five years. This will enable the economy and the insurance industry to adjust in a relatively non-disruptive way.
While this will take a couple of generations for everyone to be covered, we have been rejecting all-or-nothing approaches since at least the Truman administration.
Yes, expanding Medicare will cause government spending to rise, but total spending on medical care and medical care insurance will be substantially less since Medicare's overhead is a lot less than that of private health insurance.
