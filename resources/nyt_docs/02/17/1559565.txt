The American ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said Monday that government and international officials were still working to hold both presidential and parliamentary elections in Afghanistan in June or shortly after.
''There is a way for this to happen,'' he said. ''I am optimistic that this will be the case. I have argued that there are ways to compensate for the slow start.''
He said it was premature to talk of postponement at this stage, since the effort to accelerate registration and organization for elections had not yet started. He was responding to a report on Monday in The New York Times that said the Bush administration had begun suggesting that the elections may have to be postponed because of security problems and the failure to register enough voters.
''We have not gone through the exercise to its conclusion yet,'' he said in an interview. ''If decisions are made in time, there is enough time.''
He said the overriding reasons to stick to the June schedule were that President Hamid Karzai wanted to do so and because the timetable was laid out in the United Nations-sponsored Bonn Accords and endorsed recently in the new Constitution -- which called for every effort to be made to hold presidential and parliamentary elections at the same time.
