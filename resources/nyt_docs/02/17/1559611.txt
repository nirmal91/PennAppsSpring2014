''Head On,'' a story about a young Turkish-German woman who marries a drug-addicted man she doesn't love to escape her conservative Islamic family, won the top prize, the Golden Bear, at the 54th Berlin International Film Festival. Directed by Fatih Akin, a German of Turkish parentage, ''Head On'' is the first German film since 1986 to win the first prize. The Silver Bear for best director went to Kim Ki-Duk of South Korea for ''Samaritan Girl,'' about two schoolgirls who turn to prostitution. Charlize Theron, the star of ''Monster,'' shared the Silver Bear for best actress with Catalina Sandino Moreno of ''Maria Full of Grace.'' Daniel Hendler of ''Lost Embrace,'' about a young Argentine Jew, was named best actor. The jury, with the Oscar-winner Frances McDormand as chairwoman, gave the Blue Angel Award for best European film to Sweden's ''Om Jag Vaender Mig Om'' (''Daybreak''), directed by Bjoerne Runge.
