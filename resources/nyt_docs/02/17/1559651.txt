The German drug maker Merck said it had agreed to sell a subsidiary, VWR International, which is based in Pennsylvania, to the investment company Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice for $1.68 billion. The sale of VWR, a maker of laboratory products that was acquired in 1999, is expected to reduce Merck's debt significantly and raise money for the expansion of its more profitable drugs and liquid crystals businesses. In 2003, VWR counted for a third of Merck's sales but only 10 percent of its operating profit.
