The National Assembly passed a free trade agreement with Chile, the Asian country's first market-opening pact with a foreign country. Under the agreement, which was opposed by the nation's farmers, South Korea will remove tariffs on Chilean copper products, wool, tomatoes, wheat and more than 200 fish products, while Chile will get rid of tariffs on South Korean cars, cellphones, computers, televisions and air-conditioners. After the passage of the agreement was announced Monday afternoon, farmers, who had gathered to protest, tried to enter the Assembly compound and clashed with police.
