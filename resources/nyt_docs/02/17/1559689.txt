A 17-year-old Bronx teenager was arrested yesterday and charged with second-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of a high school student on Sunday morning, the police said. The suspect, Angel Castro, lives on the Grand Concourse, the police said, a block or so from where the stabbing occurred. The victim, Victor Garcia, 18, was attacked by a group of young men after leaving a house party. Several friends who were with him managed to escape, but Mr. Garcia was stabbed repeatedly in the torso and died shortly after 3 a.m. at St. Barnabas Hospital. Mr. Garcia's friends and family members said yesterday that they knew of no motive for the killing.
