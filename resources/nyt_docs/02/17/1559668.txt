The Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Company has begun a review for an agency to create campaigns around the world for Tanqueray gin, an assignment that has been handled since 1997 by the London and New York offices of J. Walter Thompson. Billings were estimated at $20 million.
Jane Smith, vice president and group product director at Schieffelin &amp; Somerset in New York, said that Thompson, part of the WPP Group, would not take part in the review. A Thompson spokesman, Owen Dougherty, referred calls to Schieffelin &amp; Somerset, a venture of Diageo and LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
In October, Schieffelin &amp; Somerset shifted the account of Baileys liqueurs from Thompson to Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London. Thompson continues to work for Schieffelin &amp; Somerset on the account of J&amp;B Scotch whiskey, and also handles Diageo brands like Smirnoff vodka.
