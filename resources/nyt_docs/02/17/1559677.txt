To the Editor:
Re ''A Home Away from Home for Dying Children'' (Feb. 10): The article provides valuable information about the George Mark Children's House in California, but it implies that children with a terminal illness currently have only two options: dying either in a hospital or at home.
In fact, there is at least one well-known residential hospice that has special rooms for children -- the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, located just east of New Haven. Parents and doctors on the East Coast should be aware of this option.
