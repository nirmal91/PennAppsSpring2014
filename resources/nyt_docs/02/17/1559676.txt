To the Editor:
A reader of ''New Biolabs Stir a Debate Over Secrecy and Safety'' (Feb. 10) might infer that there are many Biosafety Level 4 laboratories in the United States and that no more are needed.
In fact, only four such facilities currently operate in this country.
Considering the widespread availability of dangerous pathogens, and the fact that the United States suffered an anthrax attack three years ago (and another attack with ricin, a deadly toxin, just this month), maintaining several Level 4 facilities certainly seems reasonable.
