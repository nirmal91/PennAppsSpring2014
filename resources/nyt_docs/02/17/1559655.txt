The Royal Bank of Canada said it had reached a settlement with Rabobank of the Netherlands over Rabobank's purchase of a $517 million loan made by Royal Bank to Enron and subsequent refusal to pay for the loan. Royal Bank said the settlement would result in an after-tax charge of $56 million in the quarter ended Jan. 31. An examiner had said there was evidence the Canadian bank had helped Enron manipulate its financial statements.
