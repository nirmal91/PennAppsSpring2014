To the Editor:
''A Mind Emerges Joyfully After Years Lost in a Cloud'' (Feb. 10): Like the author of the article, Beverly Jablons, I too am thankfully wearing a shunt, which I initially thought was only for babies and young children. But I consider myself more fortunate than Ms. Jablons.
A perceptive doctor at a nearby clinic diagnosed my problem after quickly seeing that I did not have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. He then guided me to a hospital in Boston where the chief neurosurgeon inserted my shunt.
Now my mind, too, has ''emerged.'' I have just recently mailed off a novel to my publisher.
SHERRY BUNIN  Vinalhaven, Me.
