To the Editor:
Re ''In Middle Age, L.I. Suburbs Show Wear'' (news article, Feb. 12):
While clearly defining the changing Long Island labor and housing markets, your article understates the effects on Long Island schools. Increasing immigration and a higher birth rate among nonwhites are changing the face of suburban schools. Ethnicity data show a pattern toward greater diversity, especially in those school districts that are adjacent to large cities or have a longstanding minority population.
The continuing success of suburban schools, and the viability of Long Island as a quality place to live, will depend on the leadership shown by government leaders at all levels in meeting this new challenge.
