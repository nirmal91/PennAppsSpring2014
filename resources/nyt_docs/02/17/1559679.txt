As recriminations spread over the collapse of the roof of an indoor water park in Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin promised a thorough investigation.

''Those guilty must be punished,'' Mr. Putin said, making his first public remarks about a tragedy that officials said might have been caused by shoddy construction.
