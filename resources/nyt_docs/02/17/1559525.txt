To the Editor:
In her Feb. 10 Editorial Notebook, ''A Close Shave,'' Carolyn Curiel likens the inconvenience of pantyhose and hair removal to childbirth. Her comparison could not be more off: the former are uncomfortable, offer little benefit, are a way to conform to the ''female ideal'' in ''most cultures'' and are, frankly, unnecessary. The experience of childbirth is empowering, life-affirming, energizing and exciting.
I'd take childbirth over the use of any of the depilatory weapons she discusses any day.
