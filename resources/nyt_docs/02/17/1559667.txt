Two financial services companies known for selling mutual funds have made decisions in reviews.
Fidelity Investments in Boston has decided to continue with Arnold Worldwide in Boston as the creative agency of record on its account, an assignment that Arnold has handled for two years. Billings were estimated at $75 million.
Jenny Engle, a spokeswoman at Fidelity, part of the FMR Corporation, confirmed a report of the decision that appeared on Adweek.com. The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed, she said, to Arnold, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, and three other finalists: BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group; McKinney &amp; Silver in Raleigh, N.C., also owned by Havas; and TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom. The review was managed by Joanne Davis Consulting in New York.
Separately, TIAA-CREF in New York named TargetCast TCM in New York to handle media duties on its account, which had been handled by MindShare in New York, part of the GroupM division of the WPP Group. Although billings last year were estimated at $25 million, TIAA-CREF said it planned to spend significantly more in 2004.
The account becomes the largest at TargetCast, founded two years ago by Steven J. Farella, previously chief executive at the Havas media agency now called MPG, and Audrey Siegel, who had been a managing director at MPG. The creative duties for TIAA-CREF were shifted in November to Modernista in Boston after 17 years at the Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP in New York.
