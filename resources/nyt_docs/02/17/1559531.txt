Three of the most common screening tests for heart disease should not be used unless the patients have known risk factors or symptoms, according to a statement released yesterday by the government panel responsible for reviewing research on preventive medicine.
The panel, the Preventive Services Task Force, concluded that problems associated with the procedures -- electrocardiograms, stress tests and scans for calcium buildups in arteries -- clearly outweigh their benefit. The statement was published in The Annals of Internal Medicine.
Dr. Paul Frame, a member of the task force and a professor of family medicine at the University of Rochester, said that all three tests missed a significant number of disorders and produced an even larger number of false alarms. Even when accurate, he said, the tests rarely provide information more useful than a review of risk factors like smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and age.
Stress tests using treadmills, for instance, were based on the idea that they could identify people whose narrow arteries put them at risk for their first heart attacks. But researchers have learned that such heart attacks are caused by the sudden rupturing of plaque, and the tests cannot predict the ruptures, Dr. Frame said. ''All you're really accomplishing is that you might catch angina a little earlier,'' he said.
Dr. Frame said the effectiveness of the tests for people with symptoms or known risk factors remained unclear. The tests may be most useful in defining the condition of people at intermediate risk levels, he said. But for healthy people, ''primary prevention through traditional risk factor reduction is much more important than screening tests,'' he said.
