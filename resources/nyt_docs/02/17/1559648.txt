NBC has decided to replace Erik Sorenson, who has been president and general manager of its MSNBC cable channel since 2001, with Richard N. Kaplan, a senior vice president of ABC News and former president of CNN's United States operations, three executives at NBC and ABC said last night.
The appointment of Mr. Kaplan -- and the reassignment of Mr. Sorenson to a position at NBC headquarters -- is expected to be announced today by Neal Shapiro, the president of NBC News, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
No senior executive at NBC would comment on the record last night about why Mr. Sorenson was being replaced as the leader of MSNBC, a joint venture of the network, which is owned by General Electric, and the Microsoft Corporation.
But MSNBC, which was founded in July 1996, has long struggled to find an audience, and in recent years it has lagged behind Fox News, which is owned by the News Corporation, and CNN, which is owned by Time Warner.
''It was time for a change, to bring a new perspective to the channel,'' an NBC executive said.
Before being given the title of president of MSNBC, Mr. Sorenson had led the channel as its vice president and general manager since 1998.
In Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Shapiro has tapped one of the best-known executives in network news. Mr. Kaplan spent much of his career at ABC News, where, at various times, he served as executive producer of nearly every major program, including ''World News Tonight,'' ''Nightline'' and ''Prime Time Live.''
Mr. Kaplan left ABC News in 1997 to lead CNN's American operations. But he resigned from CNN in 2000 as the network's ratings sank to their lowest level in a decade.
Last February, he returned to ABC News after the resignation of Paul Friedman, the second highest-ranking executive in the news division. As a senior vice president, Mr. Kaplan was one of a small group of executives who reported to David L. Westin, the president of ABC News.
