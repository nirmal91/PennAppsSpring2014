A skin patch used to treat pain was recalled yesterday because one edge in some of the patches leaks. Janssen Pharmaceutica Products of Titusville recalled the Duragesic patch in its 75-microgram dosage. The company said about 19,000 patches might be affected. If medication leaks from the patch, patients may receive too much, resulting in nausea, sedation, drowsiness or potentially life-threatening complications. Too little medication may induce withdrawal symptoms like sweating, sleeplessness and abdominal discomfort. Anyone who comes in contact with an affected patch should rinse exposed skin with water. The control number of the recalled product, printed on the outside of the carton or the package's foil pouch, is 0327192. Patients who have the product should contact their pharmacist or physician, Janssen said. For more information, call (800) 526-7736 or visit www.janssen.com.
