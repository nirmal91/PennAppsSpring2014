To the Editor:
It is not always true that objects near the surface of the Earth are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other (''Beyond Brrr'').
In winter days with no wind and clear skies I see frost in my Bermuda grass lawn, even though the air temperature is well above freezing.
I suspect that the grass radiates away more power than it can absorb from the air. In other words, it is trying to reach equilibrium with the higher atmosphere and outer space, which are certainly much colder than 32 degrees.
