Raising Eyebrows
Q.  When eyebrows are shaved off or plucked, they always grow back to their original length. What signals them to stop growing?
A.  Scientists do not know the mechanism that makes eyebrows (and eyelashes) grow back to the same length, but are pursuing the answer because it could help them learn more about the causes of baldness.
Cells of the hair follicle, which produces a hair strand, have their own rhythm, and it does not appear to depend on external signals like seasons or, in the case of eyebrow hair, on familiar internal signals like hormones.
Both eyebrows and eyelashes have been found to be insensitive to levels of both male and female hormones.
Hair follicles move through a three-phase cycle of growth (called anagen); regression, with dwindling cell activity and the programmed death of some cells (called catagen); and telogen, a rest period in which the hair shaft is lost. Then anagen resumes.
The longer the anagen phase, the longer the hair. Anagen usually lasts from two to six years for scalp hair but runs for only a few months for eyebrows. Telogen is also much longer for eyebrows.
A prevailing theory is that there is an inherent and independent cycle clock for each follicle, established while the embryo is developing and present through life. Abnormalities in the cycle do not destroy the follicle and appear to be reversible, giving hope of cures for both unwanted hair loss and unwanted growth.
Be careful when plucking eyebrows, as these follicles are particularly susceptible to damage, which might mean no regrowth at all.
