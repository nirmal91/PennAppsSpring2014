Former Mayor David B. McCall Jr. of Plano, who as a savings and loan executive was convicted of fraud, was pardoned by President Bush, the Justice Department said. Mr. McCall, 79, served six months in prison after pleading guilty in 1996 to making fraudulent transactions in the 1980's at a thrift in Plano, a Dallas suburb. His wife, Nellie McCall, said Mr. McCall had cancer and entered a coma on Friday, the day before his pardon was approved.
