An event listing in the Connecticut section on Sunday for a lecture at the New Haven Public Library about ''Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, America's Obesity Crisis, and What We Can Do About It'' misstated the date and referred incorrectly to a co-author of the book. The event is at noon on Thursday; it was not yesterday. The co-author, Kelly Brownell, is a man.
