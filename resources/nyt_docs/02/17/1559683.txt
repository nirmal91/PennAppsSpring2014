The Legislature has approved a $4.4 billion budget, with $65 million in tax increases and $40 million in spending cuts for Medicaid. The budget, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, provides for a 6.6 percent increase, to $271 million, in spending from the general fund. The plan now goes to Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat.
