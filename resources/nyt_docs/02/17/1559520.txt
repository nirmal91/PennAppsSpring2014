To the Editor:
Re ''Walking a Beat in Tikrit,'' by Bing West (Op-Ed, Feb. 11):
It is true that Iraqi police forces need training. But I question whether the United States military is equipped to do this. It has not so far proved itself up to the task. Car bombings occur regularly in Baghdad, and there has not been even the promise of enough security to persuade humanitarian groups to stay in the country.
The United States could draw on experts in nation-building and policing, but instead we allow the Pentagon to control a situation better suited for the State Department and the United Nations.
Mr. West recommends that the Iraqi military spend more months under the control of the American military, but Iraqi independence would be best served by allowing Iraqi forces to draw on the guidance of a civilian administration.
