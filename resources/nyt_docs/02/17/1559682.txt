One of the largest border crossings was closed for an hour after Canadian officials found a grenade in the glove compartment of the car of an American trying to enter Canada. Inspectors found the grenade at 1 p.m. at Blaine, north of Seattle, said Paula Shore, a spokeswoman for the Canada Border Services Agency. Ms. Shore said the driver was released after she explained that her husband was in the military and that she did not know about the grenade.
