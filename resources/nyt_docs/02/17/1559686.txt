The police yesterday found the decomposing body of a missing New Jersey man in a wooded area near the West Shore Expressway on the western edge of Staten Island, not far from where his abandoned car was found last month, the authorities said. A previous search of the area had failed to turn up signs of the man, Robert Hopkins, 44, of Paramus, but yesterday, a city work crew found the body, the police said. It is unclear where Mr. Hopkins was going or how he died, but the police said there had been no signs of foul play. An autopsy is to be conducted today.
