Identifying patients with metabolic syndrome -- a relatively new term for a cluster of health problems -- is far more effective than looking at weight alone as a way of predicting heart attack risks, a study released yesterday says.
Patients are considered to have metabolic syndrome if they have three or more of these problems: obesity centered around the waist; high blood pressure; low levels of the good cholesterol; difficulty metabolizing blood sugar; and high levels of triglycerides, which are related to cholesterol.
The study, which is being published in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association, drew on data collected from 780 women who entered the study with suspected heart disease. Over four years, those classified as having metabolic syndrome were twice as likely to die or have heart attacks as those who were obese but did not meet the syndrome's criteria.
A second study published in the same journal yesterday that drew on the same pool of patients found that among those women in whom heart disease was diagnosed at the start of the study, those with metabolic syndrome were almost five times as likely to have heart attacks as those who did not. The studies were led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh.
Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association and the chief of women's cardiology care at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, who had no connection to the studies, said they underscored the importance of looking at more than weight.
If women think they are at risk for metabolic syndrome, they should at least get their blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose tolerance checked, she said.
