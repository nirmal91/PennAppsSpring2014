A plan to reassign 260 employees of the State Department of Correctional Services will be postponed until after the state budget is enacted, officials said yesterday. The plan for a forced reassignment of 245 uniformed and 15 civilian officers from the Watertown, Cape Vincent, Riverview, Marcy, Orleans and Collins state prisons in central and northern New York was originally scheduled for March 31. Glenn S. Goord, the commissioner of correctional services, said the delay would protect the seniority rights of all workers.
