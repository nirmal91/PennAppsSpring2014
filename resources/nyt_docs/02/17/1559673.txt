To the Editor:
Re ''Beyond Brrr: The Elusive Science of Cold'' (Feb 10): As a member of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, I applaud the recent efforts to scientifically quantify each person's perception of cold with improved wind chill parameters.
Polar bears regularly put physiology, societal norms and individual perception of the weather aside and embrace the idea that ''every day is a beach day.'' Being unclothed outside in the dead of winter is one thing, leaping into frigid water is another -- call it the ''water chill.''
To cope with the sudden loss of body heat, we rely on a Zen-like secret: winter swimming is more spiritual than physiological.
