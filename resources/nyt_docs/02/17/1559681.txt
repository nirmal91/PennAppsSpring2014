Prime Minister Paul Martin said he was anxious to testify before a judicial inquiry into a growing scandal involving the funneling of public money into Quebec public relations firms aligned with the governing Liberal Party. Mr. Martin also subtly hinted that Jean Chr√©tien, who was prime minister when the program was in place, may want to do the same. Opinion polls indicate that the scandal is carving into the lead held by the Liberals heading into elections expected this spring. Mr. Martin's comments came a day after he said he would resign if he was found to have played any role in the scandal.
