Welfare recipients in city-mandated work programs are entitled to the same protections against sexual harassment and sexual discrimination as regular employees, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on Friday. The decision reversed a lower court ruling in favor of the city, which had argued that because welfare recipients receive grants, they are not regular employees. City lawyers said they were not sure if they would appeal the verdict. Several women in the workfare program alleged that they had been mistreated by supervisors and had no legal recourse. In May 2001, the Department of Justice sued the city, saying it did not have policies to protect people from sexual harassment and discrimination.
