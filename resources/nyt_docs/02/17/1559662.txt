Re ''Cloning Creates Human Embryos'' (front page, Feb. 12):
When is this administration going to wake up?
It is so paralyzed with fear of offending its Christian right political base that it is making the United States a second-class country in scientific research.
While most scientists see a shining advance of medicine and science in human stem cell research, President Bush and his advisers do not.
They might want to consider some experts' opinion that this breakthrough achieved by the South Korean scientists will eventually create a billion-dollar market.
