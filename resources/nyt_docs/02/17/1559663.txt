To the Editor:
The successful cloning of a human embryo in South Korea (front page, Feb. 12) is another example of disrespect for human life.
Embryonic stem cell research means the killing of a human being to extract the embryonic stem cells; adult stem cell research has the same potential for good without the killing of a human being.
We must begin to show respect for human life at all stages of development.
