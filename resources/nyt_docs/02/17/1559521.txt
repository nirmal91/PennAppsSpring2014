To the Editor:
Re ''Forward Steps for Spelling Bee,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Feb. 11):
Mr. Winerip is absolutely right that by fifth or sixth grade, it is too late to intervene for many students at Birney Elementary School in Washington, or, by extension, at any other inner-city public school. By then, student deficits in socialization, motivation and intellectual development are too daunting to remedy.
That's why the decision on Tuesday by school officials in Los Angeles to expand kindergarten from a half day to a full day for the district's 432 elementary schools makes sense. It is part of a national trend that has resulted in 60 percent of kindergartners attending for a full day. Maryland, for instance, has converted to full-day kindergarten, which gives students more time to master basic skills and develop discipline.
Let's hope that all states and the District of Columbia follow suit.

Correction:  February 21, 2004, Saturday  A letter on Tuesday about the benefits of kindergarten referred incorrectly to the District of Columbia's policy and practices. The district requires school attendance from age 5 and offers a full day of kindergarten to age-eligible children.
