Six weeks after a breakthrough agreement between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, diplomats from the countries met to lay the groundwork for a sustained peace dialogue.

The longtime rivals last held formal peace talks in Agra, India, in 2001.
