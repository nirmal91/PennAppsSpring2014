Richard G. Convertino, the federal prosecutor who led the government's first major terrorism trial since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has sued the Justice Department and Attorney General John Ashcroft. Mr. Convertino says the department violated his First Amendment rights by removing him from the case and leaking details of an investigation on his conduct to newspapers in Detroit. A representative of the department had no comment.
