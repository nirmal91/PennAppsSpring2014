Godiva Chocolatier has ended a six-month review of its account by deciding to continue with Margeotes/Fertitta &amp; Partners in New York as agency of record. Spending on the account, handled by Margeotes/Fertitta for 27 years, was estimated at more than $5 million.
Michael Simon, vice president for marketing and merchandising at Godiva in New York, part of the Campbell Soup Company, said the review had been narrowed to Margeotes/Fertitta, which is majority owned by MDC Partners, and Clarity Coverdale Fury in Minneapolis. Godiva has plans to revamp its advertising this year and to perhaps double or triple its spending on marketing.
