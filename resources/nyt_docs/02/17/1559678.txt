To the Editor:
Re ''E.P.A. Raises Estimate of Babies Affected by Mercury Exposure'' (Feb. 10): I assume I was not alone in doing a double take over this article and another one published in the same edition.
First, I read that ''one child in six could be at risk for developmental disorders because of mercury exposure in the mother's womb.'' I then read a second article that mentioned several toxicologists who testified before a federal panel that mercury levels were higher in children with autism.
Is this merely a coincidence?
