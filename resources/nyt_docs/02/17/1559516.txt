Most children killed in alcohol-related crashes in the United States from 1997 to 2002 were riding with drunken drivers, a new government study reports.
The research also found that only one-third of the children killed while riding with drivers who had been drinking were wearing seat belts or were buckled into car seats. Most of those drivers survived, suggesting that many of the children could also have lived if they had been buckled in, the study said.
The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was published Feb. 6 in the center's journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. It contradicts a widespread image of drunken, irresponsible strangers' plowing into the cars of helpless families.
Instead, the data, collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, suggests that the real problem stems from drivers who do two reckless things -- drinking and failing to use seat belts -- to endanger children who may well be their own, said Dr. Ruth A. Shults of the disease control agency.
Of 2,335 children 14 or younger who died in alcohol-related accidents in the 6 years covered by the study, 68 percent were riding with the drinking drivers, who had an average blood alcohol level of 0.13. The legal limit in most states is 0.08.
Thirty-two percent of the children killed were wearing restraints, far fewer than the average in the passenger population at large, she said.
