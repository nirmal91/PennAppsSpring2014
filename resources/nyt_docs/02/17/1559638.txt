An article last Tuesday about a student who shot and injured a teacher at his high school in East Greenbush, N.Y., misstated the number of people killed by two students in the earlier attack at Columbine High School, near Littleton, Colo. A correction in this space yesterday repeated the error and misstated the year of that attack. Not counting the killers, who committed suicide, the victims totaled 13, not 15. The year was 1999, not 1991.
