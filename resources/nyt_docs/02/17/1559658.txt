A Queens man was arrested yesterday, a day after he took his infant son to the hospital with critical injuries, including a fractured skull, the police said.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday, the man, identified by the police as Mauricio Vasquez, 28, of Flushing, took his 7-week-old son to Flushing Hospital Medical Center. He was accompanied by the baby's mother, whom the police did not name.
''It looks like he dropped the baby and somehow shook the baby,'' a Police Department spokeswoman said. The child was suffering from multiple skull fractures, broken ribs and bleeding in the brain, the spokeswoman said. He was in critical condition last night, she said.
Yesterday, Mr. Vasquez was charged with first-degree assault, reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, the police said. The child's mother was not charged.
A neighbor, who said she lived on the second floor of the multifamily house on 165th Street where Mr. Vasquez lives, said she was shocked to learn of the charges. Mr. Vasquez, a cleaner, often talked about his new son and bought a camera for his birth, said the neighbor, who spoke on the condition that she not be identified. ''He was crazy about what happened,'' the neighbor said. ''He cried all night. He's a very sweet guy, and I know he loves his boy.'' The neighbor said that she had heard from one of Mr. Vasquez's friends that the injuries were the result of an accident, but she added that she had not spoken with Mr. Vasquez since the child had been hurt.
A co-worker of Mr. Vasquez, Alan Castro, said that Mr. Vasquez had been working hard to earn extra money for the baby and its mother.
