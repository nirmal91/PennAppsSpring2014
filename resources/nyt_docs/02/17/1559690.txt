An autopsy on the decomposed body of a man who was found in a duffel bag in the trunk of a car in Bay Ridge late Sunday determined that he had died from a single gunshot wound to the head, the authorities said yesterday. The body was found just before 11 p.m. Sunday in the trunk of a maroon Mazda parked in front of 402 100th Street, the police said. The car had been parked there for about three weeks, the police said, and several people had called to complain.
