To the Editor:
Your Feb. 13 editorial is on the mark in supporting a ban on reproductive cloning but encouraging pursuit of therapeutic cloning (''The Cloning Success in Korea''). Unfortunately, the Bush administration advocates a total ban on cloning.
Mr. Bush and the religious right believe that life begins at conception and, as such, creating human embryos with the intent of therapeutic cloning amounts to the destruction of a human life. The reality is that stem cells are derived not from a human being but from a microscopic ball of cells.
Embryonic stem cells obtained from these balls of cells are then chemically manipulated to generate specialized cells that, it is hoped, will be used in the future to generate new functioning organs.
Given the shortage of donor organs and the prevalence of damaged tissues due to disease or trauma, therapeutic cloning and stem cells hold great potential in ultimately saving thousands of lives every year.
