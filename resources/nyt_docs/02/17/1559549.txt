A new study that tracked 2,259 students as they moved through middle school found strong links between sleep patterns and moods.
Students who got less sleep were more likely to report signs of depression and a negative self-image, according to the study, which was published Feb. 6 in the journal Child Development.
The study also found that as sleep patterns changed, so did emotional states: students who got more sleep reported improvements, while students who got less were more likely to report problems. Students who got less sleep in sixth grade had worse grades that year, but changes in sleep patterns did not appear to have an effect on performance in seventh and eighth grade.
Earlier research had shown that adolescents needed about nine hours a night -- more than adults or younger children. Still, middle schools generally start earlier than elementary schools.
On average, the students' total time spent sleeping fell in the three years, but the pattern was more pronounced among girls. The girls' average in eighth grade was 7 hours 17 minutes, one minute less than the boys' average and down from 8 hours in sixth grade. In sixth grade, boys averaged 46 minutes less girls.
The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jean E. Rhodes, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said that girls seemed to get up earlier than boys. She speculated that they might spend more time on grooming or chores.
Dr. Rhodes said parents could help their children ''figure out how to schedule and manage their time in ways that incorporate all of the necessities of middle school life'' and still get to bed in time for a good night's sleep.
