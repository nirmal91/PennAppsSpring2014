New Yorkers are familiar with a kind of true urban legend -- stories of freak fatal occurrences like falling bits of skyscraper facades and taxis that suddenly come careering through restaurant walls and run over diners. Last month they added another story to the list. An exposed wire under a metal plate electrocuted a woman as she walked her dogs in the East Village. City residents may be fatalistic, but in the aftermath of this kind of tragedy they rightfully expect a response that addresses not only the immediate problem, but also the wider systematic failure that allowed it to happen.
As it admitted responsibility for the accident, Consolidated Edison announced that it was stepping up its inspections of the city's 250,000 manholes and utility boxes. Still, pedestrians should be excused if they spend more time than usual peering down at the road before them.
Since the Jan. 16 death of Jodie Lane, a doctoral student in clinical psychology at Columbia University Teachers College, Con Ed says it has diverted workers from other duties and brought in contractors to allow a complete inspection of the underground system and sidewalk boxes in one month's time. So far, of 3,000 sites inspected, about 15 were giving off voltage and required repair. At that rate, there could be more than 1,000 problems found.
Ms. Lane had the misfortune of falling on the cover of a utility box electrified with 57 volts from an exposed wire. A wire typically is wrapped in adhesive rubber tape and then plastic is placed around that. The wire in question was missing the rubber layer and had been for about a year. Inspections had been on a schedule that could sometimes allow a site to go unchecked for years. Con Ed needs to convince the public not only that it has eliminated current hazards, but that it has improved its inspection methods so that nothing like this can ever happen again.
