To the Editor:
Yes, we have gotten better at diagnosing autism, but the increase in autism is real and in dire need of our attention and of serious research dollars (front page, Jan. 26).
Few of us can remember knowing an autistic child back in the 1950's and 1960's. Most of us are familiar with one today.
