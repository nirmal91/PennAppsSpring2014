To the Editor:
Re ''Principal's War Leads to a Teacher Exodus,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Jan. 28):
As a former New York City teacher, I am all too familiar with the tactics used by principals to expunge ''undesirable'' instructors. Often the greatest fault of these teachers lies not in their pedagogical approach but in their refusal to yield to the unreasonable dictates or mercurial personalities of the principal.
Teaching English in a school on the state list of failing schools, I worked with some of the city's most challenging, underserved students. I spent my own money to buy supplies, tutored students after school and helped to raise students' citywide reading scores substantially.
My principal showed his appreciation by reassigning me to teach science (a subject I'm not certified in) to non-English-speaking students and providing me with no classroom or desk in which to keep my materials and personal items safe.
He got what he wanted: I left teaching and haven't looked back.
