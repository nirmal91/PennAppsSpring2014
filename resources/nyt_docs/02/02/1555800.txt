An article in The Arts on Dec. 27 about the marketing of books, music and videos to secular and Christian audiences misspelled the surname of an author who has sold five million books in the Christian market and whose ''Soul Survivor'' was marketed by Doubleday as a mainstream title. He is Philip Yancey, not Yancy. The article also misspelled the surname of a co-author of the apocalyptic series ''Left Behind.'' He is Tim LaHaye, not LeHaye.
The article also misstated the title of a television series on HBO, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which has an evangelical book division as well. It is ''Sex and the City,'' not ''Sex in the City.'' An e-mail message from a reader last week pointed out the errors.
