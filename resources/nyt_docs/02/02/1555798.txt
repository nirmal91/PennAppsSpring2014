A chart in the sports pages on Jan. 8 showing the tenure of coaches in the National Football League misstated the year in which the Baltimore Ravens began play and omitted the year the current Cleveland Browns franchise began play. The Ravens' first season was in 1996, not 1999. The current Browns began play in 1999 after the original franchise moved to Baltimore and was renamed the Ravens.
