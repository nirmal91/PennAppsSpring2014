The Gillette Company in Boston has expanded its relationship with BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, by naming the agency to handle worldwide creative duties on the account of Braun appliances and personal care products, which had been handled by Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $50 million to $60 million.
The decision was made after Gillette began to consider whether to keep the assignment at Lowe or move it to another agency on the Gillette roster, like BBDO or Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. Before a formal review could start, Lowe withdrew from consideration and Gillette awarded the assignment to BBDO, which has worked for Gillette since 1966. The assignment will be carried out by BBDO offices in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany; London; and New York. It had been led from the Lowe London office.
