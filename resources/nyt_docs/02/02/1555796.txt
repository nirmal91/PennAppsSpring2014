An article on Jan. 20 about belly dancing in Egypt and a new law that bans foreign women from working as headline dancers in Cairo clubs and tourist resorts misstated the given name of the 19th-century French novelist Flaubert, who was among the first foreigners to write about Egyptian belly dancers. It was Gustave, not Auguste.
