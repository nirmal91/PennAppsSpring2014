The City Council wants the city to create a Web site comparing prescription drug prices at every pharmacy in the city to help consumers find the best prices, Council officials said yesterday. The Council released a survey finding that New Yorkers could save as much as 40 percent on prescription drug costs by comparison shopping. Eric N. Gioia, the chairman of the Council's Oversight and Investigations Committee, said putting the prices on the Web would pressure pharmacies to keep their prices low. The Bloomberg administration said it was ''willing to build'' on efforts to protect consumers.
