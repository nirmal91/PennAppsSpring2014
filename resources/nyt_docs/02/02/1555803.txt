In addition to their usual set of captains, the Carolina Panthers named their linebackers coach, Sam Mills, and linebacker Mark Fields honorary captains for the game.
Mills has intestinal cancer and has continued coaching through his chemotherapy treatments. Fields has Hodgkin's disease and recently completed his chemotherapy.
Fields expects to be able to play again next season. Both illnesses were diagnosed during the preseason, and the team has been wearing T-shirts with their numbers on them under their uniforms all season as inspiration.
