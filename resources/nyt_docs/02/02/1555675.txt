It is 30 years since the players of New York City had the pleasure of being host to a national championship, but their turn has come again. In July enthusiasts from all corners of North America and some from foreign parts will converge on Manhattan and battle for 10 days. The 1974 attendance of 15,310 tables is likely to be eclipsed.
The play will be directed by the highly professional employees of the American Contract Bridge League. All other activities, like hospitality, registration, entertainment and partner finding, will be done by local volunteers. Anyone who would like to help is asked to call Jim Schneider at (614) 754-7194.
In 1974 a declarer was lured to his doom on the diagramed deal. It was played in the Master Mixed Teams, in which overtricks are crucial. After a heart lead against three no-trump, South won with dummy's 10 and led the club king to drive out the ace. West won and persevered with a second heart.
The declarer was now on track to make 11 tricks, but he did not know that the favorable lie of the spades could give him four tricks in the suit. After cashing the ace-king, he could take a marked finesse of dummy's eight.
Instead three club winners were cashed, putting the lead in the closed hand in this position:
South could still have settled for 11 tricks at this point, but he did not know it. He tried the diamond jack, and it won the trick, leaving him a chance for 12 tricks. He should have cashed his heart winners but rashly continued with a second diamond, sure that the queen was on his left. To his dismay Frank Merblum, sitting East, claimed five tricks for down one.
