To the Editor:
Back in the 1960's, a student avoided answering my essay-test question by accusing me of malfeasance for daring to teach Whitman while our soldiers were killing and being killed in Vietnam. One of today's students ('' 'Mona Lisa Smile': How Different Are Students Today?,'' letters, Jan. 28) complained that he was cheated of what he paid ''dearly to learn'' by professors who trot the Iraq war into the classroom.
The college instructor who passes up the rare chance to exploit a parallel between today's news and the subject matter provides students with something less than their dime's worth as well as denying them a lively classroom exchange and a challenge to think.
My student robbed himself egregiously by failing to read Whitman and missed his day by skipping a class on Whitman's war poetry, which fired his classmates into a lively argument over Vietnam.
