To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (''Red Ink Realities,'' column, Jan. 27) says ''the ultimate goal'' of conservatives ''is to slash government programs that help the poor and the middle class, and use the savings to cut taxes for the rich.''
This is a pejorative way of describing the desire to allow people to keep their own money.
Redistribution of wealth is not one of the truths the Declaration of Independence held to be ''self-evident.''
