To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (''Red Ink Realities,'' column, Jan. 27) continues to document how the Bush administration's economic policies are skewed to favor higher income strata at the expense of the middle and lower economic groups.
The previous day, William Safire inveighed that when this is pointed out by Democratic candidates, it represents their engaging in ''class warfare'' (''The Kennedy Comeback,'' column, Jan. 26).
So, let's see. Bush policies favoring one economic class over others is not class warfare, but pointing out that such policies are inequitable is class warfare.
George Orwell would have loved this.
