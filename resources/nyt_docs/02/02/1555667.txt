Re ''Maker Warns of Scarcity of Hormone for Dairy Cows'' (Business Day, Jan. 27):
Monsanto will now produce half the usual amount of growth hormone for dairy cows after the Food and Drug Administration found ''quality control'' problems at the factory, yet the company is raising the hormone price by 9 percent.
Dairymen say that will mean somewhat less milk, but fatter milk checks for them.
Good! Maybe now dairy farmers will finally see the futility of injecting cows with genetically engineered hormones that consumers neither want nor trust.
