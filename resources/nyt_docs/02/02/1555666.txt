To the Editor:
After just one caucus and one primary, in not very diverse states, and after concluding that ''voters deserve to have a real choice,'' you write that Representative Dennis J. Kucinich and the Rev. Al Sharpton ''should not be allowed to take up time in future candidate debates'' and that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman may have ''hit his ceiling'' simply because he has already run for vice president (editorial, Jan. 28).
These candidates are trying to provide choices to the American people, half of whom are alienated or not likely to vote in the general election.
At a point when most Americans are not yet even paying attention to the 2004 race, you would think that a newspaper befitting of its mission to inform people would stop trying to restrict information flow to the public by eliminating candidates, their diverse platforms and their public stimulation of your designated front-runners in the presidential debates.
Whether candidates are ''credible'' or ''serious'' is the prerogative of the voters, in duly scheduled elections, not the New York Times editorial board.
