To the Editor:
Re ''Single and Paying for It,'' by Shari Motro (Op-Ed, Jan. 25):
The government should not be in the marriage business. If people want to get married, they should do so in a private ceremony (religious, if they wish), at their own expense, and without government involvement.
The government shouldn't recognize gay marriages. The government shouldn't recognize any marriages. Economic benefits should be bestowed by the government without regard to marital status.
This issue should not be confused with the legitimate concern that the government has to ensure the well-being of children.
But children who are the fruit of a married couple should not (and their families should not) have economic benefits bestowed upon them by the government that are not equally bestowed upon children whose parents are not married.
