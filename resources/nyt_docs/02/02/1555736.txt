Antonio Reid, a music executive who fostered the careers of artists like Outkast and Pink, is in negotiations to join the Island Def Jam Music Group, according to a person close to the talks.
Two weeks ago Mr. Reid abruptly left Arista Records, where he had been chief executive for four years. Known for being a savvy hit maker, he also had a reputation as a big spender. According to music executives who have worked with Mr. Reid, financial losses at Arista were a factor in his leaving.
Soon after he left Arista, Mr. Reid met with Doug Morris, chief executive of the Universal Music Group, where Island Def Jam is a division, the person close to the talks said. The Los Angeles Times reported the discussions on Saturday.
If Mr. Reid joins Island Def Jam -- and it is a big if, as any agreement is more than a week away and could fall apart -- he would take the place of Lyor Cohen, who recently joined Time Warner Music to become head of its North American operations. Mr. Cohen was chief executive of Island Def Jam.
Mr. Reid is expected to be offered a three-year contract, according to the person close to the talks, and would be walking into a markedly different company from his former employer. Island Def Jam is known for hip-hop performers like Jay-Z and Public Enemy, though it later branched out to represent artists like Mariah Carey and Bon Jovi. Mr. Reid is better known for being at the forefront of the anti-Britney Spears wave with singers like Pink and Avril Lavigne.
Also at the Universal Music Group, Jimmy Iovine, chairman of Interscope, the label with acts like Eminem and Dr. Dre, has extended his contract for five years, the company said. Mr. Iovine has been at the forefront of industry efforts to create a standard in digital music as well as to stem piracy on the Internet.
As part of his deal, Mr. Iovine would be allowed to pursue ventures outside music. Last year, he was co-producer of the Eminem movie ''8 Mile.''
