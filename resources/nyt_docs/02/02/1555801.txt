Linebacker Mike Vrabel, the Patriots' unlikely offensive hero of Super Bowl XXXVIII, sat on a podium chair staring into the cameras, his smile as radiant as the television lights, his 3 1/2-year-old son, Tyler, perched on his lap.
About 30 minutes earlier, Vrabel was in the Patriots' huddle listening to quarterback Tom Brady call a play -- 1-36-Y Cross Z-Flag -- above the din of the stadium crowd.
Vrabel, inserted as a third tight end, admitted he was nervous. ''I'm a wreck when I get in on offense,'' he said. ''It's so much faster than playing defense.''
When Brady dropped back to pass, he found Vrabel for a 1-yard touchdown that let the Patriots regain the lead from Carolina, 26-22, with 2 minutes 55 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
Vrabel, who played tight end in high school, is no stranger to the end zone. He also caught a 1-yard touchdown pass last season against the San Diego Chargers.
''Fauria and Graham will be mad at me when I get back to the locker room,'' Vrabel said of the Patriot tight ends Christian Fauria and Daniel Graham.
Vrabel, who sustained a broken arm earlier this season, also contributed in his specialty: defense. He had two of the Patriots' four sacks.
When asked if any other player had finished with two sacks and a touchdown in a Super Bowl, Vrabel said ''That will be a good trivia question.''
