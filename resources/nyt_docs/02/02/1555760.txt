In the digital age, the recording industry's continuous search for new talent includes scouting promising young intellectual property lawyers.
At a ceremony this week ahead of Sunday evenings Grammy Awards, the nonprofit Grammy Foundation will honor a law student, Lisa Blackburn, the winner of its sixth annual legal essay contest. Her winning article, ''Title Blanding,'' discusses the way federal trademark law can collide with First Amendment free speech expression, when it comes to song titles.
One of her examples is a case pending in federal court, in which the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks has sued the rap group Outkast on trademark-infringement grounds for using her name as the title of a song. Standard trademark law has been developed for things like knock-off Kate Spade bags; ''it doesnt account for an artists freedom of expression,'' Ms. Blackburn, a second-year University of Michigan law student, said in an interview. Although she has never taken a course in entertainment law, Ms. Blackburn said, ''I learned through researching and writing this article that I love it.''
