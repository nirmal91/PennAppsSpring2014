To the Editor:
Re ''Autism Cases Up; Cause Is Unclear'' (front page, Jan. 26): The federal government, in concert with groups advocating for autistic children, has created a 10-year plan to examine the causes, diagnosis and treatment of autism. While a good foundation, this is an unfinanced plan at the beginning of a political process.
Moreover, the road map does not address the critical shortage of intervention services for the thousands of autistic children and adults living today. Access to these services depends on eligibility formulas that vary from state to state, school district to school district and agency to agency.
Until equal access to the best programs is ensured, the quality of life for children and adults with autism will continue to be substandard.
