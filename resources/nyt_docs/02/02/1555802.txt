All week leading to the Super Bowl, one of the bigger nonfootball questions was whether Reliant Stadium's retractable roof would be open or closed during the game.
Aerosmith had requested the roof be closed for its pregame performance, and the N.F.L. said its plans were to keep the roof closed.
But Sunday dawned with the best weather of the week -- sunny skies and the temperature in the 60's. Still, with a possibility of rain, the roof stayed closed, blocking out the blue sky in favor of metal girders crisscrossing the roof. It also kept the smoke from the pregame fireworks trapped inside in a hazy layer -- meaning it was cloudier inside the stadium than out.
The roof is the technological marvel of Houston's new stadium. It takes seven minutes to open or close. For Texans games, the roof-or-no-roof decision is made before the game and is only closed in the case of severe weather.
