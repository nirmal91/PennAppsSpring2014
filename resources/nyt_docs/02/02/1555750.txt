In another consolidation of a large media assignment, the Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago has named Starcom U.S.A. in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe, to handle all media strategy, planning and buying duties on its United States accounts. Total annual spending for those assignments, which had been divided among Starcom and six other agencies, was estimated at $200 million.
The agencies eliminated from the Sara Lee media roster are two units of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., and the Winston-Salem, N.C., office of Mullen; the Chicago office of MPG, part of Havas; the Chicago office of OMD, part of the Omnicom Group; the Dallas office of Optimedia, part of the ZenithOptimedia division of Publicis; and Shahid &amp; Company in New York. Sara Lee brands include Ball Park Franks, Hanes and Playtex.
The decision, made without a review, is part of an effort by Sara Lee to make its ad spending more efficient. Among other large marketers that have recently reassigned or are considering reassigning media accounts are AOL, American Express, Coca-Cola North America, Masterfoods U.S.A. and S.C. Johnson &amp; Son.
