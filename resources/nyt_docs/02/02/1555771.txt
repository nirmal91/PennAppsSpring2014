Re ''As Autism Cases Rise, Parents Run Frenzied Race to Get Help'' (front page, Jan. 30):
As the parent of a 10-year-old boy with autism, I find it difficult to describe the determination you must have to create a successful program that will work with and not against your child. One misconception that I hear over and over is that school districts are reluctant to waste money on lawyers and that parents are anxious to exercise their due process rights against their school district.
At best your chance of winning this kind of case is about 50-50. We won our case against the Stamford School District, but it took five years, 33 hearing days, $180,000 in legal fees, and an indescribable emotional and physical toll on our family.
I can deal with the autism, but I can't deal with the ignorance and wastefulness of school districts that would rather pay lawyers than teachers.
