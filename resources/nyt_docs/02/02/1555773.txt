To the Editor:
The cause of the dramatic increase in recognized cases of autism is a puzzle that has no definitive answer (front page, Jan. 26). What we do know with certainty is that the young children so identified will have a much better chance of typical futures if they receive early and intensive educational services delivered with great skill.
We know that autism is not a unitary disorder but rather a spectrum of disorders. The 4-year-old who doesn't speak or understand speech, who may bang or hit his head repeatedly, who appears oblivious to people much of the time, is quite different from the 4-year-old who can recite large numbers of facts and do mathematical computations but is oblivious to people much of the time and engages in odd, repetitive behaviors. Both need highly skilled intervention, although not of the same type.
What we can do is provide increased education and training to prepare teachers and other school personnel to become better providers of services to children with autism.
