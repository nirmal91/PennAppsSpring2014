Re ''Principal's War Leads to a Teacher Exodus,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Jan. 28):
A fundamental thing wrong with the New York City public school system is that good, dedicated, hard-working individuals in the system find their efforts thwarted at every turn by either an incompetent or a self-serving administration, or both.
While Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein claim to be remaking the system (not just renaming it), the situation at Brooklyn Technical High School and the disturbing behavior of its principal and the regional superintendent suggest that the mayor and the chancellor do not have a clue as to what is wrong with the system or how to fix it.
