One year after the shuttle Columbia broke apart over Texas, NASA workers held a quiet memorial on Sunday at the moment of destruction.
''One year ago, at this very hour, the unthinkable occurred,'' the Kennedy Space Center's director, Jim Kennedy, told the crowd of a few hundred who gathered at the memorial here.
Mr. Kennedy recited the names of the Columbia astronauts, carved into the black granite monument behind him: Rick Husband; William C. McCool; Michael P. Anderson; David M. Brown; Kalpana Chawla; Laurel Salton Clark; and Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon.
''Their loss will not be in vain,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We will come back bigger, better and stronger than ever before, and I can assure you that crew and their beloved families will never, ever be forgotten.''
The ceremony began at 9 a.m., the instant NASA lost communication with the Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. It ended at 9:16 a.m., the time the spacecraft should have landed.
Many of the East Texas towns where the wreckage fell also held tributes. And in Houston, where the Columbia astronauts lived and Mission Control is situated, the astronauts were saluted in a pregame show at the Super Bowl.
Aerosmith and Josh Groban performed, and the seven astronauts scheduled to fly the shuttle Atlantis as early as September accompanied a color guard onto the field.
