Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob (Bill Murray) are both Americans suffering from jet lag in a Tokyo hotel. They meet in the bar.
BARTENDER -- What can I get you?  CHARLOTTE -- I'm not sure.  BOB -- (Line from commercial) For relaxing times, make it ----  BOB AND BARTENDER -- Suntory time!  CHARLOTTE -- What are you doing here?  BOB -- My wife needs space, I don't know my kids' birthdays. Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.  CHARLOTTE -- Oh. I'll just have a beer.  BOB -- What about you? Why are you here?  CHARLOTTE -- My husband's here for work -- he's a photographer -- and I just came along . . . I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.  BOB -- How long have you been married?  CHARLOTTE -- Two years.  BOB -- Try 25.  CHARLOTTE -- You're probably just having a midlife crisis. Did you buy a Porsche?  BOB -- I'm thinking about it.  CHARLOTTE -- Twenty-five years . . . that's a long time . . . Are you still in love with your wife?  BOB -- Yes . . . I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was . . . actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was 21. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said O.K., and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Fran√ßois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia . . . but I always really liked Lydia.  CHARLOTTE -- Oh.  BOB -- What do you do?  CHARLOTTE -- I'm not sure, yet . . . I graduated last spring.  BOB -- What did you study?  CHARLOTTE -- Philosophy.  BOB -- Oh, what do you do with that?  CHARLOTTE -- I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.  BOB -- It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.  CHARLOTTE -- Thanks. I'm sure your midlife crisis will work out, too.  BOB -- Thanks.  CHARLOTTE -- I wish I could sleep.  BOB -- Me, too.
