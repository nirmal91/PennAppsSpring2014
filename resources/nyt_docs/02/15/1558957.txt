To the Editor:
The article about living in the Flatlands neighborhood of Brooklyn [''Diverse, Well-Groomed Residential Area,'' Feb. 1] touches on the area's early Dutch history, but it fails to mention that the oldest structure in the city, the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House (built about 1652), still stands in what was historically the village of Flatlands (now at Ralph Avenue and Clarendon Road in East Flatbush) and is open to the public six days a week as a living history museum.
One of a handful of remaining early settlement houses in the country, the Wyckoff House is also a National Historic Landmark and was the first structure to be designated a New York City landmark upon the creation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965.
The house is the centerpiece of the Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum, whose mission is to educate visitors about the diverse people of Brooklyn's colonial farms. The museum offers a year-round program of school and public programs and in 2003 played host to more than 5,000 visitors.
