FACTORY MADE
Warhol and the Sixties.
By Steven Watson.
Pantheon, $27.50.
Andy Warhol's Factory was a silver-painted loft in Manhattan that existed between 1964 and 1968, where he collaborated with friends, artists and socialites to produce movies, sculptures, books, photographs and, of course, paintings. As Steven Watson, whose books include ''The Birth of the Beat Generation,'' explains in ''Factory Made,'' the Factory was ''above all, a zone of possibility and play.'' Fueled by widespread amphetamine use and a willingness to run with new ideas, Warhol and his cohort pumped out new experimental projects at an incredible rate. Attracting models, artists and famous people to the Factory helped Warhol realize his dream to be a superstar. Watson's account gives hundreds of details of the projects, the drugs, the squabbles and the social life inside the Factory, even though the book is written as a series of disconnected tidbits that do not add up to a story.
