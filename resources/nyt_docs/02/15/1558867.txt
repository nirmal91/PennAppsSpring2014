To the Editor:
I was deeply disappointed by Serge Schmemann's survey of the literature critical of America and American foreign policy (Jan. 25). As if the books reviewed weren't sufficient in their contempt for our nation's direction, Schmemann makes sure to include his own caricatured understanding of President Bush and his foreign policy.
Ivo H. Daalder and James M. Lindsay's book, ''America Unbound,'' is informative and sober, even if critical, and the only one that deserves scrutiny. Far from adding to sensible debate, George Soros, Chalmers Johnson, Robert Jay Lifton, Emmanuel Todd and Tariq Ali seem locked in a competitive struggle to see who can most furiously malign the United States. Ali, for example, asserts that American generals didn't act to stop museum lootings in Baghdad because it would have meant admitting that the ''ragheads'' had a culture. Does such nonsense really merit reiteration?
