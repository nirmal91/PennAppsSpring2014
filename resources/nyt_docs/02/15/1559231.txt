To the Editor:
In ''Found: A Smoking Gun'' (column, Feb. 11), William Safire claims that the recent Kurdish capture of a courier in northern Iraq, who was carrying notes that supposedly request help from Al Qaeda, ''demolishes the repeated claim of Bush critics that there was never a 'clear link' between Saddam and Osama bin Laden.''
In actuality, it is well known that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden despise each other.
What this recent discovery has really proved is that the Bush administration's unprovoked war on Iraq has had the exact opposite effect of what we were originally promised. Instead of diminishing terrorists, it is actually uniting them.
