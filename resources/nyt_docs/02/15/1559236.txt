To the Editor:
Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (Op-Ed, Feb. 10) are correct that H.I.V. testing is the missing intervention in breaking the chain of H.I.V. transmission globally, but testing need not be mandatory to be widely used.
When people are comfortable with the Voluntary Counseling and Testing setting, they come. The reputation of testing settings, including competence and integrity of counselors, expertise of lab technicians, attitude of support staff and privacy of location, all influence the choice to test for H.I.V. Health department marketing of H.I.V. awareness and prevention stimulates testing, but testing may be more acceptable when offered through independent, community-based testing services.
When given the choice to test freely in these settings, many at highest risk choose to learn their status, even at asymptomatic stages of the disease. Mandatory testing at specified life stages is more likely to discourage people who need it most from seeking routine health care.
