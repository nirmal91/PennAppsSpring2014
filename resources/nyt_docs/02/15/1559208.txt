There she goes, Miss America?
Reacting to the abysmal ratings of last year's pageant, ABC has decided to cut its broadcast from three hours to two.
Art McMaster, the interim chief executive of the Miss America Organization, refused comment on the negotiations with ABC, saying through a spokeswoman that statements he made earlier in the week to The Press of Atlantic City -- proposing to eliminate contestants' talent performances from the broadcast -- were premature.
Instead, ABC and Miss America issued a statement on Thursday that was obscure at best. ''In light of continued speculation and recent news reports regarding the Miss America Pageant telecast,'' the statement said, ''there is currently no deal in place for this year's telecast, and furthermore, that no creative discussions and/or agreements regarding any aspect of the annual telecast have taken place between.''
While the recent success of shows like ''Star Search'' and ''American Idol'' have shown that Americans may revel in amateur talent in prime time, it could cease to be a part of the televised Miss America pageant, which has long insisted that it is not just a beauty contest.
