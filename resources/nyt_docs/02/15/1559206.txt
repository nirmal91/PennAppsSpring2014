Are plummeting poll ratings prompting the governor to look for votes in all the wrong places?
What else can explain a fax from a group called the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project -- whose goals include building a memorial in every county in the nation to the 40th president -- praising the governor for proclaiming Feb. 6 Ronald Reagan Day.
''Governor McGreevey should be praised for his foresight in recognizing Reagan's achievements on his birthday,'' wrote the group's president, Grover Nordquist.
Micah Rasmussen, Governor's McGreevey's spokesman, was unaware of the fax and sounded a bit flustered when asked about it.
''I think what's happening is -- and I'm surmising this -- the governor issued a proclamation now being used by this group as an endorsement of this project to build monuments, which I don't think is one and the same,'' Mr. Rasmussen said.
But a proclamation for this president who created a new political subspecies, the Reagan Democrat?
''That doesn't mean the governor doesn't think he's someone who should be honored,'' he said. ''I think we all agree that President Reagan made this country feel good about itself again.''
''And besides,'' Mr. Rasmussen added, ''this governor does not shy away from issuing bipartisan honors to Republicans.''
Like whom?
''That's a good question,'' he said. ''I'll have to look into that.''
