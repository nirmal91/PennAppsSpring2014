Re ''Alarming Data on Security Alarms'' [Jan. 25]: The professional installation companies, manufacturers of these devices and private monitoring facilities all acknowledge as our No.1 responsibility the importance of the reduction of false alarms. There are several programs on local and national levels that help to educate the user, the installation companies and police departments; the Long Island Alarm Association facilitates one of them.
It is easy to blame this false alarm problem on the electronic security industry, but we are all at fault to some degree: The homeowner who forgets her password, the alarm company that fails to provide sufficient instruction, even some police departments' ''non-abort'' policy, which does not allow the monitoring operators to cancel a dispatch in the event that the alarm user calls back with that password.
The sub-headline on the article called alarms ''a dubious deterrent to a few; a nuisance to everyone else.'' Documented interviews with thousands of convicted burglars have pointed out that burglars hate sirens and will virtually always go on to easier pickings. When a neighbor's siren rings it is a nuisance. When a burglar kicks in your back door and your siren rings, it is a godsend.
