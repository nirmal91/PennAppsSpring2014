To the Sports Editor:
Colorado football players take recruits to a strip club. The football program is accused of hiring an escort service. St. John's suspends basketball players for going to a strip club and having sex with a woman they met there. The Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the St. John's president, denounces a culture that has instilled an attitude that certain behavior is permissible. When will college presidents learn it is the moneymaking culture of college competition gone awry that has led to the outrageous behavior of some students for whom college courses are irrelevant?
Big-time varsity sports have surrendered to the allure of television funds and the support of immature alumni to seek out young men for their athletic teams whether or not they can meet the academic demands. Colleges need to get their priorities straight to maximize educational opportunity and to minimize the importance of developing conference champions.
