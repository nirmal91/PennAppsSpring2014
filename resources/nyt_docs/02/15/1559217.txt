To the Editor:
Although the Mount Kisco Medical Group may be a winning model for its physicians, ( ''For Group Doctors, a Winning Model,'' Feb. 1) it certainly isn't a winning model for either the health care community or a winning model for the patient community it serves.
Regardless of the stated reasons behind the Mount Kisco Medical Group's decision to remove its outpatient surgery business from the community hospital directly across the street, the result is taking away the lucrative procedures on which hospitals can make money and leaving only those cases where hospitals cannot even cover their costs.
Yet, the Mount Kisco Medical Group could not grow to what it is now nor can they practice medicine effectively without that excellent community hospital across the street. Their removal of outpatient surgeries to their own privately held facility was a greedy blow to the entire medical community and the community.
With regard to the medical group as a winning model for patients, apparently patients and families measure customer satisfaction in different terms than the group measures it. Patients report difficulty getting through on the telephone, difficulty in reaching one's personal physician directly and long wait times both for appointments and on the day of appointments.
Although the Mount Kisco Medical Group deserves congratulations for building a model that at least works for some (the doctors in the group) while the rest of the health care world has failed to build a model that is a winning one for anyone, the group also provides a model for poor citizenship in the health care community, poor loyalty to the community hospital which is the cornerstone of local health care and poor role models for young physicians who need to find a balance between these competing interests.
