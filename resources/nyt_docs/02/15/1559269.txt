On Feb. 1 you published a letter bemoaning the fact that the New York City section of the Long Island Expressway refurbishment project, from the Cross Island Parkway eastbound to the Nassau County line, does not include shoulders or a high-occupancy-vehicle lane.
Both of these decisions were forced on the State Department of Transportation by the City of New York, which filed a lawsuit against the project. As part of the settlement, the city made sure that there was no H.O.V. lane from the Cross Island eastward to the Nassau line.
It is unfortunate that the City of New York has forced a position upon the Transportation Department that makes carpooling more difficult for our residents and drivers. But we all know that consistency is for small minds.
