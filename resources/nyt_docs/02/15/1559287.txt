To the Sports Editor:
In ''President of St. John's Links Woes to Jarvis Era'' (Feb. 8), the Rev. Donald J. Harrington links his scandal to the former coach, Mike Jarvis. Too often big-time college sports attempts to mask its root problem by laying blame on student-athletes and coaches.
The buck, however, should stop at the desk of college presidents. The negative impact of big-time college sports is especially seen at smaller universities like St. John's that are trying to keep up with giants. At Michigan, the intramural facilities dwarf St. John's one ancient gym. The poor coach of a university like St. John's cannot compete with that. He takes what is left after Duke, Michigan and U.C.L.A. whisk away the cream athletes in private jets.
This root problem at St. John's and similar universities is a fertile ground for scandals transcending individual coaches and athletes, and it lies squarely on the desk of the president. Only the president can decide when it is time to stop using the valuable resources of a tuition-driven university in a hopeless quest to get into the Final Four. Small universities should create sports programs in balance with their primary calling, education.
