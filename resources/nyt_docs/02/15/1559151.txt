Form 1040 is a summary of income, adjustments to income, deductions and credits. It shows most of those amounts as bottom-line figures brought forward from other forms and schedules that are part of the return. Taxable income and the tax due on it, along with any refund or payment due, are calculated on Page 2 of the 1040. Using tax software or an online preparation program simplifies the process because the user needs only to answer interview questions. The program does all the calculations and puts the answers on the forms.
First, gather your papers. Employers, banks, brokers and others who pay you money must send copies of W-2 and 1099 forms, showing those payments, to you and to the Internal Revenue Service, which has programmed its computers to compare what payers reported with what taxpayers report on their returns. An inaccurate amount can lead to trouble.
Like most married couples, this hypothetical couple -- Samuel and Felicity Taxpayer -- are filing jointly (Line 2). They claim four exemptions (Line 6) -- two for themselves and one each for their daughter, Heidi; and Samuel's father, Luke, whom they support.
The Taxpayers have several sources of income. Any W-2 forms, reporting wages and salaries, must be attached to returns. The amount in Box 1 of the W-2's is entered on Line 7 of the 1040. Felicity earned $87,000.
Interest income is reported on Line 8 and dividend income on Line 9. People who had more than $1,500 in taxable interest or dividends must file Schedule B, and the totals are listed on the 1040.
People who received a state tax refund last year, as the Taxpayers did, must generally report on Line 10 any part of the refund that was included in itemized deductions on their 2002 returns.
Samuel, a consulting engineer, is self-employed. His income of $59,742 is calculated on Schedule C and listed on Line 12. Capital gains of $627 (Line 13) come from Schedule D. People who had income from pensions, real estate, farms, Social Security payments and unemployment compensation -- this couple did not -- must also report it on this section of the return.
Although the Taxpayers' total income is $151,761 (Line 22), their adjusted gross income is only $132,540 (Lines 34 and 35), thanks to three adjustments. The first is for $4,221, one-half of Samuel's self-employment tax (Line 28). The second is for his $9,000 contribution to a Simple retirement plan for self-employed workers (Line 30). The normal maximum for such plans is $8,000 a year, but because he was at least 50 years old, he was able to make a $1,000 catch-up contribution. The third adjustment is alimony of $6,000 (Line 32a) that Samuel paid to his first wife, whose Social Security number must be shown (Line 32b).
After itemized deductions of $24,843 (Line 37, from Schedule A) and four personal exemptions worth $12,200 (Line 39), taxable income is $95,497 (Line 40).
Their tax is $17,298 (Line 43). Some taxpayers can claim credits that offset taxes dollar for dollar in the lines that follow for things like foreign taxes, education and adoption expenses, but this couple could not. Parents whose modified adjusted gross income is less than $110,000 are entitled to a $1,000 credit per child under the age of 17, but most received a $400 rebate check last summer for part of it. The Taxpayers' income was too high to take the credit for Heidi.
Samuel's self-employment tax of $8,441 (Line 55 from Schedule SE) brings their total tax to $25,739 (Line 60). After Felicity's withholding of $18,000 (Line 61) and estimated tax payments of $7,200 (Line 62), they owe $539 (Line 72). That shows good planning: they have paid enough to avoid an underpayment penalty but not enough to get a refund. People who get refunds have lent the Treasury money interest-free.
