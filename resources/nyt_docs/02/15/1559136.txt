On a business trip to New York last week, Francesco Trapani, the chief executive of Bulgari who is based in Rome and spends a third of his time on the road, reeled off a list of his favorite places to stay. They include the George V in Paris, Claridge's in London, the Peninsula in Hong Kong and the Four Seasons in New York.
But when Bulgari opens its first hotel, in Milan in May, it will be different from those places, he said.
The hotel, developed as a joint venture with Marriott International and its Ritz-Carlton brand, will stand out, Mr. Trapani said, both for its service, which he considers paramount, and its location in the middle of a large private garden near La Scala, the opera house.
The hotel will have only 52 rooms and will offer guests a personal shopper and whatever car they desire.
The architect, Antonio Citterio, has never before worked with Bulgari, which makes jewelry, watches, toiletries and accessories. And that is the way Mr. Trapani likes it. ''We didn't want the hotel to be very similar to a Bulgari store,'' he said. ''We don't think our clients want to sleep in the store.''
