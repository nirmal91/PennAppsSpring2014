HOW TO BE FASHIONABLE  OR CONSUME LIKE ME  By Andrew Coulter Enright  The Tyntpress, download  from Tyntpress.com, 28 pp., free.
BOOTISM  A Shoe Religion  By Michael Duranko  and Penina Goodman  Andrews McMeel Publishing, 48 pp., $10.95.
FROM the pronouncements of Diana Vreeland to the language of a T-shirt, fashion has long yearned to express itself in the manner of an Eastern religion.
''Bootism: A Shoe Religion'' is perhaps the sharpest line of this little book of koans, vows and definitions like, ''Yin: the purchase. Yang: the compliment. Where did you get that?'' For greater depth, pair ''Bootism'' with ''How to Be Fashionable or Consume Like Me,'' an irony-rich collection of Jenny Holzer-like epigrams for the style-obsessed that include, ''Eat Edamame'' and ''Wake up on a stranger's couch. Later, realize it was an Eames original.''
The Tyntpress, publisher of ''How to be Fashionable,'' has a manifesto on its Web site that proclaims its intention to make books by young artists that express ''our view of popular culture,'' ''free of the preciousness that attaches itself to projects like Visionaire,'' without ''creating fussy little books,'' in a ''punk-rock ethos.''
The bound book, the company's first effort, is a limited edition that is already sold out, but you can print it from the company's Web site, which is certainly nice and punk rock-y, though the fact that ''How to Be Fashionable or Consume Like Me'' has a corporate sponsor, the boutique Thompson Hotels group, is not.
