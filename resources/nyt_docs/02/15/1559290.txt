To the Sports Editor:
It is sad that since 1950, 14 N.H.L. rule changes have addressed the number of players a team can suit up or the uniform color players must wear, but only four have targeted increased scoring.
Enlarging rinks is expensive and unnecessary. Simple rule modification is all that is required. Begin with the goalies. Before 1918, they actually incurred a penalty if they dropped to their knees to make a save. Reduce pad size, restrict roaming and shrink the crease. Broaden rules governing a penalty shot, one of the most thrilling moments in sports. Liberalize passing rules.
Higher scoring games will boost excitement, attendance and revenue. It's about time the N.H.L. joined the N.B.A., the N.F.L. and M.L.B. in promoting more offense . . . at least for the fans' sake.
