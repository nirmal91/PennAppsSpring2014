To the Editor:
In his review of my book with Mike Mochizuki, ''Crisis on the Korean Peninsula,'' Serge Schmemann gets our basic argument wrong. We expressly do not favor rewarding North Korea with large amounts of economic aid to surrender its nuclear weapons program. We propose a much broader deal, to avoid the charge of appeasement and to begin to change the basic nature of North Korean society. The United States and its regional partners would offer Pyongyang non-cash assistance, normal trade relations, full diplomatic ties and security assurances only if North Korea also agrees to gradual marketization of its economy, deep cuts in its extraordinarily large conventional military forces, verifiable elimination of chemical weapons and long-range missiles, and improvement of its human rights policies.
