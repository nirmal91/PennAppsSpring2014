Medical expenses (Line 1) can be deducted only to the extent that unreimbursed outlays exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, which in this case would be $9,941 (Line 3). They do not qualify (Line 4).
The couple can deduct state and local income taxes of $8,389 (Line 5) as well as real estate taxes of $7,380 (Line 6) and home mortgage interest of $6,750 (Line 10). Because Samuel works from a home office, the mortgage interest and real estate taxes applicable to that part of the house are reported on Form 8829.
They also deduct gifts to charity of $2,324 (Line 18). If audited, filers must be able to show a receipt for any single gift of $250 or more. The $330 on Line 16 is for old clothing and toys donated to a church rummage sale and reflects the prices at the sale, not the Taxpayers'original cost.
Like most filers, the Taxpayers could not take a miscellaneous itemized deduction (Line 26) for such things as union dues. That is allowed only to the extent that such expenses exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income ($2,651 on Line 25).
Their itemized deductions total $24,843 (Line 28).
If you claim any deductions for which you have no evidence and are then audited, you will probably have to pay additional tax, interest and a penalty; if any are overlooked, you will pay too much tax.
