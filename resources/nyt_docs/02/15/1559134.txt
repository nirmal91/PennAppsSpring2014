Just as JÃ¼rgen Schrempp might have thought he could breathe a sigh of relief, he couldn't, thanks to Stern, the German news magazine.
Testimony concluded last week in a lawsuit by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, against DaimlerChrysler, in which he contended that Mr. Schrempp, its chief executive, knew that the 1998 deal that created the company was not going to be a ''merger of equals,'' as promised.
In the current issue, Stern depicts Mr. Schrempp as isolated, surrounding himself with a dwindling group of aides, while DaimlerChrysler's problems mount.
The DaimlerChrysler board is expected to decide this year on whether to extend Mr. Schrempp's contract, which is set to expire in 2005. The magazine suggested that he could be ousted if the company did not become solidly profitable.
''The clock is ticking'' for Mr. Schrempp, the article said. DaimlerChrysler would not comment when asked about the article.
