To the Editor:
Regarding: ''On Marriage and Other Pressing Concerns'' (Feb. 1): In this discussion of President Bush's proposal to promote ''healthy'' marriages, why was it necessary to include a paragraph that reflects so negatively on Peekskill itself?
People in that city are working hard to build it up. Let's concentrate on the positive.
Why not mention the beautiful Victorian homes that owners are lovingly restoring? Or why not commend the numerous groups, working together, which provide the meals being served at the soup kitchen?
