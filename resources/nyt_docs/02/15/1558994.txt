To the Editor:
In ''A Cold War Battle, Fought on the Ice'' [Feb. 8], Charles McGrath gently chides the movie ''Miracle'' for its bent toward earnest uplift. Confoundingly, Mr. McGrath finds it ''sad'' that the movie does not include more cussing or beer drinking, because it would otherwise have been more accurate.
Please, Mr. McGrath, consider the possibility that most people, even my 11-year-old son, are already aware of the off-ice reputation real-life hockey players have. In the case of our team from the 1980 Olympic Games, I tip my hat to Disney for presenting it as representing far more than beer and cussing.
