The Southampton Town Board last week unanimously approved plans for a private 100-acre organic golf course in Shinnecock Hills that has won praise from environmentalists but has drawn heavy criticism from local preservationists who hoped to save Bayberryland, an English manor house on the property.
Special zoning was required for the golf course because the 298-acre property that overlooks Peconic Bay and abuts the National Golf Links of America is zoned for residential use. The approved plan includes an 18-hole golf course built with liners beneath the greens to capture and recycle rain and irrigation water, a 35,000-square-foot clubhouse, a 7,500-square-foot owner's residence and 15 cottages to be used by members for overnight stays.
The owner of the property, Michael Pascucci, who also owns Channel 55 in Melville, has agreed to donate 54 acres to the town for wetlands and park use. He also will give the town 3 acres of beachfront, 1.25 acres for beach parking, $500,000 for its park site acquisition and improvement fund, $500,000 for cultural and historic preservation and $200,000 to extend a nearby water main.
Mr. Pascucci bought the property nearly three years ago from an electrical union that had used it as a conference center and summer camp. Preservationists had hoped to save the 28,000-square-foot stucco mansion that was built for Charles H. Sabin, the chairman of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, but state preservation officials deemed the house ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Mr. Pascucci has agreed, however, to keep the estate's original wrought-iron front gates.
''I think it's a great use for the property,'' said Councilman Dennis Suskind. ''The alternative was to have as many as 65 large estates with swimming pools and tennis courts built there.''
