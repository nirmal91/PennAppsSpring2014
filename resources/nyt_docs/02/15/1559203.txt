Last summer, Elizabeth Shriver, known as Liddy, then 36, joined 24 cyclists from around the world for six days of biking in Denmark, despite her continuing battle with cancer. She was participating in the Shriver Family Bike Tour for Sarcoma Research, an event organized by her parents, Bruce and Bev Shriver, of Ossining, to raise awareness about sarcoma and the lack of adults in clinical trials.
In January, Elizabeth Shriver died.
Her parents have established a nonprofit, charitable organization called the Liddy Shriver Sarcoma Initiative, with goals of providing information about sarcoma and its treatment, and to help finance organizations that are involved in sarcoma research.
In addition, two weeks after Elizabeth Shriver's death, her parents began an educational online resource called the Electronic Sarcoma Update Newsletter. It includes news about clinical trials and treatments and , links to related organizations. Information is available at www.liddyshriversarcomainitiative.org and at (914)762-3251.
