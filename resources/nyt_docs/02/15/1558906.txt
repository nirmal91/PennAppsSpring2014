An essay (The Way We Live Now, Judith Shulevitz, Feb. 1) purporting to be critical of the way the media treats first ladies and protective of their right to lives of their own repeats two gratuitous insults, one for Teresa Heinz Kerry (''blowsy sensuality'') and one for Judith Steinberg Dean (''unyielding frumpiness''). To what purpose, I wonder? So they will know what to expect should either become first lady?
