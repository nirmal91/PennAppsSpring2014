For her next act, former Gov. Christie Whitman will try her skills in the classroom later this month, when she will make an appearance as a distinguished visiting professor at Montclair State University.
Ms. Whitman, who most recently headed the Environmental Protection Agency for President Bush, is scheduled to teach about 40 students on Feb. 24, in classes titled ''Women and Politics'' and ''Women, Power and Politics,'' in a program that the university uses to bring people's real-life experiences to the classroom.
Students may be more impressed with Ms. Whitman's governmental insights and policies than some of her Democratic rivals.
''Apparently she's teaching a class on non-environmental policy,'' said State Senator John Adler, a Democrat from Camden County and the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
