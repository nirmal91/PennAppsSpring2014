Donald Trump says his private real estate development company is the biggest in Manhattan. His reality television show, ''The Apprentice,'' has blockbuster ratings nationwide. Now Mr. Trump seems to have even bolder plans for his public company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts -- even though it is burdened with $1.8 billion in debt. Mr. Trump says the company will go global as soon as it completes a major refinancing effort that was announced on Thursday.
The refinancing plans are very preliminary, but they include a $400 million equity investment from Credit Suisse First Boston, which will replace Mr. Trump as the company's majority shareholder. Mr. Trump, who will remain as the company's chairman, said the investment would reduce Trump Hotels' debt load on its Atlantic City properties and free up capital.
The company now owns just three casino hotels, all in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana, but Mr. Trump plans to build new towers for the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal, and possibly expand abroad. Of course, there is no guarantee that the deal will go through, in part because it is contingent on bondholders taking a discount on their notes.
But it wasn't too early for Mr. Trump, in anticipation of the cash influx, to announce plans to change the company's name to Trump International.
''We have the hottest brand in the world -- you can see this by the television show -- and this will allow us to take advantage of it,'' he said. Also, he noted: ''We just thought it was a bigger name. I was never a fan of the other.''
While Mr. Trump may have international visions, many on Wall Street think that for now he should have his eyes glued to the bottom line since the company is now in the red.
