To the Sports Editor:
The best-in-show triumph of Josh, a Newfoundland, at the Westminster Kennel Club competition would have been no surprise to two earlier judges of these sturdy working dogs. Two hundred years ago, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark traveled to the Pacific with another black Newfie they called Seaman. On the evening of May 28, 1805, Seaman likewise emitted ''a spontaneous bark,'' which, while not charming the crowd, earned the deeper gratitude of the explorers by preventing a runaway bison from trampling the men sleeping around a campfire.
