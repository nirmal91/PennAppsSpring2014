Keisha Castle-Hughes
Subtlety, restraint and nuance are not the usual attributes of child actors, but they are the qualities that describe Keisha Castle-Hughes in ''Whale Rider.'' She seems natural as Pai, the 11-year-old Maori girl destined to lead her people, but a lot of young actresses would have been natural.
The fascination of her performance lies rather in a coupling of apparent artlessness with a sense of mystery -- something the movie badly needs.
If you can read the title, you can predict how ''Whale Rider'' will end, but it's impossible to plumb the drives and intuitions that Ms. Castle-Hughes summons up beneath Pai's solemnly gawky surface.
Although her spine is as straight as a Maori battle stick, Pai clumps about flat-footed, with her toes turned out. Although she's often called upon to make ceremonious gestures -- her life seems to be a perpetual round of school performances and community-center rituals -- she still plucks her skirt girlishly into an impromptu tent.
This prepubescent awkwardness endears Pai to the audience and makes her seem terribly vulnerable when she stands up to her disapproving grandfather. (He's a scowling carved totem to her wisp of grass.) But it also serves another purpose: Pai's un-self-consciousness contrasts with her intense inner life.
Watchful and quiet, she says little and seldom raises her voice, right up to the scene of her big public breakdown. At this occasion for maximum histrionics, Ms. Castle-Hughes does not let the emotions come bawling out but continues to show how Pai tries to hold them back.
It's an extraordinarily moving moment -- one that improbably persuades you that this scrawny, shivering girl really might be plugged into an ancient spiritual source.
