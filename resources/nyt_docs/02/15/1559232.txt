To the Editor:
Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (''A Global Battle's Missing Weapon,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 10) are correct that testing is a crucial element of a comprehensive AIDS strategy. But their diagnosis of the problem in Uganda is incomplete.
A few weeks ago, I visited Ugandan health clinics. Despite government support for testing, many clinics in both rural and urban areas have no voluntary testing kits, often for months; elsewhere, health workers must travel many miles to be tested, at their expense, following needle stick injuries. And even when testing is available, people tested gain little in return except discrimination, much of it virulent.
This is not a clash between civil liberties and public health. Until the health system is strengthened, the promise of counseling and treatment becomes real and the government does more to end discrimination against people who are H.I.V.-positive, testing will not succeed.
