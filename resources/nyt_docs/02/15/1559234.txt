To the Editor:
Re ''A Global Battle's Missing Weapon,'' by Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (Op-Ed, Feb. 10):
Promotion of AIDS testing with no hope of treatment seems particularly cruel. And in a part of the world where rapes of young girls are on the rise because of a belief that sex with virgins cures AIDS, will early testing really prevent the spread of disease?
Where women have achieved relative equality with men, testing is very likely to encourage safer sex. Will testing in those areas of the world where women are vulnerable result in better health for the entire population, or a new lower class of infected, outcast women?
I fear that the suggestion of mandatory testing before the birth of a child will have the effect of punishing women, possibly for their husbands' infidelity. With such a plan, women would receive mandatory testing with far greater frequency than men.
What works in the United States may be disastrous in Africa.
