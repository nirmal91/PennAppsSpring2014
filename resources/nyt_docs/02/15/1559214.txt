Attorney General Peter C. Harvey last week agreed to pay $1,500 to settle a complaint with the Executive Commission on Ethical Standards over some free boxing tickets he received from the State Boxing Commission. There was no admission of wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Mr. Harvey drew fire last year after reports that he had used Boxing Commission ringside seats to take his wife and friends to a heavyweight fight between Evander Holyfield and Chris Byrd in Atlantic City in December 2002. As a member of the commission, Mr. Harvey is entitled to free tickets. Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the attorney general, said Mr. Harvey did not know at the time it was improper to take guests to the bouts.
''It was a rookie mistake, and it will not be repeated,'' Mr. Loriquet said.
