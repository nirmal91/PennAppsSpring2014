To the Editor:
William Safire (''Found: A Smoking Gun,'' column, Feb. 11) says that a plea for Qaeda reinforcements, supposedly written by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is the ''smoking gun'' that shows ''a 'clear link' between Saddam and bin Laden.''
Saddam Hussein (perhaps) aided Mr. Zarqawi, a suspected Jordanian terrorist who supports Al Qaeda. But that doesn't show that Saddam Hussein conspired with Osama bin Laden. C.I.A. interrogations of top Qaeda leaders have revealed that Osama bin Laden ruled out cooperation with Saddam Hussein; documents seized during Saddam Hussein's capture warned Baathists against joining Islamic jihadists.
This search for the missing link masks a strategic blunder that allows a diversionary war of choice to undermine the war of necessity against Al Qaeda.
Suicide terror now plagues Iraq for the first time since the 13th-century Assassins. From Jan. 14 to Feb. 11, Iraq suffered nine suicide bombings, killing more (257) than in any country for any monthly period since 9/11. Al Qaeda, undeterred by Saddam Hussein's capture, must be pleased.
