To the Editor:
Because I rely on The New York Times Book Review to keep me posted on what I don't have time to read, I would appreciate your publishing an equally thought-provoking article reviewing some of the ''ardent pro-Bush books'' that Serge Schmemann refers to . . . just in the interest of being fair and balanced, of course.
