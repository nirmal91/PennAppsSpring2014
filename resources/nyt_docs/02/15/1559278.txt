Two men were found dead yesterday in a Harlem apartment, both shot in the head, leaving detectives searching for a weapon and a motive, the police said.
The bodies of the men, Desmond Vaughan, 30, and Sergio Santana, 29, were discovered at 1 a.m. in a fifth-floor apartment at 211 West 145th Street near Seventh Avenue, the building where Mr. Vaughan lived, the police said. Neighbors said he lived in the apartment where the bodies were found.
Mr. Santana's address was given by the police as 889 Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx.
A neighbor in the building who spoke on the condition that she not be named said that she had heard people arguing in the apartment sometime before the killing.
The police said that drugs and money had been found in the apartment and that the shooting appeared to be drug related.
''This is a shock,'' said Jeffrey Holder, 38, the manager of a laundry in the building. ''This is the last guy you'd think of.''
He said Mr. Vaughan often stopped by to leave stacks of leaflets advertising poetry readings. The last flier he left was to promote a reading of ''Standing in the Need of Prayer,'' a volume recently published by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Mr. Vaughan traveled to South America last summer, Mr. Holder said.
