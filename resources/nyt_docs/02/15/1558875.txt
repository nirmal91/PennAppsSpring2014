With Love and Laughter.
By Sid Caesar with Eddy Friedfeld.
PublicAffairs, $26.
It's about time we heard from Sid Caesar, the comedic giant who elevated sketch comedy into an art form as the star of ''Your Show of Shows'' and ''Caesar's Hour'' during the 1950's. ''Caesar's Hours,'' written with the entertainment journalist Eddy Friedfeld, is not exactly the story of his life, but rather the history of his comic craft. Whether he is casually recalling how he acquired ''the gift of double-talk'' listening to the foreign customers at his father's restaurant in Yonkers or providing detailed analyses of beloved characters like the battling Hickenloopers and the blowhard Professor, his anecdotes read like the workbook notes of a master craftsman eager to pass on all he knows about sketch comedy. ''All my comedy was character and plot driven,'' says Caesar, who devotes entire chapters (with script excerpts) to the reconstruction of his best skits and most inspired characters. He gives plenty of credit, it should be noted, to collaborators like Imogene Coca and Carl Reiner and the stable of brilliant writers -- including Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart and Lucille Kallen -- he called ''my Praetorian Guard.'' When he puts his work aside to take on personal matters like his notoriously wicked temper, Caesar seems a little bashful. (So maybe he did dangle Mel Brooks from an 18th-floor window of a Chicago hotel -- but it was no big deal because ''Mel knew that I was strong enough to hold him.'') But if you want to talk comedy, Caesar the Great is still the go-to guy.
