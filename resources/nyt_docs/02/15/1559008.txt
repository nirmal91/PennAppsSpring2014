To the Editor:
Re ''Getting to Know You,'' (Jan. 4). The article about vanity license plates hit upon one of my favorite car hobbies. For years, I have kept a 3-by-5 card on the visor of my car and have accumulated what I call my license plate hall of fame.
I got started on this hobby when I lived in Philadelphia. One of my neighbors was a graphic artist whose last name was Vann. His plate read: VANN GO. I was hooked.
In fact, when my son was writing college essays and was complaining that he had only 500 words to tell a college who he is, I suggested that he try six or seven letters! I have always admired people who could put the essence of the life in such a small space.
I present the Turner License Plate Hall of Fame:
