Ben Kingsley
Ben Kingsley is an actor of immense, often ominous interiority. A slight, wiry man, he plays outsize characters whose power derives from a sense of volumes left unspoken, emotions roiling beneath the surface, threatening to burst their restraints. That surface is as eloquent as the fin of a shark: it's what you don't see that matters most.
But what if a part called for Mr. Kingsley to let passion rip? In ''House of Sand and Fog,'' it does, and the outcome is some of his best work. Mr. Kingsley plays Col. Massoud Behrani, an exiled, financially pressed Iranian military officer caught up in an escalating dispute over a modest Northern California bungalow. Behrani is an authoritarian paterfamilias capable of violence and proud of his former association with the Shah; yet he's also deeply principled, and his devotion to his family is the force that drives his life. With typical precision, Mr. Kingsley peels back the layers of this complicated man, but late in the story he exposes the character's raw core.
In a scene that sets in motion the movie's horrific denouement, Behrani witnesses the shooting of someone dear to him. With a wail of anguish, he clasps the victim to his chest, blood blooming on his shirtfront as if from his own shattered heart. After being questioned by the police, he races to the hospital where the victim has been taken; directed to a waiting room, he throws himself to the floor in the Muslim prayer position and frantically bargains with God. This kind of prolonged, full-bore emotion can reduce good actors to melodrama. Not Mr. Kingsley, who, even in extremis, inflects his grief with a sense of things not just unspoken but unspeakable. His still face and desperate eyes convey a dreadful truth: No scream is sufficient to express such loss.
