There has been another barge in trouble in Stamford Harbor.
In the latest incident, a 110-foot unmanned barge was taking on water as it was towed into the harbor last Sunday, the Stamford police said.
Sgt. Peter J. Wolf said the barge was pulled out of the shipping channel by its tugboat and allowed to sink in about 17 feet of water, about 200 yards from shore.
The United States Coast Guard said it found no pollution as a result of the incident, but was investigating it further.
On Wednesday, the cargo was being off-loaded onto another vessel.
Coincidently, the barge, which is owned by Buchanan Marine of New Haven, was destined for the same terminal from which a barge owned by a different company broke free on Dec. 15 during a storm.
That barge ran aground in the Shippan section of the city, but not before causing damage to boats in nearby marinas and private property along the coast.
O&amp;G Industries, a construction services company that operates the terminal, said such incidents were rare.
''All of the companies that pull barges into our terminals have good safety records,'' said Kenneth W. Merz, a secretary for O&amp;G Industries.
Buchanan Marine would not comment on the incident, but Sergeant Wolf said the company told him the barge could have been damaged by ice at a previous stop.
''When it comes to the marine industry, you're kind of at the mercy of nature,'' he said.
