More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
Supersoft wool booties by Hermès are embroidered on the bottom with a rocking horse. They come in a drawstring pouch and are $95; a matching mobile, suitable for carriage or crib, is $215. Both at Hermès stores.
