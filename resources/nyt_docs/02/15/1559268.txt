Re ''Levy in a Tug of War for Land Purchases'' [Feb. 8]: Legislator Allan Binder's attempt to alter this program is an ill-conceived and cynical effort aimed not at reform but squarely at the power of the county executive's office.
Steve Levy's proposal to reform the process was out there for public scrutiny long before the election; he indeed was elected, and he thus should have the chance to implement his ideas. His plan establishes a direct line of accountability right up to his chair in Hauppauge.
Mr. Binder's bill, on the other hand, would shift power from the executive branch to the legislative and establish a so-called ''independent'' real estate department. Such a change in our system of checks and balances is dangerous and unwarranted. Anyone who thinks the Suffolk Legislature can keep politics out of appointing a commissioner to a five-year term is dreaming. Mr. Binder's scheme would further slow the stalled land program.
The issue here is politics, pure and simple. The problems with the land acquisition program surfaced long ago; why, then, did Mr. Binder wait until the opposing party took control of the executive chair to submit his bill? The Legislature should reject Mr. Binder's bill and get on with the business of preserving Suffolk's remaining open space before it disappears.
