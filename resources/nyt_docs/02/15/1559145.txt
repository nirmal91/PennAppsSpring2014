To the Editor:
Your article ''To Some, the Nets Are a Slam Dunk, to Others a Technical Foul'' (Jan. 25) cites plans to bring ''a 19,000-seat arena and other improvements to Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues in Downtown Brooklyn.'' Prospect Heights residents consider the site of this arena for the New Jersey Nets not Downtown Brooklyn but Prospect Heights. That's where Bruce Ratner plans to destroy homes and businesses. Ours is a residential not a business district.
