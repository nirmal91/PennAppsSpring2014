Traditionally, interest and dividends have been taxed at the same rate as ordinary, earned income, but the 2003 law gave investors a big tax break. Qualified dividends, generally those on stocks and stock-based mutual funds and paid after Dec. 31, 2002, are taxed at 15 percent for people in the top brackets and 5 percent for people in the 10 and 15 percent brackets.
The price for this break is a bit of complexity. Investors must keep track of whether dividends are qualified. Those from real estate investment trusts, mutual savings banks and certain mutual funds and foreign corporations generally are not. Mutual funds report this information on the 1099's they send out; brokerage houses may do so, too. For a dividend to qualify, investors need to comply with a complex rule involving a holding period of more than 60 days.
Interest is listed on Lines 1 through 4 of Schedule B. Lines 5 and 6 are for ordinary dividends, including qualified dividends, which are then listed separately on Line 9b of the 1040. That number is then carried to Schedule D, Part IV, for tax computation.
