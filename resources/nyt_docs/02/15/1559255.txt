The Long Island Power Authority imposed a 4.5 percent surcharge on its electric rates Wednesday, citing higher costs for fuel and the electricity it buys from other utilities. The increase means that the average residential customer will pay $4.41 more a month.
The new surcharge will be in addition to an 8.8 percent fuel surcharge imposed last March. Together, they add about $13 a month to the average residential bill.
LIPA said electric bills were expected to rise by 1.4 percent next year but were not expected to increase in 2006.
Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chairman, said in a statement that the utility was projecting revenue of $2.71 billion this year, an increase of about $127.7 million or 5.6 percent over 2003.
Gordian Raacke, the executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a LIPA watchdog group, said the surcharges are nothing more than rate increases and that LIPA should not masquerade them as anything else.
''The bottom line is that each year LIPA reaches deeper and deeper into ratepayers' pockets,'' he said. ''For several years in a row LIPA has imposed rate increases on us that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.''
Mr. Raacke said he would like to see a change in the law to permit LIPA's trustees to be elected so that they could be held ''accountable to the people of Long Island.''
