An article last Sunday about the possibility that a Northern candidate could win the presidential election referred incorrectly in some copies to the last Northerner to have served as president. Vice President Gerald R. Ford, a former congressman from Michigan, became president in 1974 after the resignation of Richard M. Nixon. John F. Kennedy, in 1960, was the most recent Northerner to have won a presidential election.
