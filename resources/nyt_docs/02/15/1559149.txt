To the Editor:
Re ''Happiness, Too, Dances on the Head of a Pin (Coping, by Anemona Hartocollis, Feb. 8), about women who have become pregnant after taking traditional Chinese herbal medicine: I have a similar story. After trying to have kids for three years, I was told me that my hormones were completely out of whack (I was 40) and I could not even get fertility treatment.
I went down to Canal Street and saw Dr. Fu Zhang, who took my pulse and gave me a bag of tea (roots and twigs to brew myself and drink three times a day). Five weeks later, I was pregnant with my first son Tobey (now 2). After Tobey was born, I got pregnant again immediately and had another son, Jake, exactly one year later.
