While I share the distaste for much of today's political process expressed by the ''Marvelettes'' of Orangeburg, S.C., I observe that they sound very much like a group that they may have serious reservations about -- northern white liberals (JoAnn Wypijewski, Feb. 1). In 2000, they, too, demanded higher standards of real commitment to issues of race and class from the Democrats, and many found them wanting. So they voted for Ralph Nader in sufficient numbers to assure the victory of George W. Bush.
It would be a shame if this time around similar thinking led African-Americans to sit at home or cast ''symbolic'' votes.
I would urge the ''M's'' to devote their energy to the ultimate Democratic candidate.
