For everyone who has had too many homogenized coffee drinks from too many coffee shop chains, salvation comes in the form of a funky little respite tucked in at the tail end of downtown Closter.
Feel the tension slide off your body as you walk into this endearingly cramped and narrow space, with its black tin ceiling, mismatched stuffed chairs and walls barely visible beneath this and that (including a framed newspaper from Dec. 8, 1941, a hand-lettered sign declaring ''Loitering Recommended'' and bits of salvaged architectural remnants).
The surprise is how much more there is here than just the shabby chic charm. This relatively recent (about six years old) annex to the 108-year-old M. Rohrs' House of Fine Teas and Coffee on East 85th Street in New York City carries the same superb special blends -- the roast recipes are a carefully guarded secret -- as the original store. Look closely through the big glass jars of ever-popular rugelach (apricot, raspberry, chocolate hazelnut and cinnamon raisin, 60 cents apiece or $11.20 a pound) and you will see some of the original tin coffee bins from the New York shop that are more than 100 years old.
The intensely flavored, elegantly smooth Havana roast is one of the many coffees available daily as a fresh brewed cup ($1.33-$2.17) or as whole beans by the pound ($9.99). On alternating weekends, Hawaiian Kona and Jamaican Blue Mountain take turns as the featured brewed specials (prices range from $3 to $6 a cup).
Local high school students have found a perfect hangout in Rohrs', while coffee lovers travel from near and far to pick up their cup -- or pound -- of joe.
