Diane Keaton
In Nancy Meyers's ''Something's Gotta Give,'' Diane Keaton plays Erica, a divorcée in her mid-50's who has forgotten what love, not to mention sex, feels like. The picture seems more engineered than made, but almost single-handedly, Ms. Keaton saves it.
Striding through the movie in leggy trousers and a series of dazzling white turtlenecks, she is not an aging sex symbol but an ageless one. For one thing, she's prettier than ever. Her skin has a fine luminosity (it's moon glow as opposed to sunshine), and the camera adores the planes of her face as well as its radiant, go-for-broke expressiveness. Ms. Keaton plays neurosis not as an endearing quirk but as an ostrich ballet, a series of unpredictable, flirtatious pirouettes and pliés -- her grace is inexplicable and innate, and her line deliveries take death-defying loops and curves. When Harry, the 60-ish rake played by Jack Nicholson, calls Erica on the fact that she wears those turtlenecks even in summer, she asserts that she's simply always liked them -- even as she fiddles self-consciously with the fabric. Her airy defensiveness is funny in itself, but she also shows a glimmer of uncertainty, as if she's only just now realizing how scratchy and confining her sartorial choices, as well as her life choices, are.
Ms. Keaton is at her best when Erica's jittery feline confidence gives way to vulnerability -- when, after she sleeps with Harry, it dawns on her that parts of herself that she believed had been folded away for good have suddenly been gloriously and dangerously unfurled. Ms. Keaton plays the scene with bold delicacy; Erica's fears and insecurities tumble out, but they're inseparable from her sense of delight and wonder in her newly rediscovered self. Sex, after all, has more to do with the brain than with any other organ. Sometimes getting it to respond requires little more than emerging from your inner turtleneck.
