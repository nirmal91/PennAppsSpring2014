THE S FACTOR  Strip Workouts for Every Woman  By Sheila Kelley  Workman, 241 pp., $15.95.
FOR a few years now, middle American women, at least those who watch ''Oprah'' and ''The View,'' have been perfectly happy finding their inner Demi Moore, or watching others do so. Egging them on have been strip gurus like the actress Sheila Kelley (''L.A. Law,'' ''ER''), who was so taken with stripping after preparing for a role in the movie ''Dancing at the Blue Iguana'' that she opened her own studio, complete with poles. It now boasts a yearlong waiting list.
A book was inevitable. Ms. Kelley recounts her conversion prefilming, a real ''eeeuw'' moment in which she performs at a strip joint for her husband, Richard Schiff (''The West Wing''). He hires Ms. Kelley for a lap dance: ''A perfect moment in a perfect marriage,'' Ms. Kelley says. Forthwith, she installs her very own pole back home, starts teaching her buddies, and voil√†! Bye-bye Yogilates.
I can't tell you about pole dancing. But I can say that performing ''S Factor'' exercises alone is a bit like playing Twister by yourself (you try the Side Leg Peel without inadvertently hurling the book across the room; of course, then you can Cat Crawl over to where it has landed, and stay in character). Ms. Kelley uses a clear vernacular, which is helpful for knowing what to put where. In closing, it must be said that Ms. Kelley often performs lap dances on an empty chair. She says they are good for strengthening the upper arms.
