To the Editor:
Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (Op-Ed, Feb. 10) have a powerful idea, one that has been neglected for a long time -- mainly, I believe, because gay people originally objected (rightly) to being additionally marginalized with the stigma of AIDS.
The voluntary aspect of H.I.V. voluntary counseling and testing really did turn public health logic and practice on its head. But the stigma associated with H.I.V. infection is enormous and the discrimination unforgiving.
Confidentiality is indeed absolutely crucial. But testing will never catch on until there is complete assurance that people who test positive can obtain treatment.
Furthermore, widespread testing is a great opportunity to actively integrate ''prevention'' with ''treatment and care'' because counseling and testing are essential to the working of both. I say, Let's go for it!
