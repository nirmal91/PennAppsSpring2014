The Times's Viv Bernstein selects 10 drivers to look for in the chase for the championship.
1. Ryan Newman  Won a series-high 8 races and 11 poles last season, finishing sixth in the overall points race. Newman just might deliver that first Nascar championship to the open-wheel legend Roger Penske.
2. Matt Kenseth  Consistency brought Kenseth his first title last year, when he posted 25 finishes in the top 10 despite winning only one race.
3. Jimmie Johnson  Would have won the overall championship last season if the new points system  were in place. Finished 90 points behind Kenseth for second.
4. Jeff Gordon  Remains among the elite drivers. Gordon has not finished out of the top 10 in the past 10 seasons and has never gone more than two seasons without a title. He has placed fourth the past two years.
5. Tony Stewart  The 2002 champion, Stewart has finished in the top 10 in points in his five seasons in Nascar's elite series. That shouldn't change this season, either.
6. Dale Earnhardt Jr.  The son of one of Nascar's greatest drivers, Dale Jr. made his first serious challenge for the title last year when he finished third over all with 21 top-10 finishes.
7. Bobby Labonte  Along with Stewart, one of two drivers to deliver championships to Joe Gibbs. Labonte won in 2000, when he set the measure for consistency by running in all but nine laps over the year.
8. Kevin Harvick  Took over Dale Earnhardt's spot in 2001 when he was killed at the Daytona 500 and has quickly become a top competitor. Harvick finished fifth last season.
9. Kurt Busch  Was in the top 10 almost all of last season and as high as No. 2 before  falling to 11th in the final race of the year.
10. Jamie McMurray  The rookie of the year in 2003, McMurray improved as the season went along and had nine top-10 finishes in the second half. He finished 13th over all in the points race.
