To the Editor:
Re ''Kitty, 40 Years Later'' (Feb. 8): Whatever the ultimate truth of the Kitty Genovese murder in terms of how many witnesses failed to get involved, I can speak to the far-reaching positive impact of the original report of that event.
The West 83rd Street Association, New York's third-oldest block association, was created in direct response to Ms. Genovese's murder. Within days of her death, about 60 of us met and vowed that such a situation would never happen here, that we would band together to ''get involved'' as a block.
Although the association has two other purposes (beautifying the block and being involved in the larger community), its paramount issue has been safety and security. Our goal is that neighbors recognize one another, look out for one another, and take action if a situation demands it.
Over the years, some of us have helped foil purse-snatchings and other crimes simply by opening our windows and sticking our heads out when a cry for help is heard (as well as calling 911, which was not an option for New Yorkers in 1964).
It is no coincidence that the number of block and neighborhood associations increased tremendously after the Kitty Genovese murder. While nothing can assuage the pain and grief of her family and friends, they might be comforted by the fact that the lack of involvement of their neighbors turned into a vigilance in many communities that has almost certainly saved lives.
