The Whole Foods Market's wine shop in the Time Warner Center is chockablock with smartly chosen low-priced bottles. Closed Wednesdays, it is open Sundays, making possible a Columbus Circle stop en route to a dinner party. (Few Manhattan stores are open Sundays.)
Consider the 2002 Domaine de Pouy from Gascony ($7.49) and Lingenfelder's 2002 ''Bird-Label'' riesling from the Pfalz, Germany ($12).
