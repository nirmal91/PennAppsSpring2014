Re ''Banks Try to Pave the Way to Online Bill Paying'' (Jan. 18);
People who set up electronic payments to be made just before they are due should remember one caution. Despite the ''electronic'' inferred in ''online bill payment,'' not all payees -- including some that are quite large -- have made arrangements for electronic transfer of funds.
I discovered this recently when I was hit with a late payment fee from a mortgage company I paid through an online service offered by my bank. When I questioned the bank, saying the payment had been scheduled a full week before it was due, it pointed out that this company did not yet offer online fund transfer, and that the time needed for the bank to receive my payment instructions, cut the check and mail it, and for the payee to receive and credit it, was more than the week I allowed.
The bank was happy to run through my list of payees with me and point out which ones were paid electronically and which were not. This rundown helps to ensure that each scheduled payment is completed far enough in advance to avoid problems.
