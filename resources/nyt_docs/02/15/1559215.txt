No sooner did the Postal Service announce last week that a mail-sorting plant in Hamilton, which was contaminated with anthrax in October 2001, was clear of the poison after being fumigated with chlorine gas than it had to investigate concerns that arose at a Williamstown site. On Tuesday, the Williamstown post office was shut down most of the day after a postal worker discovered grayish-white powder on her sweater and a second worker complained of a scratchy throat and itchy eyes.
The source of the substance was not determined, but Postal Inspector Anthony Esposito later said he believed it was a commercial product that broke in the mail, possible a powdered energy drink. The post office reopened Wednesday.
