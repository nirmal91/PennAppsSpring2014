In 1784, when Thomas Jefferson arrived in Paris to help represent the fledgling American republic, one of his missions was to locate a sculptor to create a statue of George Washington. Jefferson recommended Jean-Antoine Houdon: ''I find that a Monsieur Houdon of this place possesses the reputation of being the first statuary in the world.'' Houdon (1741-1828) was already widely recognized as the greatest European sculptor of his age. His remarkable career, which spanned the Enlightenment, both the American and the French revolutions, and the Directory and the Napoleonic era in France, is the subject of the essays by Anne L. Poulet, an emeritus curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and others in JEAN-ANTOINE HOUDON: Sculptor of the Enlightenment (University of Chicago, $85). They detail Houdon's artistic development and provide insights into his working methods and his relationships with his subjects, a group that included Moli√®re, Diderot, Voltaire, Franklin and Napoleon. Houdon was obsessive in his attention to muscle and bone structure, using calipers to measure his sitters' features. He could do teeth, the pupils of the eyes, soft dimples, even tears; details that, two centuries later, still catch the breath. In 1783, a critic said of Houdon's portrait busts of contemporary celebrities: ''M. Houdon lacks only the means to make his portraits speak, since, as for likeness, he lacks nothing.''
