O'Connell Elementary School in Hartford reopened last Monday, a few days after more than 80 students at the school had called in sick and about 40 others went home early with nausea and vomiting.
Dr. Marion H. Martinez, East Hartford's superintendent of schools, said officials first became aware of the illness on Feb. 5 and had planned to close O'Connell the next day. But the entire school system was shut down because of inclement weather.
After the school was sprayed with an antiseptic last weekend, it reopened Monday with 44 students absent and 47 going home early.
Baker Salsbury, the town's director of health and social services, said those who became ill appeared to have an intestinal virus, ''based on the severity and the extent to which it has been communicated.''
Mr. Salsbury said Tuesday that he thought the illness was ''winding down,'' but that about 30 students were still affected.
As of the middle of last week, East Hartford officials were still awaiting test results to see what might have led to a large number of students and some faculty and staff members becoming ill.
The town's health department, in conjunction with the state's department of public health, was testing students' stool samples. The department was also investigating whether the illness was introduced through food served at the school.
Mr. Salsbury said the origin may never be determined.
''It is conceivable that it was introduced by a person who picked it up somewhere else, and whose next stop was school,'' he said.
The town's health department is also mailing educational and safety materials to students' homes.
