In the return they filed, the Taxpayers were not liable for the alternative minimum tax, which was originally intended to prevent the rich from whittling down their taxes excessively but is increasingly snaring middle-class people.
The family would have had to include this form if they had filed one return claiming five exemptions, and the parents had sold the appreciated stock used to pay for Cyril's college costs themselves. Their A.M.T. liability would have increased their taxes by $190 (Line 35).
State and local income and real estate taxes (Line 3) are not deductible in calculating the alternative minimum tax, so people in high-tax areas are at risk, as are those who claim depreciation or exercise incentive stock options. Claiming exemptions for several children can also lead to liability for this tax.
The I.R.S. expects people to calculate both the regular tax and the A.M.T. and pay whichever is higher, but taxpayers are often unaware of the alternative tax until they get a notice that they owe it -- plus penalties for late payment.
