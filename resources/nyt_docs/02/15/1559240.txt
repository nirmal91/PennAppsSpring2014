Three police officers interrupted a shooting on a Bronx sidewalk yesterday morning, returning fire and wounding the gunman, the police said.
The shooting occurred at 8:07 a.m. in front of 946 Hoe Avenue, near Southern Boulevard.
When the officers responded to a call from a dispatcher, they found one man on the sidewalk, bleeding from gunfire, and a second man holding a gun, the police said.
Witnesses said a woman had called out a window for the gunman to stop, and he turned and fired at her but missed. After the three officers got out of their unmarked car, he fired at them, and they dived for cover, with one officer hurting his hand, the police said.
The officers returned fire, hitting the gunman in the chest three times. None of the officers was struck.
Both the gunman and the other man, neither of whose names were released, were taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in serious condition, the authorities said.
A box of ammunition, found on the hood of a parked car, and two pistols were recovered from the scene of the shooting, the police said.
