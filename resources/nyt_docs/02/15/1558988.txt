To the Editor:
While, sadly, Balanchine's Broadway choreography is largely lost [''George Balanchine, Musical Comedian?'' by Matthew Gurewitsch, Jan. 18], there has been a major effort to document his activity in the commercial world in other ways.
The George Balanchine Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to Mr. Balanchine's work, conducted a huge research project from 1999 to 2002, ''Popular Balanchine,'' to preserve what information remains about his choreography for the popular stage and screen. More than 40 researchers, many of them prominent dance historians, compiled dossiers on 40 such works. In aggregate, they constitute a unique archive of primary source materials on a major period in the history of American musical theater.
Balanchine did not look down on his work for the popular stage and screen. It can certainly be argued that no appraisal of his multifaceted achievement, like the Balanchine 100 celebration now under way at Lincoln Center, would be complete without some allusion to his showman side.
