More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
The pram preferred by Hollywood parents is a $2,500 model by Silver Cross. The company now offers an upright stroller for less conspicuous consumers. The sporty Camden model is just $239 at Albee in Manhattan, (212) 662-5740.
