One of the last active manufacturing sites in SoHo has been reborn as a condominium with six lofts selling for $4.25 million to $6.75 million.
The four-story structure, at 73 Wooster Street, opened in 1929 as a parking garage and later housed a cardboard box manufacturer until the mid-1990's. In 1997 Chelsfield U.S.A., a subsidiary of Chelsfield P.L.C. of London, bought the vacant tan brick building, which runs to West Broadway.
In a conversion that the developer said cost more than $30 million, the site has been reshaped into four 4,300-square-foot apartments and two 5,000-square-foot penthouses. All have 14.5-foot ceilings, and each penthouse has a greenhouse and a terrace.
The conversion, designed by SLCE Architects, removed part of the middle of the building to allow more light into the units. ''Height and light are two of the more important features of lofts,'' said Peter Armstrong, president of Chelsfield USA, which converted the Westbury Hotel, Madison Avenue and 69th Street, to 47 condos.
Sales began at 73 Wooster Street a week ago, and there is a contract out on one loft, said Karen Mansour of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing Group.
