Many taxpayers are reluctant to claim a home-office deduction because it has long been considered an audit flag. But tax professionals say people who are entitled to this deduction should take it. To qualify, the portion of the house claimed must be used regularly and exclusively for business, and the office must be essential to the conduct of the business.
Samuel Taxpayer uses one room of his home as an office to meet clients and handle necessary administrative work for his consulting practice. The size of that room (Line 1) amounts to 10 percent of his home (Line 3), so he can deduct that portion of the expenses of maintaining his home (Lines 9 through 21, Column B). All the expenses pertaining directly to the office (Lines 9 through 21, Column A) are deductible.
He can depreciate the part of the home used for the office. That comes to $641 (Line 30). If he sells the home later, depreciation claimed earlier, but not other expenses, will be recaptured and taxed at 25 percent.The total deduction for his home office is $3,651 (Line 34).
