At the height of the chimerical quest for period authenticity in the 1970's and 80's, Bach seemed to be virtually off limits for any pianist not named Glenn Gould. (Gould was evidently exempt because of his ''harpsichordistic'' style and his sheer magnificent looniness.) The harpsichord, reborn after two centuries, ruled. Now so many excellent pianists have returned to Bach that the harpsichord can again seem endangered, at least for solo purposes.
So it came as a surprise recently to find three varied releases of Bach on the harpsichord in a single box of records from the California distributor Harmonia Mundi U.S.A. The outpouring seemed a throwback of sorts to those heady days of early-music zealotry. Yet in some ways, it proves better than a throwback, because early-music performance, like once cherished dogma, has loosened up considerably over the years.
Perhaps the best example here is a probing new recording of the ''Goldberg'' Variations by the French Bach specialist Pierre Hanta√Ø, on Mirare. It may be said to supersede his 1993 version of the work on Opus 111, fine as that was. The new reading has more freedom in tempo, in melodic embellishment and in spirit generally.
Another French player (and conductor) of note, Christophe Rousset, offers splendid accounts of the English Suites on two CD's from Ambroisie. The movements rooted in dance convey an irresistible lilt and propulsiveness, and Mr. Rousset's virtuosity is everywhere a delight.
But the best introduction for anyone coming fresh to Bach on the harpsichord is ''Per Cembalo Solo,'' a wide-ranging album by Richard Egarr, of Britain, on Harmonia Mundi France. It's a scintillating hodgepodge, larded with concertos (Bach's ''Italian Concerto'' and arrangements of Vivaldi) and fantasies and fugues (including the great ''Chromatic'' Fantasy and Fugue), imaginatively interpreted.
