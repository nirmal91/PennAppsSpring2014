CRAZY IN THE KITCHEN
Food, Feuds, and Forgiveness
in an Italian American Family.
By Louise DeSalvo.
Bloomsbury, $24.95.
Through the intimate detail of her life in food, the scholar Louise DeSalvo embarks on a journey to discover the story of her immigrant family -- and her role in that story. In ''Crazy in the Kitchen,'' De Salvo sifts through the different kitchens kept by the women of her family -- three generations of women making a life in the New Jersey suburbs -- unraveling the complications between daughter and mother, mother and grandmother. She excavates the layers of her past through the pastas she now makes by hand, the memory of the rustic peasant bread her grandmother labored over amid the turmoil and conflict of her stepdaughter's kitchen, and the hunger that drove her grandparents from southern Italy. Her stories -- of her grandmother who never learned English and came from Puglia in an arranged marriage, of her mother, who never showed her the affection she craved, of the literal and figurative starvation that plagued her family -- illuminate the difficulties of reconciling past and present, the life each of them left and the traditions to which each generation returns. DeSalvo, nearly 60 years old by the end of her narrative, realizes that her obsession with food is ''my futile way of dealing with the fact that someday I am going to die.'' But through recording the past, through her visits to the countryside where her grandparents were born, through the peace she makes with her mother and grandmother (both now dead), DeSalvo celebrates the table of her ancestors by savoring her own rediscovered history.
