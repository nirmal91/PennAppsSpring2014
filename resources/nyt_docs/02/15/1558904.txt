I must commend W. Todd Bassett for his fiscal restraint as the leader of a major charitable organization (The Way We Live Now, Deborah Solomon, Feb. 1). This said, I do take exception to his proposed use of the windfall $1.5 billion bequest. While one cannot argue that food for the soul is necessary, food for the body is more so.
