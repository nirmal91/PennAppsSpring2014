Samuel Taxpayer, like most other self-employed people, must file Schedule C. So do people who earn sideline income on which taxes are not withheld.
Samuel reported gross receipts of $84,000 (Line 7) and expenses totaling $20,607 (Line 28). Among the expenses, detailed in Part II, was $3,250 (Line 13) for a notebook computer and peripherals. Rather than depreciate it over five years, he chose to deduct the cost all at once under Section 179. Samuel also deducted $3,651 for business use of his home (Line 30), because his office is there.
One of the big breaks of the 2003 tax law was liberalized depreciation for small businesses. Although Samuel did not need to make big equipment purchases, many small businesses do, and they are allowed to deduct up to $100,000, compared with a maximum of $25,000 under previous law. In addition, the law provides for 50 percent bonus depreciation for property bought and placed into service after May 5, 2003, and before Jan. 1, 2005. Expense deductions cannot exceed both spouses' total active business income for the year.
