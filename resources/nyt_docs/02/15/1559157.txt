The Taxpayers gave appreciated stock in I.B.M. and Citigroup to their son, Cyril, a college freshman. They had bought it years ago to save for his education. He sold it and paid his first semester's costs with the proceeds. He also earned $4,500 in a summer job, but both the earnings and the capital gains are tax-free to him because he gets the benefit of a single person's standard deduction, and, as a full-time student, he can claim a Hope credit, which offsets the income tax of $678 that would otherwise have been due. (If the parents had claimed Cyril as a deduction, they would not have qualified for the Hope credit because the family income is too high.) And he will get a refund of $450 for taxes withheld from his summer job.
The strategy results in tax savings of $1,609 for the Taxpayers. If the parents had sold the stock and claimed Cyril on their return, they would have owed taxes of $27,348. Although their capital gains rate would be 15 percent under regular tax rules or those for the alternative minimum tax, the higher adjusted gross income and loss of personal exemptions and of deductions for state and local taxes would have led to an A.M.T. liability, that would have cost an extra $190.
