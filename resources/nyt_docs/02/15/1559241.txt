PRESIDENT BUSH showed up in a gray Army windbreaker. Prince Charles was decked out in desert camouflage and boots. Tony Blair was more casual, in jeans and an open-neck shirt.
No, it wasn't Fashion Week. It was Iraq: where politicians go to see and be seen. At least 150 members of Congress have made the trip, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Tom DeLay, the House majority leader.
Of course, nothing is new about politicians visiting the front lines during a war, and many who have traveled to Iraq had real reasons -- like wanting to assess the war's progress firsthand.
But the politics that often underlie these trips were out front last week when six governors -- including George E. Pataki of New York -- dropped in. No sooner had they arrived than the Bush-Cheney campaign alerted reporters, via e-mail, about scheduled television appearances by Governor Pataki, a Republican, to discuss his impressions of the war.
Similarly, a few months back, a group of Republican senators toured Iraq and Afghanistan, and lauded the Bush administration's efforts on their return.
For their part, Democratic senators quickly complained that they had been denied access to an Air Force plane to go and assess the situation themselves.
The British, they pointed out, had offered them a plane. ''If Britain can offer United States senators an airplane, you would think the United States government could do so as well,'' said Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate.
