Because of an editing error, the What's Doing column on Jan. 25, about Sun Valley, Idaho, reversed the locations of the River Run and Warm Springs base areas of the Sun Valley ski resort. River Run is at the south end of the town, and Warm Springs at the north end. A map with the column mislabeled the body of water that runs parallel to Warm Springs Road. It is Warm Springs Creek; Big Wood River, unlabeled on the map, runs north and south parallel to Route 75.
