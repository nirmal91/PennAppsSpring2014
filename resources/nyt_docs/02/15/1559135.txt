The designer Kate Spade gave a sneak preview last week of the uniforms she has created for Song, the low-fare operation of Delta Air Lines.
The charcoal gray and lime green outfits for male and female flight attendants were modeled at a cocktail party at Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan during Fashion Week, which Song helped sponsor.
But the uniforms might not be seen by as many passengers as Song once expected. This month, Song said it would eliminate service at Washington Dulles Airport in April, and it is pulling back on its aggressive expansion plans at Kennedy Airport in New York.
Delta is in the midst of a companywide reassessment, aimed at keeping a lid on costs, and has said it is rethinking what it wants Song to be.
Nonetheless, the uniforms will be coming down Song's aisles on March 31, a spokeswoman for Song said.
