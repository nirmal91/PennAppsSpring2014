JOHN BUCHAN
The Presbyterian Cavalier.
By Andrew Lownie.
Godine, paper, $18.95.
Called by one of his contemporaries ''one of the most versatile men of his time,'' John Buchan (1875-1940) had become a household name in Britain by the end of World War I. He was best known as a writer of ''shockers,'' as he called them, the prototypes of the modern spy thriller (his most famous shocker, ''The Thirty-Nine Steps'' was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935). However, his popular thrillers were only a small portion of Buchan's 100 or so books of biography, history, poetry, essays and historical romance. A man of formidable ambition, boundless energy and intellectual curiosity, Buchan wrote on the side while working at a diverse series of professions of increasing prominence and influence -- lawyer, publisher, war correspondent, member of the army's Intelligence Corps, deputy chairman of the Reuters news agency, Tory member of Parliament and governor general of Canada. Personally, even his own son William found him ''a mysterious man'' who ''eluded everybody.'' In his thorough and lucid biography, Andrew Lownie, a Scottish journalist and editor of several collections of Buchan's stories and poetry, sympathetically evokes this ''highly complex and private man who may not always himself have understood his own motivations and abilities.'' Buchan's heroes, men of ratiocination and action, reason and romance, duty and adventure, Lownie maintains, best reveal and imaginatively reconcile the contradictions that both impelled and thwarted Buchan during his lifetime.
