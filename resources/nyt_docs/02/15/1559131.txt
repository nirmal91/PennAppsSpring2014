The Dow Jones industrial average fell on four days last week and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped on three. But the two market gauges still eked out small gains for the week, thanks to Alan Greenspan. The Nasdaq composite index, which fell on three days, was not as lucky.
Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave investors and the market a lift on Wednesday when he said in Congressional testimony that the central bank would be patient in raising interest rates and that it was forecasting brisk economic growth this year.
His impetus was enough to push the Dow to its highest close since June 2001, while the S.&amp;P. had its best close since March 2002.
The Dow, led by Walt Disney and Alcoa, climbed 34.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,627.85. The S.&amp;P. 500 inched up 3.05 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,145.81. But the Nasdaq, held back by declines in Comcast and Juniper Networks, fell 10.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2.053.56.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 4.04 percent from 4.08 percent a week earlier.
