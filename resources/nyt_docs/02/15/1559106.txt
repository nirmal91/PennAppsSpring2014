The annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which was held in the city last week, brought a level of dog primping that would make most owners blush. But Alice Moss, who runs Doggie Diva, a canine day care service on the Lower East Side, barely batted an eye. She simply went about her daily routine -- namely, driving around the city picking up dogs in a white stretch limo.
''It was really my husband's idea,'' said Ms. Moss, a dog lover whose eyes widen when she speaks about her clients. ''We needed more space to pick up the dogs, and Alan said, 'What about a limousine?' I said, 'It's brilliant!'''
Last spring, the couple garaged their Ford Windstar and began making rounds in the limo. They set out at 6:30 a.m. and chauffeur about 10 dogs, picking them up at their homes and returning them at night. A pink sign reading ''Doggie Diva'' adorns the side of the limo. It always gets a reaction.
''Some people hate it,'' Mr. Moss said. ''They say that limos aren't for dogs. And for a while people thought we were that rapper. What's his name? Snoop Doggy Dogg.''
''Alan had women flashing him their breasts,'' Ms. Moss said.
Dog owners are generally more receptive. ''The limo is genius,'' said Pippa Cohen, who lives on the Upper East Side and has been using the service since August for her dog, Violet, a mutt she describes as a queen. ''My dog definitely knows what's going on,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''She likes to sit in the front seat.''
While people who see a dog being dropped off often inquire if the dog is famous, Ms. Moss says being picked up is only $5 to $15 more than if an owner brings a dog in. And anyway, the dogs prefer the limo.
''They don't understand luxury like we do, but they sense the comfort,'' like cushy carpeting and plenty of legroom, Ms. Moss said. Mr. Moss added, ''Of course, the bar is off limits.''
