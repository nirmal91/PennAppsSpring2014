The St. Basil Academy in Garrison, a Greek Orthodox home for troubled children, received a reprieve recently when the New York State Office of Children and Family Services told the home it would not be closed. It had been denied certification when it applied for a license after it was found to be operating without one, and had originally been told to stop caring for children by the end of January.
Pending an appeal of the license denial, St. Basil will still be allowed to care for the two dozen children who live there. With the children staying in Garrison until the appeal process runs its course, they will continue to attend public school in the Garrison school district.
The state education commissioner made a temporary ruling last August holding the Garrison public schools responsible for educating the children of St. Basil's, a decision the district protested, saying the children were not residents of Garrison. In light of the denial of St. Basil's application for licensing, the district filed an appeal to the State Education Department that has yet to be resolved. Dr. Ellen Bergman, superintendent of the Garrison schools, said the presence of St. Basil students continued to put a financial strain on the small district, with almost $750,000 spent on their education between this school year and what is budgeted for next year.
