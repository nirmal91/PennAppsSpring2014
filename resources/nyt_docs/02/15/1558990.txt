To the Editor:
Terrence Rafferty's otherwise insightful and profound article about Bernardo Bertolucci [''For Bertolucci, the Subject Is Sex,'' Feb. 1] blurs the distinction between an artist's life and his work. Surely an artist's interests and struggles influence the work. But claiming that all Bertolucci has been trying to do ''is lose his virginity again and again'' is an untoward, overgeneralized assertion about Bertolucci the man.
Instead, why not see his creativity as a result of his exploration of unconscious struggles that inform his distinctive film style: timeless, dreamlike, stunning images that reflect the forbidden sexuality of his characters? Beyond the sexual and political surface themes, ''The Dreamers'' portrays the conflict the French twins have to face to individuate rather than continue in their enmeshment.
