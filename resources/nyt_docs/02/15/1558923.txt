Johnny Depp
Johnny Depp's performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' accomplishes a rare feat. It's a vivacious, garrulous character turn that manages not to wear on the audience and not to inhibit the movie's momentum.
Not only does Mr. Depp, as the star, keep the picture together; he also demonstrates the grace and graciousness that are ordinarily the province of the able supporting player. Woozy and contemplative -- there actually appears to be a stray thought rattling around in the back of Sparrow's dreadlocked head -- he finds a generous groove and stays knee-deep in it. At no point does he upstage the other actors in the film; he may be the Ernie Isley of movie actors.
Even when he's at the center of the picture -- which is often, what with all that mascara and braiding, all those gargled consonants -- Mr. Depp's patience and concentration lend him the aura of an ensemble member. As a result, his cheeky attentiveness takes on the color of devilish authority. He's so rooted in the liquor-soaked Sparrow that he locates the reality in a character audiences might otherwise dismiss as a flight of fancy. He steals a movie that's a treasure-trove of commotion.
