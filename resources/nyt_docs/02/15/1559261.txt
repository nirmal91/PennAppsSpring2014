Golf lovers in eastern Connecticut will know by the end of the month whether they can look forward to a local Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament in October.
Members of the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce and officials from a North Carolina sports marketing firm that would operate the event said that within the next three weeks they must find a title sponsor to provide at least $1 million in order to play host to a tournament this fall at Pautipaug Country Club in Sprague.
The L.P.G.A. completes its 2004 tournament schedule by March 1.
''It will happen, but maybe not for '04,'' David Pugliese, a member of the Chamber of Commerce's board of directors, said. ''But it will definitely happen for '05.''
Mr. Pugliese said he and other chamber members had already raised $1 million in local sponsorships for the event.
Bill Futterer, the managing member of the sports marketing firm PSE-3 in Raleigh, N.C., said there were eight to 10 prospects for title sponsors. He said he was uncertain whether any of them could make such a large financial commitment quickly enough to ensure a tournament for this year, however.
Mark O'Neil, who manages Pautipaug Country Club for the Essex Golf Group, said a professional women's tournament would be a major economic advantage for the club and region.
''Pautipaug is a hidden gem,'' he said of the private club situated in a tiny community north of Norwich. ''This is a super opportunity to showcase the club and the area.''
Mr. Pugliese said the tournament would last three or four days, be nationally televised and involve 130 to 140 players. Similar tournaments provide a $7 million to $10 million economic increase for their regions, he said.
''There are hundreds of participants before you even get to the spectators,'' he said. ''We are very excited. It will definitely put this region on the map.''
