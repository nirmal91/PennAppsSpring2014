To the Editor:
''Officials Say Mob Stole $200 Million Using Phone Bills'' (front page, Feb. 11) describes a sophisticated scheme by the mob to defraud millions of consumers using the very simple method of putting a believable and official-looking item on the monthly bill from the local telephone company.
It worked primarily because we got used to being billed that way for years by various federal and state authorities, who used the telephone companies as bill collectors of the fees and taxes that legislators wanted to hide.
