To the Sports Editor:
Teresa Weatherspoon will be missed in New York. She is a wonderful athlete and a true sportswoman. She is a role model to all athletes, especially the young. A quotation by the Liberty's general manager, Carol Blazejowski, ''It was purely business,'' points out the problems with professional and now even college sports. No matter whom Weatherspoon plays for (she signed with the Los Angeles Sparks), her fans will be there to watch her play her game, which is infused with her love of basketball.
