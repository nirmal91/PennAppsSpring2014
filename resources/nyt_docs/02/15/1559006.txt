More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
A T-shirt from Vintage Disney ($39 at Gatsbys, in Great Barrington, Mass., 413-528-9455) looks sweet with an apple green cashmere cardigan and matching pants ($250 for the set at Ralph Lauren Baby Store in Manhattan, 212-434-8099). The navy cashmere dress is $130 at Cadeau in Manhattan, (212) 994-1801.
