To the Editor:
Your article about Kitty Genovese perpetuates the myth about callous, uncaring New Yorkers that The Times created 40 years ago.
My father, Bernard Titowsky, owned the Austin Book Shop on Austin Street in Kew Gardens. The initial attack occurred in front of his store. Sometimes people assumed that he was one of the 38 witnesses, although we lived several blocks away and saw and heard nothing.
Every few years, reporters came to his store in search of a quote to use in a story about an anniversary of this tragedy. He rarely obliged them. They haven't gotten it right yet, he told me, and they probably never will.
