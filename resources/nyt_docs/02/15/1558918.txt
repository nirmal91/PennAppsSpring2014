Naomi Watts
As Cristina Peck, the heroine of Alejandro González Iñárritu's bruising ''21 Grams,'' Naomi Watts proves herself to be the most eloquent sufferer in American movies since Lillian Gish in the silent era: she's a 21st-century orphan of the storm. When Cristina loses her husband and daughters in an accident, she loses her emotional bearings at the same time, swiftly and totally. She self-medicates with drink and drugs and begins to shrink from other people. Many of Ms. Watts's scenes find her alone and silent, staring dully at the nothing that her world has become.
This is a terrifying and weirdly lyrical portrait of despair. That it never becomes monotonous is a tribute both to Mr. González Iñárritu's sensitive direction and -- especially -- to the resourcefulness of Ms. Watts's imagination. Cristina's grief, absolute though it is, nevertheless seems to change its texture in every scene, like a dark surface that catches the light differently at different times of day.
The fractured chronological scheme of ''21 Grams'' deprives the performances of anything like a conventional arc, the inexorable progression of dramatic intensity that actors work so hard to achieve. Ms. Watts, though, actually appears to benefit from the film's collapsing of time: the quick, startling juxtapositions of her character's pre- and post-disaster selves reveal an essential continuity of personality -- the oddly heartening truth that a core of identity can survive even the most apparently annihilating shock.
Here, as in her 2001 film ''Mulholland Drive,'' Naomi Watts displays an almost freakish absence of vanity; she's not afraid to look, in ordinary terms, awful. Her face has a mysterious property, though: it's pretty when she's happy, but when she's miserable it's beautiful.
