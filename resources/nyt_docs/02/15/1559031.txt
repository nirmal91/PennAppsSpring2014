More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
Silver-on-velvet bracelets by Jeanine Payer ($125 at Fragments in Manhattan, 212-334-9588) are engraved with scraps of poetry by Shakespeare and J. M. Barrie and others. The sentiments may make some adults roll their eyes, but not a misty new mom.
