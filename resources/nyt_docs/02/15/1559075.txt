To the Editor:
In ''The Met in the Era of the Master Juggler'' (Critic's Notebook, Feb. 10), John Rockwell portrays Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who is retiring in 2006, as a ''hard-nosed administrator'' who can ''terrorize his underlings.''
I can testify that while Joe Volpe at times may be a hard taskmaster, his intent is always to make sure his staff members are living up to their full potential and maintaining the high standards of this great institution. His bark is far worse than his bite.
Joe has always shown great compassion toward company members, particularly when they were going through personal difficulties or were in need of help or advice in doing their jobs.
Mr. Rockwell says that ''on some basic level,'' Joe's staff members respect him. In fact, they have tremendous respect for him, his management style and his accomplishments.
