More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
Babies need manicures, too. The Children's Kit from Tweezerman has an enamel-coated nail clipper, enamel-coated scissors, a soft emery board and a soft-bristle nail brush; $24 at www.tweezerman.com.
