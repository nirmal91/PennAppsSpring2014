To the Editor:
''The Weight of the World on Our Shoulders'' (On the Contrary, Feb. 1) described how most of the world struggles to achieve reliably growing economies like that of the United States.
Not mentioned, however, was the role of fraud, cronyism, theft, bribery and the many other embodiments of greed from which countries suffer. These factors must be a drag on various countries' economies, and can cause reluctance to invest in these nations.
Without the American culture of a strong legal system and effective prosecutions, we would be in the same mess. We must cheer on the efforts of American regulators, prosecutors, and judges to shackle the big players who are daily taking billions from our economy -- that is, from our pockets.
Raising the odds of these megabarons being caught would be a great investment toward ''building value,'' a concept the barons themselves regularly espouse.
