To the Editor:
I find ''Found: A Smoking Gun,'' by William Safire (column, Feb. 11), rather odd. He argues that the electronic document recently discovered in Iraq proves that a ''clear link existed between world terror and Saddam'' and cites as support your Feb. 9 front-page article ''U.S. Says Files Seek Qaeda Aid in Iraq Conflict.''
But that article explicitly noted that the document ''does not speak to the debate about whether there was a Qaeda presence in Iraq during the Saddam Hussein era, nor is there any mention of a collaboration with Hussein loyalists.''
Further, the article indicates that the document is a plea for Al Qaeda's assistance. In short, not only does the document fail to establish a prewar connection between Saddam Hussein and world terrorism, but it also suggests that current links between Iraqi insurgents and Al Qaeda may be rather weak and provisional.
