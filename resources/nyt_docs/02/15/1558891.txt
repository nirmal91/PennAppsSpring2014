CHEAPER CAT -- A new high-speed ferry service, the Bahamas Florida Express, links Fort Lauderdale with Grand Bahama Island.

A $5 discount for online reservations means that the lowest rate is $99 round trip, for Tuesday departures. Port charges and taxes are extra. The 320-foot vessel, called the Cat, carries up to 900 passengers. Information: (866) 313-3779 or visit www.ferrybahamas.com.
