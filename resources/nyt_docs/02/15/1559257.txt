The Navy has agreed to keep 250 houses and apartments in the Mitchel Field and Mitchel Manor military housing complex, along with a medical clinic, commissary and post exchange, reversing its earlier decision to sell off the properties by October 2006.
Nearly 1,200 active-duty military personnel and their families live at Mitchel Field, in East Garden City, and Mitchel Manor, in East Meadow. The proposed sale, part of a larger effort by the Navy to sell off military housing in its Northeastern region, from Maine to New Jersey, would have forced residents into the tight private rental market in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens. Veterans who are eligible to use the commissary and post exchange would have had to travel to Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn to buy the groceries and clothing at a discount.
Residents who wanted to save the housing enlisted the help of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Representatives Tim Bishop, Steve Israel, Peter King and Carolyn McCarthy.
The New York delegation met with Gordon England, the secretary of the Navy, on Wednesday, and Senator Clinton said that the Navy had not made it clear whether it would build new housing or refurbish existing units. She said that a private developer, to be selected by the Navy, would do the work, and that the Navy and the developer would jointly determine where construction would take place.
