A 19-year-old man delivering Chinese food to a Queens apartment on Friday night was assaulted and killed, and his body left in a park just north of John F. Kennedy Airport, the police said last night.
Two 16-year-old boys were charged in the case with murder, robbery and tampering with evidence.
Huang Chen, an employee of the Ming Garden restaurant at 134-14 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in Springfield Gardens died from a blow to his head and at least two stab wounds to his chest, the authorities said.
Investigators said they believed that attack took place inside the apartment where the victim was called for a delivery order, arriving about 10 p.m. Friday. They said one of the two boys under arrest last night, Nayquan Miller, lived in the apartment, for which the police gave an address of 245-39 127th Avenue.
Mr. Miller was arrested with Charles Bryant, of 245-39 147th Drive. Investigators said blood was found inside Mr. Miller's apartment even though the two 16-year-old boys had tried to clean it up, adding evidence tampering to the charges they face.
The body was found about 8:45 a.m. yesterday inside Brookville Park, near the intersection of Brookville Boulevard and 147th Avenue. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
