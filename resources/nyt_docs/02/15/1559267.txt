With Rutgers unbeaten at home this season, Saturday night's game against No. 2 Connecticut had the buzz of a special night. Some students even unfurled a poster-size reprint of a newspaper depicting the forlorn UConn team that lost here last season, to Villanova in the Big East tournament.
''I don't know if they knew it or not, but we kind of used that as motivation,'' UConn's Barbara Turner said.
It was clear there would be no upset this time. Dominating from the start, UConn crushed Rutgers, 66-43.
Rutgers misfired on its first eight shots, falling behind by 8-0. Dawn McCullouch finally converted a short jumper 5 minutes 1 second into the game, but the Scarlet Knights missed their next 10 shots. UConn (20-2, 10-1 Big East) led by 21-2 before McCullouch made a layup with 8:01 remaining in the half.
Rutgers's deficit grew to 34-10 at halftime. The Scarlet Knights (14-9, 6-5) needed a layup by Aquisha Cahoe with 27 seconds left in the half to avoid allowing the Huskies to set a team record; UConn held St. John's to 9 points in a half on Dec. 4, 2001.
Turner finished with a career-high 27 points.
''We were anxious,'' Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer said, trying to explain why her team was outrebounded, 48-22, and shot just 14.8 percent in one half. ''I wouldn't say scared. I would say hyped. That's unfortunate, because sometimes when you're hyped you become somewhat paralyzed.''
The Huskies have won nine straight games since losing twice in a four-game stretch.
TEXAS 51, COLORADO 45
Stacy Stephens had 13 points and 11 rebounds, Tiffany Jackson hit a layup with 90 seconds left and top-ranked Texas held off No. 12 Colorado in Boulder, Colo.
Jackson added 10 points and 11 rebounds for Texas (23-2, 11-1 Big 12), which won its ninth straight despite shooting a season-low 26 percent. Randie Wirt and Anna Nedovic each had 10 points for Colorado (19-4, 8-3), which shot 32 percent and had 18 turnovers. (AP)
DUKE 89, NORTH CAROLINA 79
Alana Beard scored 31 points and the reserve Vicki Krapohl added a career-high 20 to lead No. 4 Duke to a victory at No. 15 North Carolina.
Duke (20-3, 11-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) shot 48 percent over all and was 12 for 23 from 3-point range in reaching 20 victories for the seventh straight season.
