To the Editor:
In his review of books attacking American foreign policy, Serge Schmemann finds it ''difficult to explain the level of loathing that the junior Bush and his government have achieved among otherwise rational liberals.'' Let me help him out. The reasons go beyond foreign policy. Bush campaigned as a moderate; even so, he lost the popular vote and became president under deeply divisive circumstances. Yet without anything resembling a mandate he has moved aggressively to reshape American society for the benefit of corporate plutocrats and fundamentalist Christians. We urban, secular non-businesspeople from ''blue'' states have watched Bush and company, with their winner-take-all mentality, take a wrecking ball to everything that makes our lives livable, from civil liberties, environmental protection and labor rights to a federal tax structure capable of supporting Social Security and Medicare.
Still, Bush opponents should keep their loathing in perspective. America's rightward march did not begin with George W. Bush, and simply beating him in November will not solve our problems -- tempting as it may be to think so.
