To the Editor:
While it can be argued that pharmaceutical companies are prone to promote their new drugs to treat schizophrenia, the examples offered in ''Making Drugs, Shaping the Rules'' (Feb. 1) are scarcely remarkable.
Indeed, study findings support the improved efficacy of the newer drugs. Furthermore, the stipends or honorariums provided to various experts to present the often complicated indications and workings of these drugs do not appear excessive.
Lectures, presentations and forums about new drugs are valuable to health care professionals, whose busy schedules often keep them from otherwise learning such crucial information.
