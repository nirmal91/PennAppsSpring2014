To the Sports Editor:
In his ''On Baseball'' column, ''M.L.B. Needs to Play Tough for World Cup'' (Feb. 10), Murray Chass writes that ''M.L.B. would be justified in unilaterally swatting aside impediments to a World Cup'' and that ''one of the hurdles that has to be cleared is drug testing.''
I strongly object to Chass's premise that ''just because it'' -- strict testing -- ''is done for the Olympics doesn't mean it has to be done for everything and everyone else,'' that the test results of a World Cup should not jeopardize the players' major league status. Another way, he says, would be to ignore the International Baseball Federation and ''tell Aldo Notari of Italy to take his bats and balls and stage his own event.''
Drug-testing parameters in sports should apply to all; World Cup players who test positive should not be allowed to play. What the planned World Cup does not need is the strong-armed approach Chass has suggested. For the event to come close to achieving the stature of soccer's huge success, it must have the support and involvement of countries that do not like to be bullied by the United States. Otherwise, baseball's World Cup will be just like our World Series classic, in name only.
