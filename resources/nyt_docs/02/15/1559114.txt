WHICH of the popular tax-preparation software programs is best? There is no definitive answer. To examine the programs' pros and cons, I prepared a hypothetical federal return using the simplest version of each of three popular programs for do-it-yourselfers -- TurboTax, TaxCut and CCH CompleteTax.
TurboTax generally costs a bit more than the other programs, but not by enough to make that the determining factor for most people. A user may want to try all three programs, in consecutive years, or just TurboTax and TaxCut if working online -- the only way CompleteTax can be used -- is not appealing, then decide which one is most comfortable and stick with it.
The return was for a married couple, Mr. and Ms. Fyler, who are both salaried employees and have no children. The Fylers earned several hundred dollars in interest and stock dividends in 2003 and sold two stocks. Ms. Fyler, who has no pension plan at her job, contributed to an Individual Retirement Account. She also earned a consulting fee, for which she incurred no expenses. The Fylers itemize their deductions, which are for mortgage interest, real estate tax, state income tax, charitable contributions, union dues, professional publications and tax software.
Both TurboTax, from Intuit, and TaxCut, from H&amp;R Block, were ordered online and downloaded to a personal computer, although both also offer Web-based versions. CompleteTax, from CCH, can be used only online. The interview method was used for each return, and all the necessary records and documents -- W-2 forms, bank and brokerage-firm statements, canceled checks and the like -- were gathered before preparing the return. All the information was entered manually, and no data were imported from personal finance or bookkeeping programs, financial institutions or other sources. In each case, the program was asked to print the return for mailing, rather than to file it electronically.
All three programs arrived at the same bottom line with the same sample return.
TurboTax From Intuit
The tested version was TurboTax Basic, which costs $29.95 plus sales tax. The big drawback here was the time spent ordering and downloading the program from www.turbotax.com. Using a high-speed cable modem, it took an hour and a quarter. The program stopped midway through downloading, but when restarted, it offered to resume where it had left off. It would probably be faster to order the program as a CD online, which was an option, or to buy it on CD at a store. In a later test, it took less than 10 minutes to load the CD-based program onto a computer and download online updates.
Once it was running, TurboTax completed the sample return in an hour, including printing. During the interview process, which was well organized, TurboTax appears to pose questions that cover almost any conceivable situation. ''Yes'' answers sometimes led to more questions.
The questions and instructions for the sample return were generally clear, with one exception. The program asked: Did Ms. Fyler ''make a traditional I.R.A. contribution for 2003?'' I answered no, on the assumption that this fictitious taxpayer, like many real ones, would make her 2003 contribution this year; taxpayers have until April 15, 2004, to do so.
But the program never asked later whether she wanted to do so. Even after going back and changing the answer to ''yes,'' I still did not get a screen showing how much she was allowed to put into her I.R.A. That information, however, was available by clicking on a question link on the right side of the screen.
TaxCut From H &amp; R Block
The tested version was TaxCut Standard; the downloadable version is $14.95 at www.hrblock.com. The ordering and downloading took 45 minutes, possibly because of some ineptness on my part. Faced with an option to open or save the program, I chose open. Later, during the installation process, there was an instruction to close all Windows programs. Assuming that this included Internet Explorer, the software used to order the program, I closed them all, and the program could not be found. But a second trip to the TaxCut Web site allowed the downloading process to be completed.
Again, the advice is to buy the CD. That also took less than 10 minutes to load and update online in a later test.
The program ran in much the same way as TurboTax, offering options for almost any imaginable situation, and prepared the sample return in an hour. I inadvertently bypassed the option to report interest earned, requiring some backpedaling after the interview was complete and I realized there was still a pile of unentered 1099 forms from several banks.
TaxCut was a little clearer than the other two programs about an I.R.A. for Ms. Fyler, asking if she had contributed to an I.R.A. for 2003 or planned ''to do so by April 15, 2004.'' But it, too, did not offer any automatic guidance on the maximum amount she could contribute. Pushing the ''help'' button, always visible on the screen, led to a general discussion of I.R.A.'s, and several paragraphs into that discussion was the explanation that the maximum contribution to a traditional I.R.A. was $3,000 or 100 percent of that year's wages, whichever was less.
The instructions for Ms. Fyler's consulting fee were a little misleading, resulting in an error, but the program caught it. The interview asked for income from a business, which was duly listed. Later, it asked for income reported on a 1099 form -- which businesses use to report payments to individuals who are not employees. Since the hypothetical return involved a 1099 for that income, the same amount was reported twice. But one of the warnings in the final review advised the Fylers to make sure that their income from Form 1099 was not counted twice.
The questions regarding miscellaneous deductions were not quite so detailed as those of the other two programs. There was no separate line, for instance, for union dues, a not-uncommon deduction among taxpayers who itemize. Instead, there was just a catch-all line for ''other job-related expenses.''
CCH CompleteTax
This program allows only online preparation, at www.completetax.com, which may make some filers nervous about potential loss of control over their tax data, despite the site's assurances of security.
Preparation of the return took just more than an hour, including printing. Over all, that made it faster than the other two, but much of the time invested in the other programs was spent downloading, which is not necessary with CompleteTax; nor would it be with the Web-based versions of TurboTax and TaxCut.
The interview format, like that in the other two programs, seems to have questions that cover almost any possible situation.
CompleteTax also fell down on the I.R.A. question, asking, ''Did you make payments to an I.R.A.?'' The question was answered ''no,'' and, as it did with TurboTax, that answer eliminated the opportunity to indicate later that such a payment would be made before the return was filed. It was easier to tab back in CompleteTax to the section where such deductions were listed than it was in TurboTax. But while there is a question-and-answer box related to the topic on the screen, it did not offer any advice on the maximum contribution Ms. Fyler could make. Even typing ''How much can I contribute to an I.R.A.?'' in the interactive dialog box did not produce an answer.
CompleteTax does not require payment until the return is complete, but the user cannot see the results, print the return or file it electronically until payment is made. The cost, $29.95, includes a state return (which was not completed, so that the preparation time of each program could be compared directly). Companion state programs for the downloaded software cost extra -- $24.95 for TaxCut and $29.95 for TurboTax, although TurboTax offers a free state download with its more expensive versions.
