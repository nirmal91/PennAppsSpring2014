To the Editor:
People who have criticized Bill T. Jones for political correctness should take note of the fact that he was able to see behind the ''shocking title'' of Flannery O'Connor's story ''The Artificial Nigger'' [''The Sincerest Form of Flannery,'' Feb. 1] and not only appreciate but build on the greatness of the story itself.
