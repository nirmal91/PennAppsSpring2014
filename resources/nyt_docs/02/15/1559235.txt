To the Editor:
Richard Holbrooke and Richard Furman (Op-Ed, Feb. 10) place an emphasis on confidential H.I.V. testing, which they say will lead to better public health in countries gravely affected. Sharper focus needs to be placed on increasing availability of pharmacological interventions that have helped dramatically stem mortality from AIDS in the West.
To tackle this problem head on, governments need to locally manufacture the drugs, now available, but far too expensive for third world incomes. Then initiatives like Uganda's A.B.C. (Abstinence, Be Faithful and Condoms) will be more realistic.
Here in the United States, testing avoidance also exists. But it is much easier for health professionals to counsel against irrational fear because there is now effective treatment available.
Unfortunately, one cannot say that to our brothers and sisters in Africa and Asia.
