Last-minute donations and a supply of aid from the state helped save the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport, which was threatened with closing because of a 20 percent budget shortfall.
Gov. John G. Rowland added $250,000 in state grants to the 2004-5 state budget, which is enough to cover the museum's deficit.
''It's ironic that the state had decided to add science to its Mastery Test program, so now more than ever museums such as ours are essential,'' said Jeffrey Clair, chairman of the museum's board of trustees, said last week
''If we are not here, it really puts New Haven and Fairfield counties at a major disadvantage.''
