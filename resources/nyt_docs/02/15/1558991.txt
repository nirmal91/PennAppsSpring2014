To the Editor:
As to how scientific inquiry into artistic mysteries threatens to ''demystify'' art ['' 'The Scream,' East of Krakatoa'' by Richard Panek, Feb. 8], I say, ''Nonsense!'' The article correctly illustrates some of the mysteries that remain even after science discovers the literal truth of a work of art but fails to point out that such discoveries only restate in scientific terms a mystery the artist already recognized.
In ''The Scream,'' the mystery is not just why Edvard Munch had such a reaction to a blood-red sunset while no one else did but why and how such a color can so powerfully affect someone's emotions at all. These are the mysteries that artists have been exploring since they started painting on cave walls. These are the mysteries in which art and science coincide.
