Re ''Freed Afghan, 15, Recalls a Year at Guant√°namo'' (news article, Feb. 11):
With the repatriation of the Afghan teenager who was mistakenly caught up in the ''fog of war,'' those advocating the importance of literacy and the knowledge of languages in combating poverty will now have a laboratory example to observe over time.
The youth acknowledges that he ''got something good from them,'' referring to the American troops. ''I can read and write.'' He also learned English. It will be interesting to see if he can take advantage of the opportunities he has been given.
