This is nearly the 175th consecutive Philadelphia winter broken up by the color and warmth of the Philadelphia Flower Show. Since the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's first flower show in 1829, the event has grown, with one or two interruptions, into a major Philadelphia institution that last year attracted 250,000 visitors, according to its organizers. The show carries a distinctive Main Line society cachet while it packs the aisles with casual weekend gardeners and other enthusiasts who, in winter's third month, simply need to spend a day inhaling the scents of bloom and loam.
For March's show, the Horticultural Society will play host to more than 140 vendors selling flowers and garden supplies and thousands of competitive entries over 10 acres at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. This year's theme is ''Destination Paradise,'' introduced by professional displays florally depicting some decidedly non-Philadelphia neighborhoods, including the great angelic hereafter, an undersea utopia and a South Pacific island landscaped with 100,000 orchids.
Outside the Convention Center, the city's entertainments beckon you to defy the elements. It has world-class museums, foodie-magnet restaurants, enough theaters and music stages to occupy every evening of your visit and hotels with mostly everything within walking distance. Every visitor should take at least one leisurely stroll along Walnut Street and through European-styled Rittenhouse Square. But remember, this is Philadelphia, a car-choked, red-light-running American metropolis: watch out for motorists careering through the crosswalks.
Events
The Philadelphia Flower Show runs March 7 to 14 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets; (215) 988-8899, or see www.theflowershow.com. In 1829, when the show was held in a single room at the Masonic Hall, a winter-flowering marvel called the poinsettia was introduced. This year's attractions include lectures, gardening demonstrations and, in the Wedding Room, a series of floral exhibitions depicting every stage of one's nuptials, from engagement to honeymoon. Advance tickets are $20, available online. Tickets are $26 March 7, $24 March 13 and 14 and $22 other days.
After the show's hothouse pleasures, the visitor may be ready for the bracing ocean air and sea spray as displayed within the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Through May 31, ''Manet and the Sea'' is dedicated to the marine paintings of Edouard Manet and others. His lush, lyrical compositions, which he began painting in the 1860's, confounded contemporary expectations of ocean landscapes and inspired his younger Impressionist colleagues. About 100 objects, including paintings, watercolors and a sketchbook, are displayed. Tickets, $20, should be purchased well in advance ($3 service fee), at (215) 235-7469 or at www.philamuseum.org. The museum, on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street not far from downtown (accessible on foot and by cab or bus), offers attractive hotel packages and travel discounts. Closed Monday.
In recent years Broad Street south of City Hall has stylized itself as the Avenue of the Arts, making its cynosure the new Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, which opened in December 2001. Nearly every night at least one of the Kimmel's two performance halls is animated by classical music, dance, pop or jazz, produced by its eight resident companies and visiting groups. This spring the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of its new conductor, Christoph Eschenbach, begins a cycle of Mahler's symphonic works continuing through 2008. Two contemporary Irish groups appear during flower show week: Solas on March 13 at 7:30 pm., tickets $28 and $38; and the Chieftans on March 14 at 2 p.m., tickets $33 to $73. And every Wednesday at 6 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday at noon, you can wander into the Kimmel's broad Commonwealth Plaza and attend a free performance by promising local and regional musicians. The Kimmel is on Broad between Spruce and Delancey Streets; (215) 893-1999; www.kimmelcenter.org.
This spring, the Phillies will open their 43,500-seat stadium, Citizens Bank Park. Opening Day is April 12, at 1:05 p.m. against the Cincinnati Reds. The field is at Pattison and 11th, a quick drive from downtown or a short walk from the Broad Street Subway. Tickets: (215) 463-1000, www.phillies.com or at the park.
Sightseeing
The landscaping and renewal of Independence Mall, the park in front of Independence Hall between Fifth and Sixth and Chestnut and Arch Streets, is not yet complete, but several new historical attractions are open. The Independence Visitors Center is at Sixth and Market.
The Liberty Bell recently moved into its own museum, the Liberty Bell Center, on the corner of the mall at Sixth and Chestnut. Broadsides on display testify to the bell's symbolic importance to the abolitionist movement in the 19th century, and film clips demonstrate how it became a national icon. The bell stands by itself in an alcove whose window dramatically frames its original home, Independence Hall. The entrance to the Liberty Bell Center is through the old pavilion on Market Street, now used for security screening. Admission is free; open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., www.nps.gov/inde/liberty-bell.html. For information about Independence Mall, call (215) 597-8974.
The best addition to the mall is the National Constitution Center, on Arch Street. A spacious, spirited museum refreshingly free of Philadelphia red brick, the center celebrates the history of the Constitution. Original documents, film clips and interactive gadgets dramatize the still lively issues surrounding the document. Admission is $6. Open daily except Christmas and Thanksgiving. Information: (866) 917-1787 or www.constitutioncenter.org.
In the newly expanded Rosenbach Museum and Library, at 2008-10 Delancey Place, (215) 732-1600, www.rosenbach.org, a new wing has been named the Maurice Sendak Building, recognizing the long association that the author and illustrator has had with the museum. March 2 to Aug. 15, the Sendak Gallery will present ''Alligators All Around: An Alphabet,'' displaying his original sketches and watercolors for the beloved children's book. The most celebrated object in the museum's rare-book collection is the manuscript of James Joyce's ''Ulysses,'' the crucial evidence in the continuing debate over which published edition is most faithful to Joyce's intentions. Closed Monday. Admission is $8, with a tour.
If the weather's nice, one of the loveliest places to spend an afternoon in Philadelphia is on the path that runs along the Schuylkill and Kelly Drive, near the Art Museum. The much-used path runs through a stand of woods, up behind the Art Museum, past the boathouses maintained by local rowing clubs, on the way to Manayunk and beyond. A magnificent view of the river stretches from the terrace of the Fairmount Waterworks, the 1815 water pumping station.
Where to Stay
The 33-story Philadelphia Savings Fund Society building in 1932 became the first International Style skyscraper built in the United States. It was restored and reopened in 2000 as a hotel, the Loews Philadelphia, 1200 Market Street; (215) 627-1200; fax (215) 231-7310, or see the Web site www.loewshotels.com/hotels/philadelphia.

The hotel's 98 guest rooms, which share the building with apartment condominiums, have a stately residential ambience, enhanced by its current floor-by-floor makeover. On a recent drop-in visit, the work seemed unobtrusive. Doubles from $230 to $380.
Where to Eat
One of the most acclaimed restaurants in the city, Lacroix at the Rittenhouse, (215) 790-2533, is in the Rittenhouse Hotel, overlooking the square. The chef, Jean-Marie Lacroix, has composed a menu of adventurous French cuisine that, like the restaurant's interior, is modern and unstuffy. Dinners include roasted wild boar loin, skate and rabbit, offered in three prix-fixe meals at $58, $67 and $75. The veal breast with braised leeks and a salad with shallot vinaigrette is highly recommended. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
A large, round bar dominates El Vez, 121 South 13th Street, (215) 928-9800, the glittery, jumping new Mexican restaurant at the corner of Sansom Street. Slowly revolving above the bar is a glass, chrome and neon-lighted lowrider bicycle, a distinctive Mexican-American art form. Servers wheel avocado-laden lowrider carts to your table, where they prepare fresh guacamole to order. The slow-roasted spiced lamb, wrapped in banana leaves and served with frijoles charros and corn tortillas, is a good bet. A meal for two with a couple of margaritas, runs about $100. Dinner nightly, lunch weekdays.
Fork is a renowned American bistro in an old dry goods store in Old City, at 306 Market Street; (215) 625-9425. At lunchtime I enjoyed a spicy, warming Thai vegetable coconut curry. Dinner nightly, lunch weekdays and brunch on Sunday. A dinner for two with wine is about $100.
Warmdaddy's, Front and Market Streets, (215) 627-2500, offers what it calls ''culture of a Southern kind'' -- beef ribs, honey-dipped fried chicken and cornmeal-crusted catfish, served with collard greens and, nearly every night, live jazz and blues. There's a $5 or $10 music charge. Dinner and drinks for two: about $70.
Kibitz in the City, 703 Chestnut Street, (215) 928-1447, the bustling, cafeteria-style Jewish delicatessen near Independence Hall, has pastrami sandwiches as juicy and spiced as the ones your grandmother sent out for. It's $10.50 for an overstuffed sandwich that two can share. Open to 7:30 p.m.; closed Sunday.
