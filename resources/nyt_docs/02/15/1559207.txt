The big news in National Basketball Association coaching circles has been up around Exit 16 on the Turnpike, near the Meadowlands, with Lawrence Frank winning his first nine games at the helm of the Nets.
But they are cheering at Exit 36 of the Garden State Parkway, too. That's the one near the Margate home of Chris Ford, who last week was named interim coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. Mr. Ford, an Atlantic City native, replaced Randy Ayers, who had a woeful 21-31 record as coach of the 76ers.
Unlike Mr. Frank, who never even played high school basketball, Mr. Ford was a star at every level. He played at Holy Spirit High School in Absecon and at Villanova University before a 10-year professional career on the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics.
Again unlike Mr. Frank, this is not Mr. Ford's first N.B.A. coaching job. He has had stints with the Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Clippers.
But like Mr. Frank, Mr. Ford is also undefeated this year, albeit for only one game. On Wednesday, the 76ers, reversing a string of bad performances, beat the Washington Wizards 113-88 in Mr. Ford's first game as coach.
