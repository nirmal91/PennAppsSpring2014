MOST Americans will get bigger refunds this filing season than they have in past years, thanks to the tax cuts enacted in May, but to take full advantage of the breaks that the law allows will require some time and attention. The law trimmed rates on ordinary income, and that is easy enough to understand. It also reduced those for long-term capital gains and most stock dividends, but investors will have to pay close attention to detail to categorize all the information properly.
One way to understand both how the law works and how to save on taxes is to walk step by step through a sample Form 1040, even if you have a professional prepare your return -- or returns. The family in this hypothetical return saved $1,609 and avoided the alternative minimum tax by giving appreciated securities to their son -- who sold them to pay college costs and filed his own return, but owed no taxes -- rather than selling the securities directly to pay his college expenses.
The return was prepared by Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times in consultation with Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst at CCH Inc., a provider of tax and business law information and software; and Ernest Zoumot, director of product management for CCH, using the company's online consumer program, CompleteTax, which is available at www.completetax.com.
Some tax-savings strategies that are popular among middle-income Americans do not show up directly on the return but are discussed in the accompanying commentary. Among them are shifting some pay into tax-free employee-benefit plans, when available, instead of taking it all as taxable salary, and contributing to tax-deferred retirement plans.
