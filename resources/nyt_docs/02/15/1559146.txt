To the Editor:
''In the Name of Norton'' (F.Y.I., Feb. 8) points out that Art Carney has not been honored for his role as Ed Norton in ''The Honeymooners'' but that a bus depot has been named for Jackie Gleason for his role as Ralph Kramden.
Not only that, but a statue of Jackie Gleason dressed as Ralph Kramden in his bus driver's uniform stands beside the Port Authority Bus Terminal on the northwest corner of 40th Street and Eighth Avenue. It's an inconguous site for the statue, since the drivers who use the terminal are not city bus drivers, as Ralph Kramden was.
