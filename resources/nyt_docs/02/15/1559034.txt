More than ever, babies are staking their own wee claim on the luxury goods market, as parents eagerly swaddle their children in clothes, accessories and other assorted products with designer pedigrees. From cashmere cardigans to velvet and silver bracelets, babies can now romp around in the same labels as their parents do, reminding everyone that they are, after all, the ultimate luxury.
A see-through plastic bag by Jimmy Choo has been co-opted by the diaper-toting set. The bag, called the Hobo, comes with a leather zip pouch, which attaches inside and is handy for sundries like diaper balm. The Hobo is $880 at Jimmy Choo stores.
