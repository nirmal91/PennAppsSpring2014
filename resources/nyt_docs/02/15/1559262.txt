RISING
MICHIGAN STATE -- The Spartans (13-9, 8-3 Big Ten) had 15 steals and limited Minnesota to 19 points in the second half yesterday to win, 69-58. They have won 8 of their last 10; a late surge could take the sting out of an 0-7 record against ranked opponents and earn them a bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament.
MEMPHIS -- The Tigers (18-4, 9-2) took the lead in Conference USA, winning by 89-71 at Marquette last night for their eighth straight victory. They made 16 of 31 3-pointers. Sean Banks, a freshman, made 6 of 7 3-pointers and scored 28 points.
L.S.U. -- The Tigers are making their move to clinch a bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament. They won, 73-70, at No. 22 Florida yesterday, closing the game on a 15-4 run. ''I think we'll get a lot more recognition now that we have this win,'' Darrel Mitchell (18 points) said.
CHARLOTTE -- The 49ers (15-6, 7-3 Conference USA) are 7-3 in their last 10 after yesterday's 46-45 loss at St. Louis. That should not negate victories over Syracuse, Southern Illinois and Cincinnati, all on the road. And, with guard Demon Brown suspended, they defeated Louisville last Thursday. That should be enough for an at-large bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament.
FALLING
MISSOURI -- They were expected to contend for the conference championship, but off-the-court problems have haunted the Tigers (10-10, 5-5 Big 12). They are struggling on the court, too, with a loss at home to Belmont. At one point, they fell below .500 for the first time in five seasons.
INDIANA -- The Hoosiers (12-10, 6-5) lost at Purdue yesterday, 71-56, and have been overpowered inside during their 1-4 slump. Iowa outscored the Hoosiers, 42-22, in the paint, Illinois outscored them by 30-12, and Michigan State's Paul Davis outscored them by 32-7. Yesterday, Ije Nwankwo scored a career-high 17 and got Indiana's post players into foul trouble early.
CORNELL -- The Big Red (10-11, 5-3) was 5-0 in the Ivy but lost its third in a row last night, 79-52 at home to Penn. Guard Ka'Ron Barnes had his usual strong game (22 points), but guard Cody Toppert (17.2) was limited to 7.
SYRACUSE -- The Orangemen (16-5, 6-4 Big East) overpowered Miami yesterday but are 6-4 in their last 10. That includes a 21-point loss to Pitt and a 28-point loss to UConn. Point guard Billy Edelin (13.8 points) has not played in four of the last five games and is out indefinitely because of ''personal issues'' unrelated to basketball, Coach Jim Boeheim said.
