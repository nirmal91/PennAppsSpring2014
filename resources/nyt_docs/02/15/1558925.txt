Valentine's Day comes and goes, but most of the natural world could not care less. At national wildlife refuges across the country, the amorous send their greetings through groans, roars and other signals at various times of the year. Elsewhere, mothers carefully lay their eggs, and herds are culled. For travelers who want to view animal rituals, binoculars are a good accessory.
MARCH-APRIL -- Snow geese migration, Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, north of Aberdeen, S.D.; (605) 885-6320. From a few hundred thousand to a million snow geese pause on their return to northern breeding grounds. They typically stay for a few days to three weeks; the refuge staff strongly suggests calling ahead to verify dates.
JUNE-JULY -- Loggerhead turtle nesting, Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, Melbourne Beach, Fla.; (772) 562-3909. Guided evening tours only. Visitors are taken up close to watch as females lay eggs. No flash photography or flashlights allowed, and bug repellent and long sleeves are strongly recommended.
APRIL-MAY -- Alligator mating, Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, south of Waycross, Ga.; (912) 496-7836. Males among the 10,000 to 12,000 gators bask on the banks of waterways, and when the urge hits, they slip into the water and emit a low guttural sound similar to a roar. Viewing from an observation tower and on guided boat tours.
JULY-AUGUST -- Bison rut, National Bison Range, 40 miles north of Missoula, Mont.; (406) 644-2211. Males among the population of about 400 bison chase off rivals for mates, through growling and other noises, threatening actions and the occasional fight. Ringside viewing along a 19-mile road. (Male elks go courting with bugling sounds in mid to late September to early October.)
JULY 28 AND 29 -- Wild pony roundup, Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, Chincoteague, Va.; (757) 336-6122. To keep the pony population on Assateague Island at about 150, the herd is led across a channel on the last Wednesday in July to Chincoteague, where foals are auctioned off the next day. Best viewing of the swim over is on Chincoteague.
