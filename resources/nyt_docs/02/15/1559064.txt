New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park was also a spectacle outside the tents. The scene included, bottom row, from left: David Barton demonstrating in-flight exercises; PETA members protesting the furred fashion flock; 10 bull terriers for Target; a one-painting show; police in full regalia; and a coachman for O'Halloran riding gear. Stylish women, top row, wiggled into the designer shows. Seen in profusion: valentine motifs and high-button boots.
