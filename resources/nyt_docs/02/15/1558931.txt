Two recent immigrants, Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a Nigerian man, and Senay (Audrey Tautou), a young woman from Turkey, work at the same London hotel. Okwe rents the sofa in Senay's flat.
OKWE -- (He shows her a postcard.) Oh, Senay -- this came for you.  SENAY -- Why did you not tell me?!  OKWE -- I just told you.  Later, they are eating dinner together in the apartment.
OKWE -- You have friends in New York? The postcard.  SENAY -- I have a cousin. Ever since I was small she has written to me.  OKWE -- I sometimes wish London were more like New York. It would be easy to drive a cab there.  SENAY -- You have been to New York? And you came back?  OKWE -- I lived there for a time.  SENAY -- In the winter they put lights in the trees. Is that true?  And you can skate in the parks. And some of the policemen ride white horses -- not all of them but some. What did you do there?  OKWE -- I worked in a hospital.  SENAY -- You were a cleaner?  OKWE -- I was there to study.  SENAY -- So why are you working in a hotel?  OKWE -- It is an African story.  SENAY -- I've noticed that you never answer yes or no, you are very strange.  OKWE -- Do you drink wine Senay?  SENAY -- Don't you want to know why I left Turkey?  OKWE -- Because you want to live like your cousin.  SENAY -- No. Because I do not want to live like my mother. Yes.  OKWE -- Yes what?  SENAY -- Yes I do drink wine.  OKWE -- This is a recipe from Nigeria. In Nigeria they do many interesting things with pork ----  Senay stops chewing -- she spits her mouthful out in horror.  OKWE -- ---- but of course I used lamb.
