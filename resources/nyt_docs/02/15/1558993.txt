To the Editor:
While Neil Strauss's assessment of Courtney Love's attempt at a comeback [''Pop's Best Behaved . . . and Its Worst,'' Feb. 8] offers valid points, his comparison of Ms. Love with Eminem is completely misguided. Eminem does not court controversy the way Ms. Love does; his place in the tabloids depends not on current antics, but on his history and the literal interpretation of his lyrics.
Eminem's relationship with his mother and his rumored affair with Mariah Carey are no more controversial than the personal lives of other rappers; some of them have actually served time. Compared with Ms. Love, Eminem is hardly controversial at all.
