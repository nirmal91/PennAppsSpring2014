Fred Jones was the surprise winner of the N.B.A.'s slam-dunk contest Saturday. Jones, a guard for the Pacers, defeated Golden State guard Jason Richardson, who was trying to become the event's first three-time winner.
Jones's most impressive dunk was one in which he caught his own bounce pass before slamming in a windmill jam. Even in defeat, Richardson may have had the best jam, tossing the ball off the backboard, catching it, putting it between his legs and dunking.
In the other events, Denver's Voshon Lenard unseated the two-time defending champion, Peja Stojakovic, in the 3-point shootout, and New Orleans's Baron Davis captured the skills challenge for point guards.
