To the Editor:
Regarding: ''For Group Doctors, a Winning Model'' (Feb. 1):
The article fails to emphasize the primary reason for the success we've experienced at the Mount Kisco Medical Group: top-draw, unparalleled, all-important patient care. Yes, we are fortunate to have a savvy executive, financial and operations team.
We are fortunate to have an efficient, well-run, safe and convenient ambulatory surgery center. We are fortunate to have both primary care providers and specialists conveniently situated under one roof.
It should come as no surprise however, that these measures were instituted with our patients needs foremost.
We recruited a top-draw business team so that physicians can concentrate all efforts on patient care and leave cumbersome paperwork, insurance and billing issues to those experienced and interested in such.
We (surgeons) operate at the outpatient ambulatory surgery center because it runs efficiently, administers exemplary care and allows us to avoid horrendous delays in returning to see patients in the office.
We refer to the specialist downstairs because we went to great lengths to insure that he/she is the most qualified, compassionate, hard-working and expertly trained physician.
