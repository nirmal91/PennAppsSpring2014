A Bronx teenager was killed yesterday morning at a party in his apartment building by what appeared to be an accidental gunshot to the head, the police said.
The teenager, Nathaniel Vallejo, 17, known to his friends as Nate, had just returned to New York after seven months in the Dominican Republic, his mother said.
''I decided to take him away from the trouble and the drugs and everything around here,'' said his mother, Riquelma Betances, 35, a city bus driver in the Bronx.
She said: ''He was a good boy. He respected me. He never raised his voice and always asked for permission to do anything.''
Mr. Vallejo would have turned 18 next Saturday. He was killed at 3055 Bouck Avenue in Baychester, in the apartment of a friend where young people in the building would often hang out, residents said.
The teenager was shot at 1:13 a.m., the police said, but it was unclear whether he or someone else had been holding the gun. After the shooting, everyone in the apartment ran away, locking the door behind them, Mr. Vallejo's friends said.
A friend of Ms. Betances, Xiomara Martinez, 35, said she had also sent her son away from New York shortly after Mr. Vallejo left.
''You realize, your son is not a bad kid, but he could get on the wrong track, and you have to do something,'' she said. ''We discussed it and discussed it, and we decided to send our sons to the Dominican Republic. It's a way to save them.''
Several friends put together a memorial to Mr. Vallejo in the building's lobby, and Ms. Betances' friends came over to console her.
''It could be me sitting over there crying,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''My son, he's not coming back after this.''
