To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. May Support Israeli Approach on Leaving Gaza'' (front page, Feb. 13):
Rather than simply accepting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's unilateral approach, America should use its considerable ability to influence Israel in order to leverage Palestinian actions that are consistent with the road map.
Unless President Bush is able to parlay Israel's unilateral intentions into an interim bilateral Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Mr. Sharon's historic gesture could have the unintended effect of strengthening terror groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad. They will be perceived as the victors who forced Israel to act without any Palestinian concessions.
This victory for extremists could further fan the flames of conflict between Arabs and Israelis, and our country's efforts in Iraq and elsewhere in that volatile region would be dangerously undermined.
