To the Editor:
Re ''A First Lady Fiercely Loyal and Quietly Effective'' (front page, Feb. 7):
It is sad but not surprising to learn that although our president does read newspapers -- five of them, daily -- he does not read the opinions of those who disagree with him.
He could certainly be excused from reading the opinions of those who agree with him, since presumably he understands his own positions. But he really should have some interest in other points of view. Monumental mistakes get made when only one side is heard.
