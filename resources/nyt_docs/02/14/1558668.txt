The New York City Ballet made choreographic sunshine with ''Coppélia'' on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater.
First produced in Paris in 1870 and later restaged in Russia, the ballet, with a delicious score by Léo Delibes, remains a comic masterpiece. The plot is simple. Swanilda loves Frantz, but Frantz is torn between her and Coppélia, the supposed daughter of Dr. Coppélius, an inventor. When Swanilda discovers that Coppélia is only a doll, she restores Frantz to his senses. ''Coppélia'' celebrates cleverness and cautions against infatuation.
This production based on Russian sources is by George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova, a celebrated Swanilda. It's great fun and should prevent balletgoers from assuming that Balanchine, the master of abstract ballet, was uninterested in stories. When a story caught his fancy he staged it lovingly.
''Coppélia'' received a loving interpretation, with Jenifer Ringer as a delightful Swanilda. Her miming was lucid in outline, and dramatically and comically meaningful. Her dancing was clear and unaffected.
By letting her steps sparkle in her allegros, she revealed Swanilda's brightness. And her lyrical phrases were convincing evidence that Swanilda truly loves Frantz. Tricking Frantz and Coppélius by pretending to be the doll, Ms. Ringer progressed in fine comic style from mechanical stiffness to emotional warmth and then erupted with mischief.
Damian Woetzel's Frantz was a likable rogue. His dancing was always big and bold, his energy suggesting the character's impetuosity.
Robert La Fosse, a former member of the company now appearing as a guest artist, offered a subtle Coppélius. At first he seemed only a harmless fussbudget, but as he tried to bring his doll magically to life he grew ever more eerily demented.
In the concluding allegorical wedding festivities, Jennifer Tinsley swept lightly though the choreography in her debut as Dawn; Dana Hanson glided calmly as Prayer.
Richard Moredock conducted.
