Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the issue of gay marriage referred imprecisely to reports of a discussion on an airplane trip between President Bush and Representative Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina. (The error was repeated in a front-page cross-reference on Monday about an interview the president gave to ''Meet the Press'' on NBC about issues in the presidential campaign.) While Mr. DeMint did say that he and Mr. Bush talked about having contracts and agreements in relationships, the congressman said that Mr. Bush did not refer specifically to gay partnerships; Mr. DeMint said the discussion centered on marriage in general.
The headline reference to ''options on gay rights'' also overstated Mr. DeMint's description of Mr. Bush's position. The congressman said Mr. Bush was open to various types of agreements in relationships; he did not say the president was open to states' bolstering gay rights.
