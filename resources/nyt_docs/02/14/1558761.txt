To the Editor:
Re ''Conservatives Shine Spotlight on Kerry's Antiwar Record'' (news article, Feb. 13):
Supporters of President Bush are impugning John Kerry's patriotism because he led protests against the Vietnam War. This ignores the fact that he had fought gallantly in that war, earning the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts.
It also ignores the fact that the great majority of Americans came to the realization that we were grievously mistaken to have fought that war.
On the other hand, President Bush, who supported the war, was never near a battlefield.
If I were a Republican, I would not ''go there.''
