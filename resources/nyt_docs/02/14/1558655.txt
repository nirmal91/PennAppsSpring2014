To the Editor:
Re ''Nat Turner in History's Multiple Mirrors'' (Arts &amp; Ideas, Feb. 7): The massacre of 55 people, ''mostly women and children,'' is inexcusable under any circumstances, even a revolt against slavery.
Speaking of the slave Nat Turner, who led the rebellion, you write that ''some white descendants of those killed maintain his actions were immoral and indefensible.''
One need not be a relative of the victims to feel that way.
