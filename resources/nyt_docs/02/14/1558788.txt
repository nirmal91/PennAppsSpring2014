Border patrol agents searching a grain ship anchored near Portland found five stowaways from China. The authorities charged two crew members with human trafficking, a spokesman for the Coast Guard said. Officials said the captain of the 620-foot Liberian-flag vessel, the Pacific Dolphin, had called the Coast Guard to say he might have stowaways aboard. The stowaways, all men, boarded on Jan. 13 in Dailan, China, officials said.
