The European Commission set a new deadline yesterday of May 11 to announce its decision on the Oracle Corporation's hostile takeover of PeopleSoft . Originally, the regulators were supposed to complete their review by March 30. The commission, which is investigating the case for its impact on competition in the European software market, suspended its review in January when Oracle missed a crucial deadline for submitting requested documents. The United States Justice Department told PeopleSoft last week that it would announce by March 2 its decision on whether it will approve the deal.
