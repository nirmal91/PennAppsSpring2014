To the Editor:
I offer the following memo to Thomas L. Friedman (''Arabs, It's Your Move,'' column, Feb. 12) from the Arab League:
In February 2002, you asked us to reach out to Israel with a public offer for peace and normalization in exchange for a withdrawal to 1967 borders. In March 2002, the Arab League made that offer. Regrettably, this offer was dismissed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and virtually ignored by the United States.
Isn't it clear by now that Mr. Sharon wants Palestinian land more than he wants peace? No amount of gestures from us will change that. Only tough action by the United States (like withholding billions in American aid and supporting United Nations sanctions) will convince Israelis that Mr. Sharon and the settlements must go.
Until then, this conflict will continue to fester and the world will remain a dangerous place, both for you and for us.
