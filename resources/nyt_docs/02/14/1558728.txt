The St. John's freshman Tyler Jones has been reinstated after a two-game suspension and will be eligible to play Wednesday when the Red Storm meets Georgetown at Madison Square Garden.
He was among the six players who went to a strip club outside Pittsburgh after a game last Wednesday night. A woman they met at the club accused some of them of rape. She was later charged with false reports to law enforcement officials, prostitution and criminal theft by extortion, all misdemeanors.
Lamont Hamilton and Mohamed Diakite remain suspended, pending a decision by the university.
St. John's has barred center Abe Keita from the team, and he was suspended from the university for a year.
In addition to Keita, disciplinary action has been completed for Elijah Ingram, who withdrew from the university, and Grady Reynolds, who was expelled.
