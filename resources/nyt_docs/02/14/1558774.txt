The government reintroduced a bill in the House of Commons to decriminalize use of small amounts of marijuana. Under the measure, anyone possessing under 15 grams -- about enough for 20 cigarettes -- would be fined rather than face criminal charges, much like receiving a traffic ticket. At the same time, the bill sets stricter penalties for marijuana producers. An earlier version died when Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien retired in December and the Parliament session ended. The new law could pass as early as spring.
