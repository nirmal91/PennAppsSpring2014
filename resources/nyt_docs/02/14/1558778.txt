The Rangers will be without their best player, Jaromir Jagr, for this afternoon's rematch with the Flyers in Philadelphia.
Jagr, an All-Star right wing, aggravated a groin injury during the Rangers' 2-1 loss to the Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.
Jagr did not practice yesterday, nor did he accompany the Rangers to Philadelphia.
Jagr is also doubtful for Monday's afternoon game at the Garden against the Ottawa Senators.
Since the Rangers obtained him from the Washington Capitals on Jan. 23, Jagr has four goals and six assists in nine games. But the Rangers are 3-6-0-0 since the trade. Over their past 14 games, the Rangers are 3-9-2-0.
The Flyers have defeated the Rangers in all three meetings this season, all at the Garden.
Philadelphia, meanwhile, will be without center Jeremy Roenick, and, in all likelihood, center Keith Primeau.
Roenick's jaw was shattered early in the third period Thursday night when he was hit by a slap shot from Rangers defenseman Boris Mironov.
Just 32 seconds later, Primeau sustained a concussion after an open-ice collision with Bobby Holik.
Afterward, Holik insisted that the hit was accidental.
But Todd Fedoruk, one of the Flyers' enforcers, told The Philadelphia Inquirer yesterday that Holik would be a marked man today.
''At the end of the game, he was skating by, and I said he's dead tomorrow night,'' Fedoruk said at the Flyers' practice rink in Voorhees, N.J., yesterday. ''It's in the back of his mind.''
Roenick had surgery yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital.
''He will miss significant time,'' Coach Ken Hitchcock told reporters after yesterday's practice. ''I don't think anyone knows the exact time. It'll certainly be a lot longer than two to three weeks. We'll see how he feels in the next week or so.
''His jaw was broken pretty significantly, and his laceration is pretty significant.''
