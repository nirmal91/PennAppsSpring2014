Fire officials are investigating as suspicious a dormitory fire last night that forced 280 freshman students at the State University of New York at Purchase out of their rooms.
The fire began about 7 p.m. in a student lounge in the dormitory, according to Purchase Fire Chief Joseph Brefere. Firefighters put out the flames in 20 minutes and led students trapped on the upper floors of the three-story building to safety, he said.
''There was extensive smoke pouring into the hallways,'' the chief said. ''We had people trapped on the upper floors. The walls buckled from the heat.''
Three students suffered smoke inhalation; no other injuries were reported. The flames damaged two or three rooms adjoining the student lounge, and the smoke caused extensive damage to the rooms and hallways, the chief said.
The university authorities relocated 123 students to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains, said Geraldine Sanderson, a university spokeswoman. It was not clear how long the students would remain in the hotel.
Chief Brefere said fire marshals were examining the dormitory last night for accelerants. Smoking was banned in the lounge where the fire began. The room contained a television and couches, the chief said.
''Couches don't just burst into flames,'' he said.
No sprinkler system was installed in the students' rooms and the lounge, Chief Brefere said. Only the trash rooms were equipped with sprinklers, he said.
''Sprinklers would have made a world of difference,'' he said. ''A sprinkler would have knocked down this fire before we even got there.''
In 2000, a fire set in a dormitory at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., killed three students. The dormitory did not have sprinklers.
