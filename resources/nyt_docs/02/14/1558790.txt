The largest tax increases in state history became law automatically after Gov. Mike Huckabee refused to veto or sign them. The new law raises the sales tax, to 6 percent from 5.125 percent. Mr. Huckabee, a Republican, had promised to remain neutral on the higher taxes, which are dedicated to education, unless the General Assembly approved a larger reorganization of the schools.
