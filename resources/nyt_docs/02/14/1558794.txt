John Moffitt, a 23-year-old senior at Louisiana State, became the world leader in the long jump for this indoor season when he leaped 27 feet 1 3/4 inches last night in winning at the fourth annual New Balance Collegiate Invitational. The meet continues today at the Armory Track and Field Center in Upper Manhattan with collegiate, high school and open competition for men and women.
The world leader this season before Moffitt was Vitaly Fhkurlatov of Russia at 27- 1/2.
Moffitt, however, did not surpass the meet or Armory record of 28-2, set two years ago by Miguel Pate of Arkansas.
Other winners yesterday were Kierra Foster, a Maryland sophomore, in the women's long jump (20-5); Boys and Girls High School of Brooklyn, which had the fourth-fastest United States indoor girls' 4x800-meter relay, at 9 minutes 6.75 seconds; and Ashley Couper of Bermuda, who won the women's open 1,500 in 4:21.53. Alisa Harvey, 38, was second in 4:22.24.
