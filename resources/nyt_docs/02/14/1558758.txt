To the Editor:
Re ''Pond and a Puck Are Enough for Hockey Purists'' (front page, Feb. 12):
For 10 minutes, your article transported me back to a prewar frozen lake in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, where my pals and I learned the great sport of ice hockey.
Then, regrettably, back to reality.
Spin doctors take charge of an election.
Gay marriage, yes or no?
Whatever happened to the pond at Prospect Park?
