To the Editor:
I came of age playing hockey 40 years ago on makeshift outdoor rinks along frozen Lake Koshkonong in Edgerton, Wis., and I read the story of the tournaments in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick (front page, Feb. 12), with passionate envy. Thanks for bringing back memories of daylong tests of manhood, of lakeside bonfires, coolers of beer that needed no ice, and games and days ending happily with participants lying on the snow looking up at millions of brightly shining stars.
