Led by their team president, Isiah Thomas, the Knicks have made little secret of their desire to improve the roster for what they believe could be a playoff run. With that in mind, the Knicks are watching the Vin Baker story with interest.
The Boston Celtics placed Baker on waivers yesterday, one day after voiding his contract. Baker, a 6-foot-11 veteran of 11 N.B.A. seasons, was averaging 11.3 points and 5.7 rebounds in 37 games for the Celtics this season.
Against the Knicks, Baker had 20 points and 8 rebounds in one game and 16 points and 12 rebounds in another.
But Baker was suspended indefinitely on Jan. 23 for not complying with his alcohol treatment program. It was the second time this season Baker had been suspended.
The Knicks have not had any conversations with Baker or his agent, Aaron Goodwin, a team official said, and they will wait until the waiver process is completed at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
If a team claims Baker before that, it will become liable for the remaining $6 million he is owed this season, in addition to the $30.375 million due over the next two seasons.
Billy Hunter, the head of the players association, said Baker's contract was guaranteed and the union would file a grievance to fight the Celtics' move.
Also yesterday, the Knicks announced that they had signed DerMarr Johnson, a 6-foot-9 guard and forward, for the rest of the season. They signed him to a 10-day contract on Feb. 3.
Johnson, who is 23 and was the sixth overall pick in the 2000 draft, was released by the Atlanta Hawks after missing last season because of a serious neck injury sustained in a car accident in September 2002.
