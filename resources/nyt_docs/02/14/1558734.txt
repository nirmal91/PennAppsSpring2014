The Food and Drug Administration told Barr Laboratories, the marketer of a so-called morning-after pill, yesterday that it was delaying its decision on whether to allow the drug to be sold over the counter.
The company's president, Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, said the agency called about 2 p.m. and then faxed a letter saying it was extending its Feb. 20 deadline by 90 days.
The agency has asked the company, in Pomona, N.Y., for more information about the emergency contraceptive, also known as Plan B, especially among teenagers, the company said. Plan B, to be taken when when regular contraception fails or is skipped, is available by prescription. Opponents, including some members of Congress, have objected to the application to sell it over the counter, arguing that that would encourage promiscuity and risky sex among younger people.
And many religious groups, some against abortion, oppose expanded use of the pill because they believe it interferes with conception. Plan B usually acts by preventing ovulation, but it may also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting.
Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the agency not infrequently asked for more data and delayed decisions while reviewing data. ''We can extend the goal date, and that's just what happened here,'' Dr. Galson said.
The drug's advocates reacted with trepidation, recalling that, all along, the application was political, and emotional. They feared that the agency was responding to pressure from conservatives, who oppose making Plan B readily available.
''This delay is a politically transparent roadblock,'' Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.
