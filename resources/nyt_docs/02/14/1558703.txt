Three people were indicted yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges that they defrauded the New York branch of the Bank of China out of more than $25 million.
According to federal authorities, John Chou, 43, and his wife, Sherry Liu, 44, of Alpine, N.J., and a former bank manager, Patrick Young, 46, of Massapequa, N.Y., were scheduled to be arraigned late yesterday.
The indictment charges that from 1991 to 2002, Mr. Chou, Ms. Liu and Mr. Young schemed to get the Bank of China to pay the beneficiaries of letters of credit, which were companies that the couple owned, and to extend other financing for international trade transactions that never took place, according to a spokesman for the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.
Officials said that Mr. Chou and Ms. Liu bribed Mr. Young to participate in the scheme, and used their proceeds to extend loans to their businesses and to enrich themselves and their family.
