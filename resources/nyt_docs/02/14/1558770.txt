Citing ''numerous problems'' involving prescription drugs imported from Canada, the United States Food and Drug Administration has asked the Canadian government to take a more active role in inspecting mail-order and Internet pharmacies in Canada. A report by Minnesota's Board of Pharmacy said that it had found 32 violations of safe pharmacy practice during visits to eight Internet drugstores in Canada. A spokesman for the pharmacies, David MacKay, said the shortcomings had been ''blown out of proportion'' and that they were being rectified.
