To the Editor:
President Richard M. Nixon did not ''bludgeon'' Congress into giving him wage-price control powers (''The Nixon Recovery,'' by Charles R. Morris, Op-Ed, Feb. 7). Nixon repeatedly stated to the Democrats in Congress that he did not want that power. Congress insisted he take it so it could embarrass him about not using it to ''control'' the (then) outrageous inflation rate of just past 3 percent a year.
Nixon later did use it after getting pressured by John B. Connally (as Mr. Morris correctly notes) and Congress. I know about this because I was there as an observer, and because my late father, Herbert Stein, was a member of the Nixon Council of Economic Advisers at the time and was put in charge of administering Phase 1 of the wage-price freeze and controls (''like putting a nun in charge of a whorehouse,'' as he called it, since he had been so opposed to controls). This is all set out in detail in my father's book, ''Presidential Economics.''
