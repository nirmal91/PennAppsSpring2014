South Korea on Friday approved a plan to send 3,000 troops to Iraq, ending months of debate over the country's role there.
Public opinion in South Korea has been divided, prompting the government to limit the number of troops it will send. South Korea has already sent more than 400 medical and engineering troops to support American military operations in Iraq.
The 271-seat National Assembly approved the troop plan, with 155 in favor and 50 opposed. Another 59 lawmakers did not take part in the vote, while 7 abstained.
The first troops are expected to leave by the end of March, and the deployment would be completed by the end of April. The troops will be based in Kirkuk in northern Iraq.
It will be the largest overseas deployment of South Korean troops since the Vietnam War.
