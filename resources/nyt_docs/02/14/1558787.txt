James Ujaama, a former Seattle community activist, was sentenced in federal court to two years in prison for conspiring to aid the Taliban in Afghanistan. The authorities had originally charged Mr. Ujaama, 38, above in a 1991 photo, with trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in the spring in exchange for his helping in other terror inquiries.
