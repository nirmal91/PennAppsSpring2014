A man was hit in the head with a chain in a Brooklyn subway station last night, after two men taunted him with antigay remarks, the police said. The incident is being investigating as a possible bias crime, according to a Police Department spokeswoman.
The man, 33, was riding on a southbound G train at 7:40 p.m., when two unidentified men riding in the same subway car began making antigay statements.
The victim ran out of the subway car when it stopped at the Flushing Avenue station, but was confronted there by a third man, who had a chain, the police said.
The other two men followed him out of the subway car, and one of the three men then struck the victim on the head with the chain.
The men fled the scene, and the victim, who was not identified by the police, was taken to Brooklyn Hospital Center in stable condition.
