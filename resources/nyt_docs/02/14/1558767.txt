To the Editor:
Re ''Bush's Duty and Privilege,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 13):
Our all-voluntary military is made up primarily of middle-class and poor men and women. To a great extent, children of the affluent are getting out of sharing the burden of going into battle.
If America is going to use the military for pre-emptive strikes and nation-building, perhaps we should bring back the draft.
That would allow the privileged to do their fair share of duty and sacrifice. The rich and powerful should not be able to pull strings to get their children exempted.
