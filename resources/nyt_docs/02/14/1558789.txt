A state court has sided with the parents of a severely brain-damaged woman in part of a battle that pits them against the woman's husband, who wants her to be allowed to die. The Second District Court of Appeals ruled that a lower court should not have automatically denied the parents the right to intervene in a case on the constitutionality of a law passed in the fall to keep alive their daughter, Terri Schiavo. Mrs. Schiavo, 40, has depended on a feeding tube since 1990.
