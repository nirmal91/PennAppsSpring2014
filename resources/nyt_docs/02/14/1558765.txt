To the Editor:
Re ''The Real Man,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 13), and ''Bush's Duty and Privilege,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 13):
The truly surreal element in the aircraft carrier charade by President Bush is that this is the son of a man who flew in real combat, was shot down by a real enemy and really almost died as a result.
How can this impostor look the old man in the eye over the dinner table?
I didn't vote for either of them, but at least in this one respect Bush p√®re was the real thing.
