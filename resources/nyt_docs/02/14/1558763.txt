To the Editor:
Re ''Seeking Memories of Bush at an Alabama Air Base'' (news article, Feb. 13):
In the continuing controversy over where George W. Bush was in 1972 and 1973, why haven't the attendance sheets showing when and where he reported during his National Guard tour been produced?
It is hard to imagine that a soldier could just wander in and perform duty at his own discretion. I would think that there would be some kind of sign-in procedure.
Pay stubs are interesting, but they do not answer the question of when and where he reported.
