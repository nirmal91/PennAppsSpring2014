A judge in Texas released Eddie Griffin from jail yesterday on the condition that he be placed in the custody of John Lucas, the former N.B.A. player and coach and the founder of Right Step, a drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment facility.
Judge Mike Anderson of Harris County ordered Griffin to undergo 30 days of inpatient treatment at the facility. Then he must enter a halfway house in Houston for three months.
The Nets signed Griffin on Jan. 8 to a minimum guaranteed contract worth about $400,000, but he left the team later in the month to undergo treatment for alcohol abuse at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
Before Griffin could enter the center, however, he was ordered to jail on Feb. 2 after he was accused of violating a court-ordered curfew in connection with a felony assault charge.
That charge stemmed from an incident on Oct. 25, when a former girlfriend accused Griffin of punching her in the face and shooting a gun in her direction.
Before joining the Nets, the 6-foot-10 Griffin spent much of November and December at the Menninger Clinic in Houston undergoing treatment for depression and substance abuse.
