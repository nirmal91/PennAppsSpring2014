Re ''Conservatives Shine Spotlight on Kerry's Antiwar Record'' (news article, Feb. 13):
It is interesting that conservatives are able to dig up a photograph of Jane Fonda and John Kerry at an antiwar rally in 1970, but have been unable to find one of George W. Bush reporting for duty with the Alabama National Guard.
The 30-year-old image of Mr. Kerry and Ms. Fonda sitting several rows apart at a public function is far less troubling than the more recent photograph of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld greeting Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 1983.
