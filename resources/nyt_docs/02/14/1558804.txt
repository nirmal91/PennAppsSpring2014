Because of an editing error, the Antiques column in Weekend yesterday, about marine paintings, misstated the affiliation of a commentator, Norman Keyes. He is a spokesman for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where ''Manet and the Sea'' opens tomorrow, not for the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., which has an extensive marine collection.
