To the Editor:
''We're just like any other married couple,'' Laura Bush said (front page, Feb. 7). ''We talk about everything. We talk about our kids. We talk about our pets. We talk about what we're going to do this weekend. And then, of course, we talk about the campaign, to some extent.''
My wife and I talk about how we're going to pay the rent this month. We talk about which one of us must forgo glasses so the other can have needed bridge work done. We talk about the retirement we will probably never have or the house we'll never own.
These are the things ''just folks'' usually talk about.
When all the statistics are boiled down, there are still about nine million unemployed in this country. There are another 20 million underemployed. An inconceivable 20 percent of Americans don't have health insurance.
No, Laura, you're not ''just like any other married couple.'' You never have been, and that's the problem. If you were, you would be agonizing over the hemorrhaging of jobs and civil liberties in this country.
