To the Editor:
In ''Arabs, It's Your Move'' (column, Feb. 12), Thomas L. Friedman suggests that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel did not do enough to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas when he was the Palestinian prime minister. Yet the first thing Mr. Abbas and the current prime minister made clear upon taking office was that they would not act against the terrorist infrastructure.
Given that this was the first step on their part in the road map, isn't it obvious why Mr. Sharon did not do any more?
Now Mr. Friedman suggests that the Arabs offer to meet with President Bush and Mr. Sharon. They would do better, first, to cut off their financing for terrorist groups. Otherwise, why go?
