Canada's trade surplus widened to 5.4 billion Canadian dollars ($4.1 billion) in December from 4.5 billion Canadian dollars in November, Statistics Canada reported. The improvement was ascribed chiefly to a 3.6 percent rise in exports, with half of that gain coming from higher shipments of motor vehicles to the United States.
