The City Council speaker's chief of staff, Forrest R. Taylor, said yesterday that he would leave the position next month.
Council officials said that Mr. Taylor had decided to resign after the speaker, Gifford Miller, turned down his request for a raise. Mr. Taylor, a seasoned negotiator, is one of the highest-paid Council officials, earning $175,000 a year.
But Mr. Miller, a Democrat and likely mayoral candidate in 2005, said that Mr. Taylor was not leaving because of a salary dispute. ''He's leaving because he wants to pursue other options, and I wish him well,'' the speaker said.
Mr. Taylor, 42, declined to comment on the matter. ''It's time to look at other options,'' he said. ''It's a big world out there.''
Mr. Taylor previously worked as deputy director for operations at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where he oversaw the refurbishment of Grand Central Terminal. He was also a deputy press secretary in the Giuliani administration.
Mr. Taylor has become a familiar sight around City Hall in his button-down shirt and suspenders, but it is behind the scenes where he has had the most effect. Mr. Miller said that Mr. Taylor helped lead the Council through a fiscal crisis and oversaw the passage of landmark legislation.
A successor to Mr. Taylor is expected to be named in the next few weeks, Mr. Miller said.
Mr. Taylor said that he had not accepted another job, but city officials suggested that he might be headed for a position with the Bloomberg administration.
Mr. Taylor confirmed only that he was having ''conversations with a number of different folks'' about job opportunities, but declined to give any details.
