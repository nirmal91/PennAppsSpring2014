Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man during a raid before dawn on Friday in the northern West Bank, Israeli and Palestinian officials said.
An Israeli security official said soldiers were searching for a suspected car bomb in Qabatia, near Jenin, when they heard gunshots. The official said that the soldiers spotted a car driving from the area where shots were fired, and that they opened fire on it after the driver ignored warning shouts and shots.
The official said soldiers found no weapons in the car. Palestinians said the dead man was a farmer.
The official said soldiers had entered Qabatia after intelligence reports that militants there had prepared a car bomb.
Israeli security forces were on high alert on Friday. Palestinian militants threatened retaliation after Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinians, most of them gunmen, during a raid in Gaza Strip on Wednesday.
In Jerusalem, the Israeli police blocked Palestinian men under the age of 45 from attending Friday Prayer at the site revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount.
