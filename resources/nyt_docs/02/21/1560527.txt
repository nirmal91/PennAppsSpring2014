To the Editor:
Re ''Gay Marriage in the States'' (editorial, Feb. 18):
I hear the question asked over and over again: How would gay marriage have any negative impact on traditional marriage?
Gay marriage devalues the holy institution of marriage even further than it has been devalued by public policy errors like no-fault divorce. Marriage is a special relationship between a man and a woman that has served the good of society throughout history. Gay marriage redefines marriage as something less than an unalienable right ordained by nature, and nature's God.
Marriage is a public institution created for the good of society, not a private institution created for self-fulfillment. If I have an ounce of gold and the government suddenly announces that sandstone will now be called gold and valued equally, what will happen to the value of my gold? It will crash, and so will the economy.
So will it be with gay marriage. Marriage will be further devalued, and so will our entire social order.
