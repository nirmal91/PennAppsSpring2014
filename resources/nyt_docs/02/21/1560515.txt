The Vodafone Group's chief executive, Arun Sarin, has been telling investors and analysts that the company is not interested in buying Sprint Corp-PCS Group or Nextel Communications despite losing the bidding for AT&amp;T Wireless, analysts said on Friday.
Mr. Sarin also indicated that there was no imminent deal for the rest of its French mobile partner, SFR, which is controlled by Vivendi Universal.
Mr. Sarin, however, did not rule out the possibility of smaller deals, analysts said. And he indicated that Vodafone was interested in Eastern Europe.
After the setback on AT&amp;T Wireless on Tuesday, Mr. Sarin has been meeting with fund managers and analysts in London in an effort to calm concerns about Vodafone's strategy in the United States wireless market and elsewhere.
If it had won the bidding for AT&amp;T Wireless, Vodafone would have sold its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications. Some investors have said that Vodafone needs to increase its presence in the United States. But with its operational control and technology, many shareholders are concerned that it will be tempted to overpay in an acquisition.
''Vodafone ruled out Sprint PCS and Nextel as possible targets,'' Goldman, Sachs analysts said in a report. Although Mr. Sarin has pledged in the past that Vodafone will eventually purchase the remaining 56 percent of SFR it does not own, there is no deal forthcoming, according to the report.
Mr. Sarin, during the presentations in London this week, also stressed that the relationship between Vodafone and Verizon was not deteriorating, according to people who were present.
