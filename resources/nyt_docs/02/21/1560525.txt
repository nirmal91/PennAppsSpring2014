To the Editor:
A truth overlooked in the gay marriage debate (editorial, Feb. 18) is that marriage status granted by the states is a civil contract, not a religious one. Consequently, all marriage licenses are evidence of a civil union only.
Sanctity of marriage is a religious concept, relevant to unions consecrated by religious institutions. Perhaps the answer is to legislate civil unions for all, both straight and gay couples.
