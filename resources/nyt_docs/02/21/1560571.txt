An article on Thursday about a secretive European network used by the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan for the sale of nuclear technology misstated the location of Delft Technological University, where he once studied. It is in Delft, the Netherlands, not Leuven, Belgium. The article also misspelled the surname of a former Belgian member of the European Parliament who lobbied unsuccessfully for tighter export controls on nuclear technology. He is Paul Staes, not Stais.
