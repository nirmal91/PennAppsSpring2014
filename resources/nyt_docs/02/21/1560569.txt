Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, failed to disclose promptly the details of bank loans used to finance the final days of her 2000 campaign, a violation of campaign law, the Federal Election Commission has found. Ms. Cantwell was admonished for the violation but will face no further penalty. The determination was made public this week by the National Legal and Policy Center, a watchdog group that filed a complaint about the $3.8 million loans in 2001.
