Re ''Rushing to Say 'I Do' Before the City Is Told 'You Can't' '' (news article, Feb. 18):
In this day and age, what we call marriage is really just civil union at the outset, and the marriage grows from within. As a 30-year veteran on the marriage front, I can say with a great deal of confidence that allowing gay marriage as an option is likely to be more beneficial than not.
For most of us, marriage begins with a lifetime commitment, and we succeed or fail on that basis. If that is the standard, and same-sex partners are willing to live up to that goal, I fail to see the harm to anyone.
