To the Editor:
Re ''Gay Marriage in the States'' (editorial, Feb. 18):
My partner and I, both United States Army veterans, have been living in a monogamous relationship for 17 years, with the needs and responsibilities of our heterosexual married friends but none of their legal rights. More troublesome is that the rights we do have are in grave danger.
Acceptance of gay marriage is inevitable down the line, but this isn't the year to insist on it. Gay and lesbian couples ought to push instead for full equal rights for civil unions. That will provide far less ammunition for the religious right in the coming campaign.
