The French cosmetics giant L'Oréal posted double-digit growth for the 19th year in a row, reporting its net income rose 16.7 percent in 2003 to 1.5 billion euros ($1.2 billion). Sales figures reflected the drop of the euro against the dollar and slipped 1.8 percent, to 14 billion euros ($11 billion), last year, but the company said excluding currency exchange factors, sales grew 7 percent. The company's net operating profit excluding good will and exceptional items rose to 1.7 billion euros ($1.3 billion), up 13.5 percent from 2002. The 2003 results highlight the performance of the L'Oréal brands and its progress, the chief executive, Lindsay Owen-Jones, said.
