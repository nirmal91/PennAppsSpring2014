To the Editor:
Re ''Rushing to Say 'I Do' Before the City Is Told 'You Can't' '' (news article, Feb. 18):
The American experience has been sustained by the idea that we are a nation of laws and not of kings, and therefore no one is above the law. Whatever our view of allowing gay couples to be afforded the same privileges as married couples, we should not take comfort in what is happening in San Francisco.
Abandoning the rule of law should not be seen as the way to solve complex social issues. Would it be applauded if, say, a conservative mayor decided on his own that in his city abortions would be prohibited or that public money could constitutionally be given to private schools? If mayors are allowed, by a nod and a wink, to ignore the rule of law, where will we wind up?
