To the Editor:
Re ''Health Aides Who Get Sick Days? Ownership Is Good for Co-op Workers, but Union Complicates Mix'' (news article, Feb. 14):
While your article correctly portrayed a positive picture of the working conditions at Cooperative Home Care Associates, it is not the norm in the industry.
Most licensed home health care service agencies pay below poverty wages with little or no health benefits or paid sick time to home health aides who provide critical care at home to the elderly and infirm.
In most cases, it has been only through collective bargaining with the health care union 1199/SEIU that home health aides have won improvements.
I applaud Cooperative's efforts, but it's the rest of the industry that needs to step up and recognize the value of home health aides.
