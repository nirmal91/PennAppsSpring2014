To the Editor:
Re ''Gladly Taking the Blame for Health in the City'' (news article, Feb. 14):
I take exception to your statement that ''health commissioners retreated during the Giuliani administration, when public health was a back-burner issue.''
The city's Health Department, and specifically its commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, were integral to the quality-of-life enhancements achieved during the Giuliani administration. Not only did New York City become safer, it became healthier.
The Childhood Asthma Initiative started by Dr. Cohen is today resulting in record reductions in asthma cases. During the Giuliani administration, infant mortality rates in New York City fell below the national rate for the first time in a century. Dr. Cohen coordinated nationally acclaimed responses to the West Nile virus and the anthrax scare. Tuberculosis cases declined 60 percent.
Public health was always an issue at the top of the Giuliani agenda.
