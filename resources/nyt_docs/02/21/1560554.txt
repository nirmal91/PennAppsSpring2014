A parcel bomb exploded and wounded three police officers in the central city of Perugia in the latest of a series of similar incidents. The parcel had not been mailed to the police but to someone else, who apparently deemed it suspicious and turned it over to them. Parcel bombs have recently been sent to politicians and journalists in Italy, and police have said that local anarchists might be responsible.
