Carl and Clarence Aguirre, the Filipino twins joined at the head, successfully emerged from a third operation yesterday, sharing significantly fewer blood vessels.
The surgery was one of a series performed at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx to separate their common blood vessels. Doctors hope to perform a fourth operation as early as May to separate the boys, now 22 months old.
Dr. James T. Goodrich, who led the surgery, did not provide details about how many veins he was able to divide. But through a spokesman, Steven L. Osborne, the surgeon said he was ''ecstatic'' that the seven-hour operation had gone smoothly and according to plan. That plan was to work on one of the two largest veins the boys share in the back of their heads as well as on many smaller veins.
Two days before surgery, Dr. Goodrich said he intended to route the large vein toward Clarence, the smaller twin but who has the more extensive network of blood vessels in his head.
Carl's circulatory system, which would no longer able to use the large vein to drain blood from the head, would ideally start to rely on smaller, deeper veins to do the job.
The surgeon said that there were no problems with bleeding in either boy during the operation.
Dividing the blood vessels is delicate procedure, because the risk of bleeding is always present. Dr. Goodrich said that the boys were fortunate that their brain tissue does not appear to be fused and they seem to share only veins.
The twins have been living, along with their mother, at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., since September. Their first operation was done in October.
After separation, the boys' heads are to be covered with skin, said Dr. David A. Staffenberg, the craniofacial surgeon who will handle that part of the operation. In subsequent operations, Dr. Staffenberg plans to rearrange pieces of bone so that each boy has an intact and rounded skull.
