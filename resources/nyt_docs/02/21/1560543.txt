Mexico's central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in nearly a year, citing concerns over rising inflation expectations and wage increases. The Bank of Mexico's inflation target this year is 3 percent. But the inflation rate of 0.62 percent and average wage increases of 4.7 percent were both higher than expected last month. Mexico's economy is just beginning to feel a rebound after three years of stagnation and many analysts had expected the bank to leave policy unchanged rather than take any action that might brake the expansion.
