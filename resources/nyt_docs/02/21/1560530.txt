To the Editor:
Re ''What Runs in the Family Isn't Success'' (Arts &amp; Ideas, Feb. 14):
There are likely as many variations on sibling success as there are siblings. That brings us to the adage ''Three generations from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves.'' How much of the disparity we see is the natural decay from generation to generation of the skills needed for success?
Then there's the question of what defines success. Certainly it isn't prominence. Many manage to live a happy life and contribute to society without recognition outside a small circle. And others, like the Jackson siblings Michael and Janet, achieve prominence at a price no one would wish on any human being.
All we can hope for is to equip our offspring with those tools we can provide and wisdom has given us. At that point it's up to the genes, good fortune and the skill and effort of our children to make the most of their lives.
