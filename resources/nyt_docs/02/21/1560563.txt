A half-ton of cocaine valued at $32 million was found when Customs agents and a drug-sniffing dog inspected a truckload of cabbage at the Falfurrias checkpoint, 60 miles north of the Mexican border, the authorities said. Officers became suspicious when they noticed that the trailer doors were secured with an ordinary padlock, not a shipper's seal. The driver was arrested.
