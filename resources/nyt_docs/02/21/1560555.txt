Since the stately Thames River struggled back in recent decades from pollution so severe that it was considered almost devoid of marine life, more than 100 species of fish, including trout and salmon, have returned. But the renaissance has included at least one species, according to wildlife authorities, that is most unwanted -- the notorious Amazon piranha. Environmental officials reported that a four-inch red-bellied piranha was found dead on the deck of a boat moored in the river. Paul Hale, curator of the London Aquarium, theorized that a private aquarium owner had released the fish into the Thames, where it was picked up by a sea gull that did not have a taste for it and spit it out. There seemed to be no concern that schools of piranhas could be lurking in the river. The temperature of the Thames is too cold to support the fish, though officials sent out a warning that it is illegal to release non-native species into the wild.
