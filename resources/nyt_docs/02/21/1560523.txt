To the Editor:
The actions in California, Massachusetts and Vermont do establish social ''laboratories," as you note (editorial, Feb. 18). But I am shocked to see how unperturbed you are by the vastness of this experiment.
The experiment you describe has been foisted on us by a handful of judges and local officials who have circumvented the normal legislative process. Given the large number of people potentially involved, this is reckless and irresponsible.
Considering the damage wrought by other recent social experiments, like no-fault divorce, we should be more circumspect.
