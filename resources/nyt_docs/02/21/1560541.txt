French market regulators said yesterday that they would postpone the closing date for Sanofi-Synth√©labo's bid for its rival drug company Aventis, after Aventis accused regulators in court of failing to evaluate the proposal properly. The $60 billion hostile bid will be delayed until eight days after the Court of Appeals rules on whether regulators should have approved the Sanofi takeover. The closing was previously set for April 27. The appeal will be decided by Judge Christine Penichon, who will hold hearings starting March 1.
