The acting chief of the United States Park Police, Ben Holmes, said he would retire next month to work in the private sector. Mr. Holmes announced his decision less than three months after the suspension of the previous chief, Teresa C. Chambers, who was notified in December that she would be dismissed for violating federal rules regarding public statements on budget and staffing issues. Chief Chambers was placed on administrative leave on Dec. 5 after arguing publicly that her department was understaffed and underfinanced.
