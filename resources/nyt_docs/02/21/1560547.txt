A 12-year-old Queens girl who was taking a shortcut to catch a ride to school was sexually assaulted yesterday morning in an alley near her home, the police said.
The girl was attacked shortly after 8 a.m. near her home on Cold Spring Road in Far Rockaway, the police said.
''She leaves her home, cuts through a yard and is approached from behind,'' a police detective said. ''The male forces her into one of the alleyways, where he sexually assaulted her.''
The girl was wearing a school uniform when she was attacked, and her keys and black tights were left behind after the assault, one investigator said. She had been on her way to meet a friend, with whom she was going to go to school. The man, described by the girl as wearing a hooded garment, fled, the police said. One person in the area at the time reported seeing a white Nissan Pathfinder, which was later found about two blocks from where the attack occurred. But it was unclear whether the Pathfinder, which had been stolen, was linked to the attack.
After the attack, the girl went home and told her mother, who called the police.
Several neighborhood residents said the shortcut, a route well traveled by children in the area, runs through the rear yards of several homes, linking Bay 27th Street to Bay 25th Street.
