Re ''Fraud Kicks In Months Ahead of Medicare Drug Discount Card'' (news article, Feb. 17):
Isn't it amazing that almost all developed countries, except for the United States, can figure out how to provide free health insurance for their citizens?
The United States government is not even able to market drug discount cards without a problem.
It could learn from other countries, but then it would need to take care of the people instead of the lobbyists.
