To the Editor:
''What Runs in the Family Isn't Success'' (Arts &amp; Ideas, Feb. 14) did not mention one factor affecting the achievement of siblings: parental favoritism.
In my experience, parents may favor some siblings because of differences in personality or appearance. The parents lavish more resources on the favored children. Not surprisingly, favored siblings attain higher achievement levels.
Thus, another lesson can be drawn. Parents should bend over backward to avoid favoring some of their children over others.
