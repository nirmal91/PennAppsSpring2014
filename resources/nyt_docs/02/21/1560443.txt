Daniel Barenboim, the 61-year old Israeli conductor and pianist who has been the music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1991, has said he will give up the podium when his contract ends in 2006.
During his tenure with the orchestra, he has also held positions elsewhere. For instance, he is continuing as the general music director of the Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin.
In a statement that the Chicago orchestra issued on Thursday, Mr. Barenboim said his main reasons for stepping down were the increasing administrative, fund-raising and promotional demands placed on the music director of an American symphony orchestra.
''Chicago has been an important part of my musical life for more than 45 years,'' Mr. Barenboim said, referring to the period he performed there as a pianist as well as to what will be a 17-year tenure with the symphony, which named him music director-designate in 1989.
''After much soul-searching and reflection,'' he said, ''I have come to realize that the position and responsibilities of a music director in America are changing in that they require many nonartistic activities, and I feel I have neither the energy nor the time to fulfill them. It is this consideration that has led to this very difficult decision.''
William H. Strong, the orchestra's chairman, said a committee would be formed to search for a successor.
Lorin Maazel's contract with the New York Philharmonic also runs through 2006, but he is expected to renew it. Should Mr. Maazel decide not to, Mr. Barenboim is unlikely to be considered as a possible successor, since the Philharmonic job involves all the extra-musical requirements that he found objectionable in Chicago.
