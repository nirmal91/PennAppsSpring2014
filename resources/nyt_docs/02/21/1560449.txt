To the Editor:
Re ''Beware Generals Bearing a Grudge,'' by Jean Edward Smith (Op-Ed, Feb. 13), about Gen. Wesley K. Clark's run for president:
Mr. Smith argues that generals who became president didn't seek the office; it sought them. But he doesn't acknowledge the ''draft Clark'' movement that compelled General Clark's run.
Mr. Smith argues that presidential generals put others first. But he doesn't mention that when General Clark was wounded in Vietnam, he refused to be evacuated until he had safeguarded his troops.
Mr. Smith and I agree that General Clark doesn't compare to the likes of Ulysses S. Grant and William Henry Harrison. In fact, General Clark's willingness to fight for working families, his courage in battle and his intelligence make him more of a Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider.
Like General Clark, Roosevelt defies all of Mr. Smith's preconceptions about soldier-statesmen.
