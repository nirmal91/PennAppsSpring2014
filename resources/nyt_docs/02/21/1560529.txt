To the Editor:
''What Runs in the Family Isn't Success'' (Arts &amp; Ideas, Feb. 14) examines Dalton Conley's research on differences in achievement among siblings.
We must remember that there are many variables affecting success. For example, some parents are vocal in their disappointment about not having a girl or a boy. A teacher, mentor or other inspirational adult can have an impact on one child and not another. A single-parent household, a gay-couple household or an interracial household can also have varying effects on success.
According to the article, Mr. Conley thinks that birth order affects children for financial, not psychological, reasons. But when a third child is born, a middle child has been displaced and is forced to vie for his parents' attention, which can create a spectrum of unhealthy emotional feelings.
