If nothing else, Theodora Skipitares's ''Odyssey: The Homecoming'' explains why it took poor Odysseus so darned long to get home from the Trojan War. He and everyone else in ancient Greece apparently moved in ultraslow motion. Snails and turtles would have had to stop and wait for these guys to catch up.
Not that Ms. Skipitares's show, the second of a trilogy, is overly long; the tale is done in less than 90 minutes. It's just that when a story is told with puppets and largely without words, speed takes a back seat. This ''Odyssey'' unfolds at roughly the pace of a ''Mark Trail'' comic strip.
But the story is secondary. Ms. Skipitares's show, at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street in the East Village, through Feb. 29, is primarily a visual experience. A colorful collection of shadow and other types of puppets are used to tell about some of Odysseus' adventures on the way home, with video projections and elaborate music by Arnold Dreyblatt and Tim Schellenbaum adding to the mix.
Among the most memorable elements are some strange creatures with video screens for heads. A segment early in the piece that bluntly links the classic tale to modern war, presumably the current one in Iraq, seems didactic, clich√©-ridden and at odds with the elegance of the rest of the show. But elsewhere the merging of the ancient and the modern works just fine. A fight scene in which Ms. Skipitares's puppets are superimposed onto clips from old films is very clever.
Last year Ms. Skipitares tackled the war itself in ''Helen, Queen of Sparta,'' and the third piece of the trilogy, about the prelude to the war, is scheduled for next year.
