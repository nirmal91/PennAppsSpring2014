An article on Sunday about turmoil over cost cutting at the Rocky Mountain region's largest foundation, the Daniels Fund, referred incorrectly to the election of Stephen M. Schuck and Brian Deevy to the board. It occurred in August 2003, not during the November meeting at which they voted for the cuts.
The article misstated the location of the fund's headquarters, and a picture was published in error. The headquarters is in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, not the suburb named Cherry Hills Village. The picture showed the office of Daniels &amp; Associates, the business of the fund's creator, the late Bill Daniels.
