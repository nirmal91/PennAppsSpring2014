The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement intended to increase security on the border and transport illegal Mexican migrants home rather than simply sending them to the border's edge. In recent years, the trek across the border by hundreds of thousands of migrants has led to roughly one death a day. The agreement, the details of which remain unfinished, is part of the larger discussion between the two nations about President Bush's proposal to grant temporary legal status to some migrants. That proposal, said Asa Hutchinson, under secretary for border and transportation security, would face ''rough sailing unless members of Congress and the American public understand that we have the capability of securing our border.''
