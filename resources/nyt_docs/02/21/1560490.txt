Senate Democrats who worry that President Bush is stacking the courts with right-wing judges of dubious judicial qualifications may have to think twice before taking another holiday. Yesterday, Mr. Bush took advantage of Congress's absence by making his second recess appointment since the first of the year. This time he named Alabama's attorney general, William Pryor Jr., to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Last month, Mr. Bush used the same mechanism to promote a federal judge, Charles Pickering Sr. of Mississippi, to the 5th Circuit.
Like Judge Pickering's appointment, Judge Pryor's had been blocked by a Senate filibuster, so Mr. Bush chose the only avenue available to get his man on the court. Recess appointments are, of course, perfectly legal, but that does not make the president's choice any better. Judge Pryor has a narrow-minded judicial temperament and a ferocious attachment to an ideological agenda that puts him well to the right of the judicial mainstream.
Judge Pryor has testified before Congress in favor of dropping a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act, argued in favor of a Texas law that made gay sex illegal and taken outlandish positions on ''federalism,'' a states' rights philosophy that seeks to undercut federal rights. He has reserved his most intemperate remarks for the issue of reproductive rights, declaring at one point that Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling upholding abortion rights, had ''ripped the Constitution and ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.''
The recess appointment will last only until sometime in the fall of 2005. At that point, Judge Pryor will need Senate confirmation. Given his record, even that brief term seems much too long.
