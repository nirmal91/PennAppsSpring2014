Donald A. Miller, 41, who was convicted of robbery and murder in 1983, would probably not have received a death sentence had prosecutors shared mitigating information with defense lawyers, a judge has ruled. The judge, Kenneth M. Hoyt of Federal District Court in Houston, ordered the state to retry Mr. Miller within six months or remove him from death row, where he has spent 21 years. The documents withheld from Mr. Miller's defense involved witnesses who changed their statements to the authorities.
