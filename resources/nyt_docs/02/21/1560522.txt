To the Editor:
Re ''Gay Marriage in the States'' (editorial, Feb. 18):
Your support for gay marriage is praiseworthy. It is not the sex of the marriage partners that threatens this social institution, as conservatives would have us believe, but the willingness of each couple to abide by self-determined levels of commitment.
The divorce rate in same-sex marriages is likely to be much lower than that of heterosexual marriages. With shotgun weddings and nuptials resulting from parental pressure unlikely, gays and lesbians have a running head start to successful unions.
