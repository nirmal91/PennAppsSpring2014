Treasury Department officials said they had frozen the assets of the Ashland office of a Saudi Arabian charity, Al Haramain Islamic Foundation. Officials searched the foundation's office as part of an investigation into possible violations of tax and currency laws by two of its officers. The federal government has labeled foreign branches of Al Haramain supporters of terrorism, but representatives of the Ashland office have repeatedly denied any connection to terrorism.
