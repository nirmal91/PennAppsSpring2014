A maintenance worker was crushed to death Thursday night at a foundry in Elmira, N.Y., the 10th fatality since 1995 at plants owned by McWane Inc., an Alabama-based maker of cast-iron pipe with one of the nation's most extensive records of workplace safety violations.
The worker, Timothy J. Blow, 45, was working alone when he became caught in a conveyor belt in a new sand-collection system at the plant, Kennedy Valve. His body was found by co-workers a little after midnight, according to the Elmira police.
In January 2003, McWane was the subject of a series of articles and a television documentary by The New York Times, the PBS program ''Frontline'' and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Two of the earlier deaths examined by The Times involved workers caught in conveyor belts at plants in Texas and Alabama. A third occurred at the Elmira plant in a furnace explosion. McWane ultimately plead guilty to a state felony and paid a $500,000 fine.
McWane is now the subject of a sweeping federal investigation. The first indictments came last December, when five senior managers at a plant in New Jersey were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate safety and environmental laws.
After the incident Thursday night in Elmira, McWane issued a written statement saying, ''Both the foundry and the machine shop have been closed out of respect.'' Mr. Blow's family, it said, had been offered support services. The company did not say when the plant would reopen.
Thomas Dininny, a union official, said there had been significant improvements in safety practices and working conditions in the last year.
