To the Editor:
I do not agree with David Brooks's view of a bifurcated Democratic Party, with Presidents Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy on one side and Jimmy Carter on the other (column, Feb. 17).
More than 500 American troops have died in the Mideast in the past year, with little progress toward ending the region's longer-term conflicts and bloodshed. The Camp David accords may not have solved the region's conflicts, but they will always be looked upon as among the first significant steps toward any sort of peace that may or may not come to pass in the region.
I believe that Presidents Kennedy and Truman, and perhaps even Richard M. Nixon, would appreciate the power of President Carter's diplomatic efforts, particularly when compared with the aftermath of the war in Iraq.
