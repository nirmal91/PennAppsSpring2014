Review: Acting rationally Rational Agents
￼￼￼ 
Rational behavior: doing the right thing
The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information
Doesn't necessarily involve thinking – e.g., blinking reflex – but thinking should be in the service of rational action

￼Review: Rational agents
 An agent is an entity that perceives and acts
 This course is about effective programming techniques for
designing rational agents
 Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories P*
to actions:
[f: P*A]
 For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the
agent (or class of agents) with the best performance
 Caveat: computational limitations make perfect rationality
unachievable
 design best program for given machine resources

￼Two Approaches to AI
 Symbolic representations of the world
• Relations between entities
—“Mitch’s bicycle is red”
– (isa B3241 bicycle) (color B3231 red) (owns B3241 P119) – (isa P119 person) (name P119 “Mitch”)
• Explicit logical models
• Logical inference, Search
• Chess, Sudoko, computer games, ...
 Instance-based and statistical models
￼• •
Prediction by look-up or by weighted combinations —P(y=bicycle)=c0 +c1 x1 +c2 x2 +c3 x3 +...

￼Agents and environments
An agent is specified by an agent function f:P a that maps sequences of percepts P to an action a from a set A:
P=[p0, p1, ... , pt] A={a0, a1, ... , ak}
￼￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 9

￼Agents
 An agent is anything that can be viewed as
• perceiving its environment through sensors and
• acting upon that environment through actuators
 Human agent:
• Sensors: eyes, ears, ...
• Actuators: hands, legs, mouth, ...
 Robotic agent:
• Sensors: cameras and infrared range finders
• Actuators: various motors
 Agents include humans, robots, softbots, thermostats, ... CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 10
￼￼
￼Agent function & program
 The agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce f
• agent = architecture + program
 “Easy” solution: table that maps every possible
sequence P to an action a
• One small problem: exponential in length of P
￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 11

￼Example: A Vacuum-cleaner agent
 Percepts: location and contents, e.g., (A,dirty) • (Idealization: locations are discrete)
￼￼￼A
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼B
￼￼￼￼￼ Actions: move, clean, LEFT, RIGHT SUCK

￼Rational agents II
 Rational Agent: For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure.
 Performance measure: An objective criterion for success of an agent's behavior, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence.
 A performance measure for a vacuum-cleaner agent might include one or more of:
• +1 point for each clean square in time T
• +1 point for clean square, -1 for each move
• -1000 for more than k dirty squares
￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 14

￼Rationality is not omniscience
 Ideal agent: maximizes actual performance, but
needs to be omniscient. • Usually impossible.....
— But consider tic-tac-toe agent... • Rationality  Success
 Agents can perform actions in order to modify future percepts so as to obtain useful information (information gathering, exploration)
 An agent is autonomous if its behavior is determined by its own experience with ability to learn and adapt
(Book’s definition – standard usage differs.)

￼Task environment
 To design a rational agent we need to specify a task environment
• a problem specification for which the agent is a solution
 PEAS: to specify a task environment • Performancemeasure
• Environment

 Defining Task Environments
 Environment types
 Agent types
￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 24

￼Environment types: Definitions I
 Fully observable (vs. partially observable): An agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time.
 Deterministic (vs. stochastic): The next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent.
• If the environment is deterministic except for the actions of other agents, then the environment is strategic.
 Episodic (vs. sequential): The agent's experience is divided into atomic "episodes" during which the agent perceives and then performs a single action, and the choice of action in each episode depends only on the episode itself.
￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 25

￼Environment types: Definitions II
 Static (vs. dynamic): The environment is unchanged while an agent is deliberating.
• The environment is semidynamic if the environment itself does not change with the passage of time but the agent's performance score does.
 Discrete (vs. continuous): A limited number of distinct, clearly defined percepts and actions.
 Single agent (vs. multiagent): An agent operating by itself in an environment.
(See examples in AIM,
however I don’t agree with some of the judgments)

￼Agent types
 Goal of AI practitioner:
given a PEAS task environment,
—construct agent function f,
—design an agent program that implements f on
a particular architecture
 Four basic agent types in order of increasing generality:
• Simple reflex
• Model-based reflex
• Goal-based
• Utility-based
￼￼CIS 521 - Intro to AI - Spring 2014 28

￼Simple reflex agent
￼￼￼￼￼function REFLEX_VACUUM_AGENT( percept ) returns an action
(location,status) = UPDATE_STATE( percept )
if status = DIRTY then return SUCK; else if location = A then return RIGHT; else if location = B then return LEFT;
