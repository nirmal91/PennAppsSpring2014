3 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania Wait a minute... 
n? ? What is actually going on behind the curtains? 
n? ? How is the machine responsible for 'www.google.com' found? 
n? ? What systems and protocols are involved in getting the page from 
California to my laptop? 
n? ? How do services like Google or Facebook scale to millions of 
requests every day?  
n? ? How come they are almost always available? 
n? ? How would you program a system of this scale? 
n? ? How does Google download 'the entire web'? What kind of system 
can hold that much data? 
n? ? How do you answer a search in 0.13 seconds, and find the most 
relevant pages among 91,000,000 candidates? 
n? ? Why do the best results always seem to be on the first page? 
n? ? How did Google know I meant the city center in Philadelphia? 
n? ? ... 
4 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania Why should I care? 
n? ? Understand what's underneath the Web 
n? ? How does it work? What are its strengths? Its shortcomings? 
n? ? Technologies: Interdomain routing, DNS, HTTP, XML, ... 
n? ? Understand the underlying principles

iTunes, Facebook, eBay, ... 
n? ? Main goals: 
n? ? Understand the technology (DNS, HTTP, TCP/IP, cookies, ...) 
n? ? Underlying principles (consistency models, scalable algortihms, ...) 
n? ? Basics of system design / how to make the right choices 
n? ? Case studies of concrete systems (Google, AWS, BitTorrent, ...) 
n? ? How to handle massive amounts of data 
n? ? Find it, gather it, encode it, store it, process it, integrate it, keep it consistent, 
extract useful answers from it, rank it, deliver it quickly, prevent its loss, ... 
n? ? Technical skills (using cloud platform, programming a data center) 
n? ? Hands-on experience with a concrete system (web search) 
n? ? Working in teams, evaluating your solution, ...

n? ? If you're on the waiting list, I cannot guarantee that 
you will get a spot 
n? ? But we will enroll you if spots become available, i.e., if someone 
else drops the course 
n? ? If you have questions about the waiting list, please 
contact Mike Felker 
21 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania Policies: Collaboration 
n? ? All assignments must be done individually 
n? ? Only exception is the final project (teams of four allowed) 
n? ? All the code you submit has to be your own 
n? ? Only exception: Code we have provided or explicitly authorized 
n? ? NO code you have found on the web. NO sharing with others. 
n? ? Penn's Code of Academic Integrity applies  
n? ? No cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, multiple submissions, gaining an unfair 
advantage, or facilitating (!) academic dishonesty 
n? ? It's not worth it!! Penalties can be severe: 
http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_violations.html  
 
n? ? Zero tolerance policy to ensure fairness 
n? ? We will use various tools to actively look for cheating 
n? ? These tools work: We have caught several cases in the past

n? ? Everyone gets three 'joker days' 
n? ? Each joker automatically extends any  
homework deadline by 1 day 
n? ? Cannot be used for the final project / final report

n? ? We will provide a web interface for redeeming jokers 
n? ? I am planning to award some extra jokers in class 
n? ? Absolutely no extensions without jokers 
n? ? 20% penalty for each late day without a joker 
n? ? Some recommendations: 
n? ? Please start the homeworks early!!! 
n? ? Save your jokers for unforeseen events 
n? ? Interview calls, deadlines in other courses, tricky bugs in your code, ... 
25 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania Policies: Slides 
n? ? I will make the slides available after the lecture 
n? ? On the course web page: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis455/ 
n? ? However, not everything will be on the slides 
n? ? Sometimes the slides will just contain a question for us to discuss 
n? ? I'd encourage you to take some notes 
26 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania Disclaimer 
n? ? This remains a "bleeding edge" course 
n? ? We are looking at some of today's hottest topics 
n? ? This means that we'll be using some immature technology 
n? ? Not everything has been tested and validated ahead of time; we'll do 
the best we can to smooth over the bugs 
n? ? Focus is on hands-on experience 
n? ? Substantial implementation project; goal is a level of comfort in 
managing large, complex software development with 3rd party code 
n? ? As in the real world: learning APIs, dealing with inadequate tools, 
working with incomplete and/or ambiguous specifications (RFCs etc.)!  
n? ? Most of you will find this a struggle!   
n? ? You’ll spend many hours debugging! 
n? ? We hope it will be a fun course, though… 
n? ? … and an interesting one!

n? ? Tens of thousands of interconnected networks 
n? ? Examples: AT&T, Comcast, Level 3, Penn, Verizon, ...

© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives What exactly is the Web? 
n? ? A collection of documents and other resources that 
are interconnected (via URLs) 
n? ? Implemented by HTTP servers that publish HTML, XML, and a few 
other content types, plus a huge number of web clients 
n? ? Builds on a number of Internet protocols: DNS, TCP, IP, ...  
(other Internet services exist and use other protocols) 
n? ? Web services and custom applications sometimes use HTTP in ways 
it was not designed for 
32 
© 2013 A. Haeberlen, Z. Ives University of Pennsylvania What is an Internet system? 
n? ? Not just a web server or web application… 
n? ? An application built over the Internet, whose 
functionality is distributed across multiple machines 
n? ? Typically, at least in a client-server or server-to-server 
fashion, but may have many more participants 
n? ? Typically, data and/or code must be exchanged in 
distributed fashion for the functioning of the application 
n? ? Often, the data must be partitioned, replicated, translated, 
etc. (“shards” in Google-speak) 
n? ? Often, there is heterogeneity, e.g., code runs in multiple 
different environments, is written in different languages, etc. 
n? ? Often, there are concerns about handling failures, firewalls, 
attacks, …
